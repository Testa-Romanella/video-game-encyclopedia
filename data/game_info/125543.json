Cells now age, are able to die of old-age, and their age affects reproduction and chance to die of lonelyness. The \"Growth\" stage occurs when a cell that doesn't suffer from eliminating factors has enough room to expand. Big cells follow the same rules as regular cells.<br/></p>\n<p>The downloadable blend-files contain the final work, as well as a version, featuring vanilla game of life rules.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7c/d7c60ec335c550aceda52d4386950c3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Markus Glanzer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
