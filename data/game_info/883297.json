Of course, by doing so they will have to destroy the beautiful surrounding nature and eventually cast out any living animals that use it as a habitat. So, at the end we must ask ourselves the question: <strong>\u201c</strong><strong>Wait, are we the bad guys?\u201d</strong>\u00a0 </p>\n<p>The game is played in <strong>6 </strong>rounds. Each player will have a total of <strong>18 </strong>dice, which represents their corporation <strong>wealth and power</strong>, during the course of the game. They will use <strong>3</strong> dice, that will be determined randomly, each turn.\u00a0 There are <strong>24 </strong>random generated Dice placement fields on the map and in groups <strong>from 1 to 4</strong>, <strong>6 </strong>premade dice placement fields form<strong> 1 to 6</strong> on the centre Map Tile and <strong>6 </strong>premade dice placement fields <strong>form 1 to 6</strong> outside the Map for a total of <strong>36 </strong>placement fields.</p>\n<p>The Players will score points when they take control of the map tiles on the board and during the final scoring after the 6 rounds are over.<strong> The Player with the highest number of points will win the game.</strong></p>\n<p>QUICK RULES:</p>\n<ul><li>At the start of every round, the players can use special powers - Swap Dice or Rerolls.</li><li>After the Special Power phase of the round, the players proceed to deploying their dice.</li><li>At first, the players must deploy their first die on the edges of the map - hex tiles only with 1 die slot.</li><li>On subsequent turns, the players must deploy their dice on hexes adjacent to other hexes that they already have presence on.</li><li>After one hex is filled - all die slots are filled - the hex is scored and will count later for the scoring of the player.<ul><li>Ties are won by the last player placed die on the hex</li></ul></li><li>When all hexes on the board are filled - the game ends and scoring will happen.</li></ul>\n<p>DETAILED GAME MANUAL:</p>\n<ul><li>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CfxAXFKjHwtDgaV8cXYbEtWAwCwV7QXtm8ZcqKSj5_M/...</li></ul><p>KNOWN ISSUES:</p><ul><li>There's a chance the player could be blocked from making valid action during his turn.
