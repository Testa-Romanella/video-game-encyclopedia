However each spell requires a series of hand gestures and chants in order to teleport the package to the correct location.  </p>\n<p>Being a Wizard/Delivery man isn't easy though.  Each package is different and is heading to different locations, therefore each package requires a different set of gestures.  Even a single incorrect gesture could cause the package to be sent to the incorrect location.   Your customers expect excellence - 1 incorrect or delayed package can ruin your business.     </p>\n<p>Perform the correct gestures in a timely fashion on each package and Teleport them to their desired locations.</p>\n\r\nGameplay &amp; Controls\r\n<p><strong>This game is currently only able to be played with Mouse &amp; Keyboard</strong> </p>\n<strong>KEYS</strong><strong>ACTION</strong>Number keys: 1, 2, and 3Move to a different teleportation circleArrow keys (\u2191\u2193\u2192\u2190)Perform gestures \r\n<p>There are 3 Teleportation Circles that will spawn packages throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Move between the Teleportation Circles using 1, 2, and 3 key in order to access different packages.</p>\n<p>Once you've selected a package, use the Arrow keys to perform the gestures corresponding to the package (shown at the bottom of the screen)</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>I used some free art assets created by others in my game:</p>\n<ul><li>Medieval Dungeon props/environment - https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/a5b6a73fea5340bda9b8ac33d877c9e2</li><li>Banner icons - https://pixabay.com/vectors/banners-celebration-medieval-1640595/</li><li>Font - https://www.1001freefonts.com/enchanted-land.font</li></ul>\r\n\r\nDeveloper Note\r\n<p>Due to work obligations I ran out of time creating this so currently there is no sound and the visuals are pretty barebones.\u00a0 I apologize for this, I'm going to update the game in the coming days to have sounds, music, and better visuals (wizard character).\u00a0 I'll remove this note once I do.\u00a0 Unfortunately that probably won't make it in before the game jam deadline.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T07:33:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6add7c3119c2becc187e03bcab7967b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Harris"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
