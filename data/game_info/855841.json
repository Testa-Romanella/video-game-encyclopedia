You\u2019ve been hired by a mother to take care of their little hell spawn for a whole\u00a0week.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game, your goal is to keep the baby warm and healthy whilst discarding critters who have nothing but evil intentions. You can keep the baby warm by letting\u00a0them rest in the furnace or by kicking it around. In fact, kicking the baby is pretty much the only way of defending yourself from these demons, so I hope you didn\u2019t skip leg day.</p>\n<p>The mom also hired you to watch out for \u201cspecial\u201d enemies, who have a rotating star around them. They have special items called \u201cSoul Eggs\u201d, which are super valuable. Make sure to collect as many as you can.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s about it.. don\u2019t disappoint the mother!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T16:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/025/025920dc90843f3f0090a9722df7829c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GenyaDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
