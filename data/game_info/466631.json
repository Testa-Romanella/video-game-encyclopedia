Because if you don't... he'll start to Panic! And when he panics, he will start putting in his own moves that might start making matters worse.</p>\n<p>If you get desperate for water, you might want to seek The Magic Button (TM) which will refill all the beakers on screen! But because Wickworth used it so many times before it doesn't quite pop back up as regularly as it should!</p>\n<p>If Wickworth's fuse reaches the end, he'll promptly expire and that's GAME OVER. I guess, if anything, it's for his own good as he'll only play with matches again (DON'T DO THAT PEEPS. REMEMBER THE STORY WITH THE MOTH? CHILDHOOD TRAUMA RIGHT THERE!)</p>\n<p>Oh, and don't try to be clever by telling him to do many things at once. He's not that bright. (I mean, he has set himself on fire multiple times. That should be the litmus test here for his level of intelligence and wisdom!)<br/>And we sincerely apologise if the world doesn't work properly. Let's just say it's their penance for BEING CRUEL GODS WHO BESTOWED A STICK OF DYNAMITE WITH LIFE. (Note: We do feel bad for Wickworth! We aren't monsters!)</p>\n<p>-- CONTROLS --</p>\n<p>M - Mute All Audio (and upset the Audio Guy by Proxy)<br/>F7 - Reset Room (ripping space time asunder)<br/>F8 - Exit Game (because you've had enough, which is fair)<br/>Enter - Run Move Commands (as clicking is beneath you; exemplar of keyboards)</p>\n<p>--THANKS TO--<br/></p>\n<p>GreenBatGames gives massive thanks to following the creators for the use of:<br/></p><p>\n</p>\n<p>Fonts:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Hynnings Handwriting (HyningsHandwriting-Regular.ttf)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0https://www.dafont.com/hynings-handwriting.font?fpp=200&amp;l[]=10&amp;l[]=1<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0hyninggan@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Sound:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Moon Hooch x Andrew Huang Sample Pack<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Andrew Huang<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Moon Hooch <br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Open Music Project Sample Pack<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(This was downloaded circa 2008!
