Something that was substantial yet short enough to be able to pull off during a jam. The game came together organically - I had little to no\u00a0conscious idea of what I was making - but had a good feeling about it throughout the entire jam. I started with the intro and then continued from there with only gut feeling as a guide, planning nothing but the mood. Then I iterated and smoothed some bumps out. I'm proud of it, even if it's rough around the edges.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOh, and there's a ton of music that went unused - I'll revisit the soundtrack at a later time together with remixes from some friends. So if you dig the soundtrack - there's more coming.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCheck out the original soundtrack here:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\thttp://calleleppajoki.bandcamp.com/album/she-dream...\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI hope you like it.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/321/321d9c130658f597da14fd9fc512ae4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["dbhgamer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
