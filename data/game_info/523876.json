Progressive thinking and activities were prohibited and the priests' laws were definite. The kingdoms in the continent took counsel from their high priests and ruled with an iron fist. The society was largely orthodox and patriarchal and people who sought to oppose that social structure and sail against the waves were shunned or punished. On top of that the mingling of Godly magic and sorcery had created many twisted spells and forbidden arts in this land which made the life of common folks even more difficult.\r\n</p>\n<p>Among all this a sweet girl named Kori lost her parents when they were taken prisoner by the kingdom of her land. She escaped from the clutches of the kingdom but alas she was just an innocent girl, unaware of the ways and the treachery of the world. She had always been in the love and care of her parents and now suddenly she was left astray. All she could rely on was a shunned witch, her son and the intense desire to unite with her parents.</p>\n<p>Will you guide Kori through this hostile realm and help her in her mission?</p>\n<p>Play Kori's Fable Visual Novel today on Itch.io.</p>\n<p><strong>This is the demo of the game.
