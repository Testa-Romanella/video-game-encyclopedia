The game was created as an interesting challenge and dev experience for the computer on which I played my first game sometime in 1992.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>The\u00a0GLAZX\u00a0is a very simple action game in which the reaction speed is more important than solving puzzles or strategic planning.</p>\n<p>The glazes are placed on a\u00a0grid-like map\u00a0with passable cells and obstacles, and can be moved to the right one cell. The glaz emits\u00a0deadly rays. The wall prevents your moving and stops rays. Randomly\u00a0bonus boxes\u00a0will appear on the map with energy, additional rays and other bonus abilities. Immediately after damaging the glaz can not shoot for a while and can not be damaged again. It's called\u00a0\"ghost time\". The winner is the glaz that\u00a0destroyed all\u00a0opponents.</p>\n<p>There are\u00a0several modifications\u00a0of the game which can be selected in the options. \"NORMAL\" and \"PRO\" slightly different lives and rays count, and other parameters. In the \"NO GHOST\" there are a lot of lives and there is no ghost time. In \"ONE SHOT\" you have only one shot, the bonus also gives only one extra shot, but the bonuses appear frequently.</p>\n<p>The game includes 12 maps (+ 4 secret map), 4 types of bonuses, 4 game modes, 2 special attack movements. Zx 128 version contains AY chip title music and advanced sound effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus boxes</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Live\u00a0- adds 1 life.</li><li>Ammo\u00a0- refills ammo. Adds 5 rays.</li><li>Super ghost time\u00a0- adds 10 sec. The glaz can shoot during the super ghost time.</li><li>Rocket Sight\u00a0- adds 1 shot of instant death ray, it is impossible to avoid this rocket ray.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Special moves</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Curved ray\u00a0- the glaz can turn the ray after the shot. Press and hold\u00a0Fire\u00a0+ move in the\u00a0any direction\u00a0except forward.</li><li>Fast ray\u00a0- the glaz can emit a super fast ray. Wherein the hit probability is 50%. Also with a 50% probability the ray can go through the wall. Press and hold\u00a0Fire\u00a0+\u00a0forward direction\u00a0move. (in the same direction the shot was made)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Keyboard control</strong></p>\n<ul><li>GLAZ 1\u00a0- W, A, S, D, F</li><li>GLAZ 2\u00a0- I, J, K, L, O</li><li>Pause game\u00a0- N,\u00a0Exit game\u00a0- M</li></ul>\n<p>In the options menu you can choose the alternative control including\u00a0Kempston\u00a0and\u00a0Sinclair\u00a0joystick.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Idea, code and graphics: Eugeny Novikov</li><li>Additional art: Lorc, Delapouite, font: \"I can remember\" NES game, and tiles from some retro games.</li><li>AY title music \"Red Alert!
