Out of the 100 contenders taking part in the competition, our team was the one that won the gamejam! The theme of the gamejam was: \"Inconvenient superpowers\". That's why\u00a0all of the in-game superpowers have some kind of drawback effect.<br/><br/>In the game you play as a Yokai hunter. Your goal is to defeat all demons that stand in your way. Each time you clear a room of demons you get to choose one of the two special powers. Each special power has it's positive effect, as well as a negative one. You will have to choose wisely and decide which power will be more useful to you.<br/><br/>Each time you play you will encounter a different dungeon as well as different enemies. Rooms that you fight in, are procedurally generated and enemies spawn randomly. Apart from that each time you will have to choose between different superpowers. They are also randomly generated!<br/><br/>Yokai Hunter is a game prototype that we might expand in the future. Currently it's in a alpha stage and it's only a demo of the game. You might encounter some bugs when playing.\u00a0<br/>Let us know in the comments what you think about our game. Feedback is appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T10:14:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/3817bcae164bba4cb222a70e8aa74dbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flame Flicker Interactive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
