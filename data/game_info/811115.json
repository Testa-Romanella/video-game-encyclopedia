Its in very early developpement, a prototype so that people can give me feedback on the way things feel so I can make the game as enjoyable and as good as I can. The game will be low poly, for it to run on most computers and mobile. The game will be published on itch.io, Steam and Google Play.\u00a0Donations are appreciated, anyone who donates before beta release will get free access to the full game as it helps finance the project. Also, don't hesitate to give me feedback, ask questions, requests or give me tips to make the game better. That is the reason this prototype has been released!
