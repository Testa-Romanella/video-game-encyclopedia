Decent range, combos, kill power, projectile, etc.\r\n</p>\n<p>Reimu - A rushdown combo character. The best combo potential in the game with good kill confirms at the cost of having a very exploitable recovery and slow movement\u00a0speed\r\n</p>\n<p>Kirby - Projectile spam zoner. Excels at annoying the opponent and getting them offstage to spike them. He is also the smallest and lightest character, has 5 jumps instead of a recovery move.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ness - All-rounder with great projectiles and decent combos, while being relatively light and having a poor recovery</p>\n<p>Adelaine - Decent zoner with great kill power while also being slow and heavy\r\n</p>\n<p>Android 18 - A grappler with great damage, knockback and combos. Has pretty short range and slow speed but with a few good movement options\r\n</p>\n<p>Cuphead - Semi-rushdown semi-projectile spammer combination. Relatively light and mediocre range\r\n</p>\n<p>Suwako - Has great range and a good projectile at the cost of her size and weight. Can triple jump and has tricky movement options\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T09:19:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fd/1fd6e538e10a314ba3fe571b981cde47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MellowIsDumb"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
