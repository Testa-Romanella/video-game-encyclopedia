{"id": 290266, "slug": "tic-tac-tarantula", "name": "Tic-Tac-Tarantula", "name_original": "Tic-Tac-Tarantula", "description": "Tic-Tac-Tarantula is a two player game that is similar to the tic-tac-toe, but with animated tarantulas.  The game can be played in the tradition two-dimensional mode or for an added challenge you can play the game in three dimensions.  The object of the game is to get three tarantulas in a straight line.  The line can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.  Sound easy?  Well, maybe not since when two sharp players match wits the game will usually end in a tie.<br/><br/>PLAYS: During a turn a player slides one of their tarantulas to an unused space on the tic-tac-toe board.  Game strategies vary but usually it is necessary to block the opponent while at the same time trying to get three in a row.<br/><br/>WINNING:  A player wins the game by making a 'tarantula chain' of three spiders.  The chain can be in any direction, vertical, horizontal or diagonal.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T04:40:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7f/b7f4e1fabf4b52cd8d4c1e0a7a8cb4cb_RyczQ67.jpg", "website": "http://www.venturaes.com/iosapps/tic_tac_tarantula.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ventura Educational Systems"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Ventura Educational Systems"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
