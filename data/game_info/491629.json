Rather than memorizing flashcards or answering forced-choice questions, in Sheng Tian, players intuitively learn words while using them to complete tasks and solve puzzles. As you play, Sheng Tian builds your explicit knowledge, but also unconscious, procedural fluency.<h3>Help Us Build The Future of Language Learning </h3>If you like this episode, support us!
