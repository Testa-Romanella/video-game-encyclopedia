He has a wife that he has been with for eleven years, and a nine year old daughter. They have created the normal life that many strive for... nice car, nice house, good jobs....<br/><br/>However, the last year has brought some concern to light for our main character. His wife has become more distant, reserved, and indulgent. He contemplates that he is overthinking it all. When he brings the topic up to his wife, she calls him crazy and states how busy she has been with work. However things are not okay in this seemingly normal suburban home. Our main character discovers his wife's affair and that is where \"Illusion of Being\" really digs in.<br/><br/>Our main character is forced to make choices he wishes he never had to. Will he succumb to depression and possibly upset those who care for him? Will he embrace the single life and have more attention than he ever thought possible? Will he find true love within his new found freedom? As the player, the choices are yours to make... All the rewards as well as possible consequences, are yours to experience....<br/><br/><strong>Why did we make Illusion of Being?</strong><br/><br/>Illusion of Being was made to bring back the story telling that we crave while also bringing you some of the most intense visuals and emotions that a story like this can convey. It approaches difficult subjects on many different levels from substance abuse, adultery, friendship, betrayal, lust, fantasy, and much more! The game highlights elements that we believe have not been explored before in a detailed adult visual novel. It is grounded, real, immersive, heart breaking, inspiring.... With some of the best animations and characterization within the genre to accompany the tale. We aimed to create something both thought provoking, emotional, and yet thrilling to experience.
