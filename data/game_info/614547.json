As a result, SIS organized a small Game Jam with our employees and local post-secondary students to develop video games around the theme of \"Canoe Race\". In 48 hours, three teams of Snowmies and students successfully developed a trio of charming games that have brought CLK's long-running tradition to a new medium in style!</p>\r\nt h e\u00a0 \u00a0g o a l\r\n<p>This page has been put together to share the fruits of our game jam labours and to provide an opportunity for anyone enjoying these games to donate to CLK's great cause.
