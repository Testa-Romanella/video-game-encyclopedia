Her goal is to reach the top of a mountain in a small island to find the golden cricket and prove leopard geckos are great climbers too.</p>\n<p>While exploring the island Nebs can also collect normal crickets. Can she find them all?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD: move</li><li>Space: jump</li><li>Hold Tab: free camera</li><li><em>Controllers haven't been tested</em></li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Once you're on top of a mushroom hit Space to jump again to get a really good bounce!\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Wholesome Games Jam. The theme was <em>Don't Give Up\u00a0</em>so we decided to make a game about a leopard gecko because they love climbing even though they may not be the best at it. They definitely try their best!</p>\n<p>We also wanted to go for a very nostalgic vibe so this game has an option for a retro filter which you can turn on or off in the settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Team:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Akselmo - programming/level design</p>\n<p>Tecsiederp - art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:27:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48d/48d67e3ae010be63c007347cd22da3f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tecsiederp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
