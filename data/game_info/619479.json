You are in space and you have to find parts to join with yourself.<br/>Go to markers to gather more parts. They hang on big squares, drag a smaller square with mouse and attach it to yourself. Some parts have brown squares, those are thrusters and will make you go faster. On the other hand, if you have a lot of grays you will be very slow.</p>\n<p>Watch out for flying asteroids, they will destroy any part on impact. If they hit you (white square) you will die and game will restart.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to joind as many parts as you can and fly into the black hole, it is marked with purple marker (the one that's a bit further that other markers)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:54:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bca/bca8083d9c5668d636563499ec37801a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["makscee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
