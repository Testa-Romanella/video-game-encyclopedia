It is said that here is where the Champions live and where only them can return.<br/>The Order of Klepsydria, or Order of Champions, is as old as time itself. There has always been a guard at protection of the flow of time, but only few in the whole universe know about its existence. Becoming a Champion is the greatest honor and the destiny of a selected few allowed from the highest members of the Order itself.<br/><br/><strong>The Power of Champions:</strong><br/>All Champions have incredible skills: they have access to advanced technology as well as arcane ancient knowledge, both at the same time advanced and unattainable for anyone in the universe.<br/>Since they cannot be killed, Champions have forgotten the fear for death<br/>Finally, Champions have the ultimate power: the Leap. Thanks to the this incredible skill, all Champions can reach any place, in time and space and doing so, they are even able to escape death.<br/><br/><strong>The Final Goal of the First Order:</strong><br/>All this power is put at service of the protection of the Flow of Time, due to that, Champions are fighting a war since the very beginning of time. An eternal war which is also as old as time.<br/>When the First Order of the Champions was born, it has been decided to protect the flowing of time without any interference or deviation, without affecting its course in any possible way.<br/><br/><strong>The origin of the Eternal Conflict</strong><br/>Unfortunately, part of that First Order disagreed with the means of the mission.<br/>Some elder members of the First Order of Champions considered time as a flow that could be diverted and sometimes even stopped. Therefore, the Council split in 2 opposite factions: on one side there was the Alphas, committed to the first principle, so observing and protecting with no interference; on the other side, the Omegas, intentioned to stem and divert the flowing of events depending on what the Order thought it was best for the greater good of the Universe.<br/>The tension between the two factions keep rising until it reaches a point of no return and the Omega faction decided to initiate a war to annihilate the Alpha and challenge the Flow of Time itself. Their intention was to manipulate the very course of the \u201cRiver of Time\u201d.<br/>But manipulating that flow could bring to consequences that could be understood clearly by only those who will prevail in the Eternal Conflict.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Mods</strong><br/><br/><strong>Deathmatch:</strong><br/>Take a Leap to reach the battlefield and defeat all the opposing Champions.
