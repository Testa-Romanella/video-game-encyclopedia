{"id": 92307, "slug": "bun-gun", "name": "Bun & Gun", "name_original": "Bun & Gun", "description": "Bun and Gun\r\nDetails\r\n<p>Bun and Gun is a high-speed run-and-gun platformer where you play as Bun E. Bazooka in an attempt to save the Jade Kingdom from the vile clutches of the surprisingly-vampiric turtle\u00a0Shelltopias Turtatory Von Turtula.</p>\n<p>It is also a Gameboy-style demake of Jazz Jackrabbit 1's shareware episode, made for the Demake Jam.</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Five levels, spread across three different environments</li><li>A decent-sized\u00a0helping of secrets, alternate\u00a0paths, and easter-eggs</li><li>Four different difficulty settings, ranging from the mildly-challenging easy mode to the maddeningly difficulty Turbo mode\u00a0(NOTE: I recommend saving Turbo mode for\u00a0<em>after</em> you've already beaten the game at least once, it borders on downright unfair otherwise).</li><li>A\u00a0score system to keep you coming back for more as you try to beat your high-score (NOTE: Game does not save your high score if you close it down, I didn't really have time for that. Make sure to write it down if you care about it!)</li><li>Forgiving lives mechanics:\u00a0When you run out of lives, you restart at the previous checkpoint and lose all your points instead of losing level progress. This even applies at the highest difficulty settings!</li><li>Unique ammo mechanics:\u00a0Ammo regenerates over time, and regenerates faster based on how many fire-rate upgrades you've collected. If you can't find any ammo, just wait, it'll come eventually! However, your ammo is capped by how many Large Ammo pickups you've collected throughout the game, so you still have to be careful not to waste it!</li><li>A grand finale where you square off against the Vampiric Turtle himself, Shelltopias Turtatory Von Turtula! The boss battle changes significantly based on the difficulty setting you choose.</li></ul>\n\r\nQuestions and answers:\r\n<p>Q: Can I\u00a0remap the controls?</p>\n<p>A: Sadly, no.</p>\n<p>Q: Why is the game so hard?</p>\n<p>A:\u00a0Because Jazz Jackrabbit 1 was hard, especially later on and on higher difficulty settings. I'm hoping the effectively unlimited lives and easy mode are enough that most players can at least beat the game.</p>\n<p>Q: Why is the main villain a vampire turtle?</p>\n<p>A: Because I thought it'd be an interesting change compared to the original game.</p>\n<p>Q: I found a bug, what should I\u00a0do?<br/></p>\n<p>A: Please report it ASAP. I don't plan on fixing any bugs until after the Jam ends, but once it's ended, I may fix some of the most important ones.</p>\n<p>Q: I don't like one of the levels, can you change it?</p>\n<p>A: Possibly. Let me know which section or sections you don't like, and I'll see what I\u00a0can do.</p><p>Q: I\u00a0don't like the final boss on hard mode!<br/></p><p>A: I didn't really have time to remove the collision damage in the second phase of the final boss, which only shows up on hard mode and above. If you don't like it, I may see about fixing it in a future build, but for now, it is the way it is. *shrugs*</p>\n<p>Q: Why is my question not listed here?</p>\n<p>A: Because I didn't think of it and nobody's asked me it yet. Feel free to suggest things to add to this!</p>\n\r\nLegal stuffs:\r\n<p>Since this game is a Jazz Jackrabbit demake, as per Epic Games' fanworks policy, I feel like it's best for me to include this notice\u00a0<em>juuust</em> to be on the safe side (even if I'm pretty sure I've avoided any direct Jazz Jackrabbit references in-game, the collectible sprites\u00a0are admittedly\u00a0<em>preeetty</em> similar to the originals, albeit a bit smaller and in 4 colors etc. etc.):<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Portions of the materials used are trademarks and/or copyrighted works of Epic Games, Inc.
