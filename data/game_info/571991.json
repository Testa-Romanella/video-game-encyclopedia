This basic dictionary is a prototype I designed as part of the low-effort jam in a few hours that lets you learn about different illnesses. Click on one of the diseases to cause the names of certain diseases to appear. Then, click on the name of one of the illnesses to get information on one of the diseases. Again, I know it doesn't\u00a0 have much, but it will at least provide you with decent information on two types of waterborne bacteria, two types of waterborne fungi, and two types of waterborne viruses. Hopefully, you learn something and this can be combined with my other prototype into a much better game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T04:18:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7da4669d4905216ad7cab6d0bd8b0836.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jus4Games"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
