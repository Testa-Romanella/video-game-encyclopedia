{"id": 816659, "slug": "youre-it", "name": "You're It !", "name_original": "You're It !", "description": "<p>\"You're It !\" is\u00a0 a first year class project made with a bunch of my friends at E-Art Sup Bordeaux. \u00a0It's a local, controllers only, 1v1 2d platformer where you have to chase and catch the other player before you're timer is up ! If you manage to do so, then their timer will start to go down and they will have to catch you to stop it reaching 0, and so on until someone's timer has reached 0.</p>\n<p>This project took us 3 month-ish, features 3 main level and like, what, 4 hidden level if you find the correct commands ? You probably won't. A shame really, they are really funny.</p>\n<p>It's cartoony and colored, flashy and childish, fast-paced and really really fun. I hope you do enjoy the game as much as we liked making it.</p>\n<p>/!\\IF YOU WISH TO PAY FOR THE GAME, bear in mind that I will be the only one to get money from this page. The others have their own page for the game if you'd like to donate to them !
