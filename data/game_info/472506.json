Your only choice was to save yourself in an escape pod.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Now you need to salvage the debris of your destroyed spaceship that is raining on the planet your escape pod crashed into and use it to build another portal.</em></p>\n<p>I put this together in a hurry, since I really wanted to finish this silly thing. I'll translate it into english later, but the poem is pretty much about an rye ear, and it was time it was cut down. That made him sad, and then he got angry.</p>\n<p>I reused some assets from that project since I made it with Unity, and thought it was kind of not bad looking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The instructions are in the game texts. There are five levels of three debris waves, with\u00a0some abilities you pick up along the way to spice up the gameplay.\u00a0Anyway, I hope you enjoy the game. </p>\n<p>Sound effects obtained from\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:50:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff8a5d0a296f4cda8a08db101a56cc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dizztal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
