All code and assets are original and were made during this time.</p>\n<p>You play as a cybermage, exploring various sites, dodging obstacles and fighting enemies in order to connect each world to their home base.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys to move, space to jump, up to interact with doors. Additional controls in game instructions.</p>\n<p>Updates: For now all updates to the game will be purely bugfixes if there are softlocks or other major issues, as I want to keep the bulk of the work within the original 24 hours. Currently on version 0.0.3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:09:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2ca85f4c064195512166701109ec73e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mikronaut"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
