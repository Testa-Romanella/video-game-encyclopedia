After waking up on a strange world without any recollection of your past, you must explore, fight, and survive in order to rediscover your memories and find out why, and by whom they were taken away. You will progress through the game with a companion and acquire stronger items, weapons, and armor, these will boost different stats to allow you to combat enemies easier and faster. You will rediscover the characters lost memories by eliminating key enemies or bosses.<br/><br/>This is the roadmap for the game showing the goals for the major updates I have planned. <br/>This roadmap may change over the development process.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T03:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/515/515cf3c75204f3e4cf7a313cd17acafc.jpeg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/Playdek", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 385, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Playdek", "lamp.dog", "Split World Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Card", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Playdek", "lamp.dog", "Split World Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
