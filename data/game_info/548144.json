To make matters worse the frontier town is in no shape to provide support, so our adventurer ends up helping repair the town in exchange for better equipment to take on the frontier.<br/><br/><br/>Listen to the requests of the townsfolk before journeying out into the frontier, figuring out monster\u2019s weaknesses in turn-based combat and collecting materials to help restore the town and ultimately uncover the mystery of the artifacts. <br/><br/>Using the right equipment is key in progressing through the dangerous frontier. By choosing the right weapons, armor, gear and allies, you\u2019ll be able to make short work of the monsters blocking your path.<br/><br/>Through completing quests for the townsfolk, you'll be rewarded with new equipment that you\u2019ll need to succeed on your adventure, and as you complete quests and get to know the townsfolk, you'll be able to help them better themselves and grow the tiny village into a prosperous town. You might even learn more about the frontier\u2019s past and its inhabitants along the way too!<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Turn-based combat with puzzle elements</strong> that focuses on choosing the right equipment for the job<br/></li><li> <strong>Vibrant 2D art</strong> set within a colourful fantasy world<br/></li><li> <strong>A cast of quirky characters </strong>to meet and become acquainted with through <strong>30+ quests</strong><br/></li><li> <strong>50+ roads</strong> across many different environments to explore<br/></li><li> Watch the town slowly improve and expand as you complete quests <br/></li><li> A variety of different gear to collect and equip</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T03:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a0614a8ba18cfebf36a5db5987f92e81.jpg", "website": "https://stellaradvent.com/frontierquest/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stellar Advent Pty"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stellar Advent Pty"], "esrb_rating": null}
