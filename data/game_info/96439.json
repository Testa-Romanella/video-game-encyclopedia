And now I'm giving it to you for free :)</p><p>It's an experiment of sorts. There is one game mode. A challenge with a reward at the end. Don't expect it to be easy, because it's not. It'll take some dedication to beat. And for all the years this game has been available no one has ever beaten it as far as I'm aware. Will you be the first to unlock its secrets?<br/></p><p>26 gates block your path.</p>\n<p>How far will you get?</p>\n<p>Do you have what it takes?</p>\r\nHow to Play<p>(For the best experience I'd play with a gamepad)</p><p>You play Box, and as Box you eat Bytes. The bytes come in 3 colors. Red, Green, and Blue. In order to eat them you must change Box between the 3 colors to eat the matching Byte. If you run into a Byte that's a different color you'll lose a life.\u00a0</p><p>That's it. Simple. But it's much harder to master than it sounds. <br/></p>\r\n\r\n\tLinks<p>If you like my game, send me a message on twitter. </p><p>https://twitter.com/zaywolfe<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7ef677692b08c92a2bf5c280c621fea9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["zaywolfe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
