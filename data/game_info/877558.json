This was a project I created to test my skillsets as a beginner. My overall goal is to receive positive/negative/constructive feedback from the community. I looked to\u00a0create a challenging platformer that is designed to be played at a fast pace. This platformer has 16 levels where you are required to grab a key to unlock the door to the next level. You are given 10 seconds to complete each level and the further you get, the more challenging the levels become.\u00a0You move with WASD or Arrow Keys and jump with Spacebar. It is also gamepad compatible. All of the pixel art was created by me. Considering the size of the game, its really just a Demo. If I were to keep working on it, I would add more levels and increase the amount of complexity to the platformer via hazards and mechanics.\u00a0Thank you for trying my game, I would appreciate if you dropped a comment below on what I can improve on.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T15:25:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bf/6bfc5d841f541289a89ece31ac01b599.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["93Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
