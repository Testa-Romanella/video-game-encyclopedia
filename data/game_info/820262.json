Enemies are constantly \"rolling\", and will become dice bombs that have different effects depending on the rolled result. Fight through four, six, and eight sided dice enemies while opening gates to reach the green goal. Use the WASD keys to control your character and the mouse to aim and shoot. Try to finish levels as fast as possible! Your time will be listed.</p>\n\n<p>The effects of dice rolls\u00a0are here:</p>\n<p>1 - Creates a large explosion.</p>\n<p>2 - Shoots 2 bouncing bullets.</p>\n<p>3 - Creates a spinning bullet barrier that blocks your path.</p>\n<p>4 - Shoots 4 bullets that home in on you if you get close.</p>\n<p>5 - Creates 5 stationary and long-lasting bullets of differing sizes.</p>\n<p>6 - Creates 6 orbiting shots that spin outwards.</p>\n<p>7 - Creates a spread shot of 7 bullets aimed towards you.</p>\n<p>8 - Creates a 4-sided dice enemy.</p><p>Thank you to VGComposer for the music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T23:46:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3f/e3f6a9d4bcc3bc8cc5842a913385991d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ThatANonoWord"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
