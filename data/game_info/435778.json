If you have a unit selected that gets eaten, it breaks the mouse control code with a null reference. Try to always deselect when you're done moving a unit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T14:43:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bb/3bb3dc43ea8444ccac5c7c64752d3358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["welby"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
