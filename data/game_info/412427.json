In this game, player takes turns attacking and defending in a tower-defense style situation. During the defense turn player faces the troops that one organized in previous offense stage.\u00a0 In offense turn player faces the formation of one\u2019s own army from the stage before. In addition to this, we added a sense of puzzle game experience by providing an alternate goal in play : seeking not only the victory of the battle, but also the actual death counts made - both sides combined! - during the battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>Defense round - Click on the unit on the down right side to select, then click on the tile of the map to place them. You can deselect the unit by right click, and remove placed unit by right clicking them.</p>\n<p>Offense round - Click on the starting point of the lane to pop up the queue of the lane. While the pop up is on, you can click on the unit to put them on queue, and also add delay in queue by selecting the blank unit button. The pop up can be closed by clicking the up-right button on the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each unit has cost, and player can only buy units within the soul coin one has (the soul coin is shown up-right side of the screen, with a cute ghost icon!).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>\n<p>Each round, the amount of souls ( = deaths ) to be made is shown at the up-right UI of the game screen (marked with flag icon). Player must</p>\n<p>1. Achieve deaths in range of the given soul level</p>\n<p>2. At least one unit reaching the end (Offense) OR let no unit reach the end (Defense)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T05:20:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96ba7f221dc301126abf46cdf1d94a21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Connor-Wapi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
