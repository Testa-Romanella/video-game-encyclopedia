I've been reflecting upon Exodus in the past week (what with Pesach &amp; all), and had an idea for a 300-word game based on an interaction between Moses and Pharaoh.</p><p>Apparently, I have more to explore as concerns Pharaoh. I cut it down to 599 words (300 or 299 words, depending on which Choice you make), but realized that isn't quite cricket for this Jam.</p><p>I left Pharaoh where he belongs, in Mizrayim, and opened my mind to new possibilities. Starting out from narrow places.</p><p>I watched some ARROW, ate some matzoh, and mulled over what else I could write. Around 11.30pm, I hit on the idea, and wrote the first 127 words before turning in for the night.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a92/a92057d9e8a95859050b4b733572cca1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ValorsMinion"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
