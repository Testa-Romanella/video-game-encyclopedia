So as of writing this there is no Sound like at all. I did my best with what i could do and I am fairly happy with the product since it was my first time with Godot. Please click on INFO to see how to play.</p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY:</p>\n<p>You are Kasper, An Anti-Virus who defends the A Memory Chip from Virus at the same time protecting the Good Apps</p>\n<p>USE Arrow Keys for movement and Press Z for Shooting Laser</p>\n<p>GOAL:</p>\r\nProtect the memory as long as you can.<br/>Good apps Spawn randomly in random location, go and search for them and pick up up (Touch em).<br/>Don\u2019t let good apps stay out for too long as it will get corrupted.<br/>Don\u2019t Kill Good App, This will also corrupt the memory.\r\n<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>\n<p>At first i wanted to add more features and other gameplay elements but due to lack of experience with godot. I ended up with this.I wanted to abandon the project but I didn\u2019t wanna quit LD42 so Hope you guys Enjoy. I am quite happy with how it turned out but I wish i had more time to implement some basic features like high score, Sounds effects and Improve Graphics</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9b/e9b9fa4a6eb2e5735adf52fae7ef7e79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alien"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
