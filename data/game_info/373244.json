I would love to push the art style more towards what ZAMN was similar to; we will most likely see this happen at some point in one of the future episodes.</p>\n<p>There is various guns and items out in the game world. There is an objective you can find that will lead to you successfully escaping. As you survive and find out where more items are you will have greater success. Choke points are key.\u00a0 If it's too hard make sure you have the latest version and try it with the character from episode 2 (selectable from menu) He has more health and starts with an AK.</p>\n<p>The game is free, but I have 3 children at 1, 2, 5 yrs old, so any amount of money at all goes a long way.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for Episode Two and updates to Episode One.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(The game has only been played by myself; so let me know of any errors you find, audio improvements coming soon)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T07:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ad/9ad8d92432f1a2f0c6dc481323cb12f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Mysterious Journey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
