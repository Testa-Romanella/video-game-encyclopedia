{"id": 177434, "slug": "scarcity-2", "name": "Scarcity.", "name_original": "Scarcity.", "description": "<p>Scarcity. appeals to the theme because it shows a lot of scarcity. For starters there is no health regeneration and so theres a scarcity of health. Theres also a scarcity of sound and music as a way to show how void the character is. Even the character looks scarce because theres no real texture on it just a white film. Theres also minimal details on the sprites to show scarcity and the map is pretty plain as well. Its pretty short and simple but staying alive and winning by killing the ruler is very difficult which makes it very fun and challenging. Not to mention the player looks really cool with his sword that eats the enemies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f18/f18d8eb7edb32a35dcb3979e9d977114.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SudoRMRF"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
