It is a nice setting to tell a story.\u00a0Even though there is a wide range of different ideas that can emerge from this basic mechanic, it is very difficult to turn them into nicely designed puzzles that the player can easily understand.</p>\n<p>I tried to create a minimalistic demo in case it creates some interest. This is by no means a vertical slice, just an experiment to see how it feels and plays.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you find this kind of a puzzle game interesting!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T13:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de8/de8bc2b450c7e399ef1edfcaef28c7ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anacierdem"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
