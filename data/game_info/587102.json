Can you\u00a0prove to Baldi that your better at math than your opponent by correctly solving more math questions and by putting your opponent in detention?</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>When you start a level, an intro sequence will play. After it has finished, the main gameplay will start. Near the top of the screen you can see how many lives you and your opponent have left. To push them into the detention on their side of the room, you have to solve the math question on the bottom of the screen correctly when it's ready. There is a cooldown between answering math questions. After beating an opponent, you earn YTPs, which are used to unlock the next week. To complete a week, you have to beat all opponents in that week.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Micah McGonigal - Created Baldi's Basics</p>\n<p>Inspired By Friday Night Funkin'</p>\n<p>OofyOofOof - Created Clocker Character</p>\n<p>Badrum55 - Created Tomnado Character</p>\n<p>WowzaboiModder - Created Badsum Sprites</p>\n<p><em><strong>I hope you will enjoy playing this game, and new weeks will be added as updates are released!</strong></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T08:10:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfd/cfdf06789c253f7debc00b4bbe12fe47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["JohnsterSpaceGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
