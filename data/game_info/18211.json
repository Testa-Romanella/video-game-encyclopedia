Toko cannot ferry human souls to the underworld, and every day she stays on earth has her becoming increasingly human. Her troubles, however, are only just beginning. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nToko, after being taken in by the jubilant human Nadia, is being hunted by her past alongside her own internal challenges. The Reject Demon: Toko is about comedy, action, romance, and Hell\u2019s sacred art of Rock n\u2019 Roll! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOriginally conceived during a game jam in early 2014, \u2018The Reject Demon: Toko\u2019 has since exploded, and there\u2019s so much more of this universe to show you. Now we are planning to release the full story of the Toko Kinetic Visual Novel, over the course of 4 Chapters, starting with Chapter 0; it features much improved art, a much bigger cast, new scenes, and a whole new conclusion that doubles the length of the original story!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T12:38:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64a/64a7c119a4cf0f8bce77da2c4e7a8002.jpg", "website": "http://lupiesoft.com/the-reject-demon-toko/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 125, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lupiesoft"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lupiesoft"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
