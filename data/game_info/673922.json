I started this project when Vimlark released the Wizard Sprite 3 days ago.<br/></p>\n<p>The challenge I gave myself, is a one screen per level, small scale game.</p>\n<p>It is a small little action platformer, where you collect orbs, fight monsters, and I even through in a not so serious\u00a0boss at the end.\u00a0 It has a pause system, Menu system, Button configuration, audio volume controls, checkpoints, and more. I released both a HTML5, and EXE version. Supports controllers, and full screen (does not effect aspect, but has black bars.).</p>\n<p>Asset Credit for the ones I did not create:</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0<br/>https://vimlark.itch.io/vimlark-asset-pack\u00a0by\u00a0https://vimlark.itch.io</p>\n<p>Font:<br/>https://josemwarrior.itch.io/ultrapixel-font\u00a0by\u00a0https://josemwarrior.itch.io</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>https://dos88.itch.io/dos-88-music-library\u00a0by\u00a0https://dos88.itch.io</p>\n<p>Sound Effects:<br/>https://obsydianx.itch.io/interface-sfx-pack-1\u00a0by\u00a0https://obsydianx.itch.io</p>\n<p>Shaders:<br/>https://godotshaders.com/shader/god-rays/\u00a0by\u00a0pend00</p>\n<p>https://godotshaders.com/shader/hq4x-shader-like-in-emulators/\u00a0by\u00a0NekotoArts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T09:56:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a10/a10b63db494c55b0c4eb41a387984b8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Declivever"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
