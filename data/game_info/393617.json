(alpha)", "description": "<p>This is a simple game made my myself and a friend,\u00a0Dylan Telson, which we plan to complete after our semesters quiet down. The planned gameplay follows this frog trying to jetpack themselves into space, with different obstacles and jetpack related issues slowing them down.<br/><br/>Currently, the biggest part of the project implemented is the pseudo random generation of obstacle setpieces. We have a set of premade obstate sets which will spawn infinite in a random order, allowing us to customize different challenging sets while still keeping the game random and unpredictable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T02:30:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2f3122a3833bdb05fbfd9fd9f97a867.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pollux's Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
