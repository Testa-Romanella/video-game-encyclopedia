However, beware of the monster that will begin to be more and more aggressive and relentless as the player gets more points.</p>\n<p>This game was made by Lucas JOURDAN and Julien CASCALES.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD : Move</li><li>A/E : Rotate the mirror to the left/right</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T09:02:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/320f1cbe60bd263d91e66337654162f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zaaxos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
