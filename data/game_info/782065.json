You gain points by dragging raw meat off your pan. If you don't uncook the meat well, you lose a life, until you don't have any lives left. You get points based on how close you are to perfectly uncooking the meat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T22:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/461/461aabb7f03157c4bd4f1bfefa160568.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BrokOlieSoep"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
