And it worked! High Strategy: Oradros builds on that proof-of-concept with a larger world, a more dynamic set of actions, additional mechanics and interactions, and a better UI.<br/><br/>This is not a graphically intensive game, and you don't get to watch animated armies clash in glorious battle. Instead, you get a quick and steady stream of consequential decisions.<br/><br/>Here are some considerations you'll need to juggle:<br/><ul><li>All 40 playable realms start in different parts of the same map, with asymmetric starting conditions.<br/></li><li>Campaigns last hundreds of turns, and every realm has a unique set of cities it seeks to capture.<br/></li><li>You are not racing against the AI-controlled realms, and their reasoning is itemized in a way you can interact with.<br/></li><li>There are no arbitrary limits to how much you can expand, but even the largest realm still only gets one action per turn.<br/></li><li>A realm's capital cannot be moved, and any realm that loses its capital is immediately destroyed.<br/></li><li>Cities are surrounded by different terrains, which affect their economy, possible random events, and the ability of different armies to fight over them.<br/></li><li>The way battle works is stark: attacking and defending consumes soldiers like a currency. But there are systems for efficiency and surprise breakthroughs.<br/></li><li>Spying is an alternative or supplement to battle, and its success chance depends on the happiness of the locals.<br/></li><li>The kinds of military units available to you depend on who lives in your realm, as different cultures customarily fight in different styles.<br/></li><li>Most unit types gain experience through use, which unlocks upgrades. Units with more possible upgrades are weaker at the start, but stronger later on.<br/></li><li>There is no one-size-fits-all army composition, and changing your composition is easy. But any time you do so, you become temporarily vulnerable.<br/></li><li>Trade earns money, but the realm you're trading with earns just as much.<br/></li><li>You can quickly raise an army through conscription, but it consumes population.<br/></li><li>Almost all projects to enhance your cities are temporary and mutually exclusive.<br/></li><li>There are no AI bonuses: everybody plays by the same rules.<br/></li><li>A variety of random events will sometimes upset even the most well-laid plans.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-28T02:20:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/220/220c0dce4df2594de2ca7da5f62eb228.jpg", "website": "https://ironboarlabs.com/oradros/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iron Boar Labs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Iron Boar Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
