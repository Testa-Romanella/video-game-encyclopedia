Well, now you can give someone the joy of that experience. Virtually, anyway.</p>\n<p>Find the 3 buckets scattered across the map. Click on a food item to cut a hole in it, and the contents of the food (if any is left) will start pouring out. Collect the food-juice with buckets. When a bucket is full, place it in the white teleportation pod (\u00a0labeled with an arrow). If it is full, it will be beamed to your spaceship. Otherwise, nothing will happen, and you will need to fill it more.<br/></p>\n<p>Can you fill all three buckets and beam them to your ship?</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move.
