I made all the art, all the\u00a0animations and some of the code. Jos\u00e9 Felgueiras coded most of the code, though.</p>\n<p>With Gorilla Grip, we wanted to make a 3D platformer where you have to hold your controller like the character, in order to make it different and, in a way, more immersive. The game has some bug and glitches but be kind, as the game was done in a small amount of time!</p>\n<p>Control Gus through a construction site and be careful with the slimes! Jumping on top of them won't kill them, you have to use your own hands.</p>\n<p>Use a PS4 controller!</p>\n<ul><li>Left Joystick - Movement</li><li>X - Jump</li><li>R1, R2, R3, L1, L2 and L3 - Grab enemies and platforms (Looks hard but it's actually easy! Just hold down both Rs and Ls with the index and middle fingers\u00a0and press down the Joysticks with your thumbs!)</li></ul>\n\n<p>Known bugs and glitches:</p>\n<ul><li>Falling from a high place may make Gus go through colliders</li><li>When the ascending platforms move quickly, Gus may pass through it</li><li>Slimes' bodies sometimes glitch out</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T06:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84c/84cd99cfdbd7a666a872743641a3b585.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chavalo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
