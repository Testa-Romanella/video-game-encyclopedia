Plan your maze using the randomly generated world. Where you place the base and how you build your maze around it is a key part of this Tower Defense game!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Build your Maze:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Place your towers to create a maze for the enemies. But beware: There must always be a path for the enemies, but don't worry, the game makes sure you don't block the way. Use your Resources to Upgrade the Towers to increase their Power!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tower Effects:</strong></p>\n<p>Slow the enemies using a Frost Tower or deal massive damage with Splash damage using the Bomb Tower.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Alter the Terrain:</strong></p>\n<p>Just because the terrain is randomly generated doesn't mean you can't play god with it! But it will cost you! Remove Walls to create more room for towers or place/remove Water to create cheap detours for the enemies!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Build in:\u00a0</strong>Unity 2019</li><li><strong>Created by:\u00a0</strong>Timo Obst</li><li><strong>Time spent: </strong>~35 Hours\u00a0</li><li>This is my submission for the SFASX competition.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb7/cb700c933393e2a9454cf29650059eac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timo Obst"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
