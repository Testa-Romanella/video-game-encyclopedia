(RB)", "description": "<p>Who's Home is a horror game based around finding keys and proceeding to the next room, however, this isn't the first Who's Home, this is the rebuilt version of the original I made a year ago, now you might be thinking why would I remaster it instead of just working on the old one, well its because I lost the source code, or should I say deleted it on accident, after that I gave up on the idea, but a year later, with 5x better coding skills and a urge to build a game I began reverse engineering the original compiled game, and after about 10 hours work here I am with a already better version, well you might be saying \"10 hours, that's nothing\" and I know, but this 10 hours was spent getting what was left of the game into one piece, like a jigsaw puzzle, and now that is done, I plan to develop this game to what it was truly supposed to be.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>VERSION LOG</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LOG\u00a0 BEGINS AT 0.3.0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>0.3.0</strong></p>\n<p>MENU'S: Main Menu is now in a 3D environment, the version text doesn't just say unreleased now, it will change for every update made to the game, if your version isn't updated it will say, if you have no internet it will say (I'm proud), credits\u00a0</p>\n<p>GRAPHIC'S: Added film grain, lowered lighting even more, walls now have textures if you look close</p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY: Key now spawns in random places (8 different places currently in the first map), tutorial text appears on the first map, less buggy stairs (still cant go up them lmao), fixed the key going through the toilet, fixed some objects going through surfaces,\u00a0 fixed the player needing to press left mouse to drop things</p>\n<p>AUDIO: The soundtrack from the original game is now added</p>\n<p>MISC: New button above main menu lets you complete a form of questions that can progress game development (Please do it, it helps me)</p>\n\n<p><strong>0.4.0 (UNRELEASED/TO COME)</strong></p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY: Player needs to click door to finish level rather than magically vanishing into the main menu when they get close to the door, more than 1 level</p>\n<p>AUDIO: Random sounds will play with 3D directional audio that increases spookiness, new walking sounds (maybe?)</p>\n<p><strong>SUGGESTIONS: Not good enough for you? complete the Google form found in game and write me some suggestions and feedback</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Find the original here \u25bc<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T11:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/777/77777d630ec3928b864fea2c40537f35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ji9sw"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
