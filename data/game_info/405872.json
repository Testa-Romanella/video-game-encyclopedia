Collisions are also circular and slightly smaller than\r\nthe visual, so ideally these sprites will have some amount of transparency on\r\nthe border.</p>\n<p>Player and enemies will match the scale of the sprites you import. The default\r\nsize is 100x100 for player and 200x200 for enemies, but you can adjust the game\r\ndifficulty by using differently sized sprites.</p>\n<p>The textures will be tiled in the x- and y-axes.</p>\n<p>Icons will be squashed into a square shape, so square is your best bet.</p>\n<p>For animations (with ^.png), name each frame in sequence, starting with 0.</p>\n<p>In other words: 0.png, 1.png, 2.png for a 3-frame animation.</p>\n<p>Only .png format is supported.</p>\n<p>For example, the second frame of animation for the player shoot animation will\r\nbe the file: Shape Jam Shooter_Data/anim/player/walk/1.png</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T04:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea0a3e0d1e88b98bee44dccec2502f48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Joshua McLean"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
