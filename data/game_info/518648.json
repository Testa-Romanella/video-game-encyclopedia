It blends live-action and graphics to create a unique immersive horror experience like no other. You play Maya, a student trapped in a remote hotel run by a psychopath called Jimmy Hall.  Jimmy has tied up Maya's friends and locked them in their rooms, with evil intentions. Maya has managed to escape, but Jimmy is on the prowl looking for her. However, to get him to release her friends, Maya must uncover Jimmy's dark secret. Using an ancient ghost voice receiver she finds, Maya must communicate with the ghosts of Jimmy's past, who materialise around the hotel and gradually reveal their story.<br/><br/><strong>MAC VERSION &amp; ACHIEVEMENTS</strong><br/><br/>We're currently unable to release the game on Mac, but we're trying to get this version working asap. For now the game will only be available for Windows.<br/><br/>Also currently Steam achievements don't work, though you will still see in-game achievements. Again, this is something we're working on and hope to fix as soon as we can.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T03:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85a7826b32a5c162145de8804540eec5.jpg", "website": "https://baggycat.com", "rating": 4.38, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 42, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baggy Cat"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Baggy Cat"], "esrb_rating": null}
