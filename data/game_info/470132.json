Because you lack control of the item dispenser hahaha</p>\n<strong>So how do we craft\u00a0them?</strong>\n<p>It's pretty simple. Pick up items with 'Space', use item with the combiner machine with the 'F' key. When you have the right items inside you can then <strong>press \"E\"</strong> to turn the machine on. Now you have the product done! We just need to deliver it.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>To deliver a product, just <strong>press \"F\" key</strong> near the deliver bench\u00a0to deposit it. Each correct delivery\u00a0\u00a0add points to your score.</p>\n\n<p>Now you are ready to go and test out game concept. Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>We aim to improve art, fix bugs and expand the game later :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T07:16:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b3/8b31ece6654bcbaf2e6cfa65298c1371.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas Campos", "MatheusSturm", "Cirbble"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
