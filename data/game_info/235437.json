You start the game with 50 coins. Depending on how good your show is, people will show up to watch. People who stay without leaving will pay you for the show at the end of it. There's a bit of strategy involved though.....the crowd likes a variety of fireworks and they like it when air fireworks pop high in the sky. The higher an air firework gets popped, the higher chance of attracting more people. Ground fireworks can attract a few people as well. <br/>If an air firework pops too low, some people will get scared and leave! If the same firework continues to go off some people may get bored and leave. A few people might also leave your show if you launch an air firework and let it go off screen without popping it. So make sure your show is entertaining! <br/><br/>Watch a Show: In this mode you can manually select up to ten fireworks to sit back and watch go off endlessly in a fireworks show. You can also let the app randomly choose ten fireworks to use in this show if you don't want to pick them out. You don't need to use coins for either option. <br/><br/><br/>\u221a Over 100 different and awesome fireworks! <br/>\u221a Create your own show or watch an endless one! <br/>\u221a Real firework sound effects! <br/>\u221a Game Center leaderboard &amp; 20 achievements! <br/>\u221a Various big and unique particle effects! <br/>\u221a Safe fun for all ages! <br/><br/>Have a blast with Fireworks Showeator!!<br/><br/>8-Bit Avrin Apps", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703bae3b6257936ca133c4fbd668d2e5.jpg", "website": "http://www.8BitAvrin.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Avrin Ross"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Avrin Ross"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
