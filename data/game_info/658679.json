It is inspired by the famicase design from @Yowaimori though the gameplay differs from the famicase description.</p>\n\n<p>I liked the visual idea of the over/under nature of the lines and wanted some gameplay to create knot like forms. My first thought was the old Rubik's Tangle puzzle from many years ago.</p>\n\n<p>But also mixed with the old Pipe Mania game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:\u00a0</strong>Place connecting ribbon sections from the starting knot. Once the time runs out your connecting sections will begin to turn red. If the red reaches the end of your ribbon the game is over. The idea is to score as high as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T09:17:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf2/bf2fccb446f545284e6888370df2ce16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["David Williamson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
