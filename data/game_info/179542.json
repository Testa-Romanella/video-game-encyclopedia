I composed its unique sound and music effects by making live foley recordings. Notes were created using a glockenspiel, kalimba, and guitar, all instruments I don\u2019t actually know how to play.</p>\n<p>The two most requested features at the moment are: Special Abilities\u00a0(these could either manifest themselves as classes or powerups)\u00a0 and Online Play (like an IO game). Both of these requests\u00a0would be interesting\u00a0 to pursue but I would like to see how big the demand really is. If you decide to purchase this game, please let me know what direction you want me to develop. You are my audience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d7/8d71ffdbf36c9bece5a679b5ed7a0285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Artfail"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
