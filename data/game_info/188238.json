ZOMBIES ARE EVERYWHERE!</p>\n<p>But as Patient 0 of the zombie virus, your infection, which is not as evolved as the current infection, can be reduced through acts of ultimate violence (relieving stress and what not). This makes you the perfect candidate to kill all the zombies! Can't rot whats already rotten.</p>\n<p>Fly around the level as you kill any zombies in sight. You'll need to focus to shoot, but focusing will cause the infection to spread, so kill some zombies to keep it at bay. Getting hit by zombies will also increase the infection, so keep moving!</p>\n<p>Whats this? The zombies have evolved a way to amalgamate? They'll combine with each other to form bigger and stronger zombies?!</p>\n<p>Well, Good Luck</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/005/005f8eaf916f0e98c72d7e939d0b0680.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Random Thoughts"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
