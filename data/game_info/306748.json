You both take 10 steps, turn and reach for your pistols. Are you quicker than your opponent?</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>The numbers 1 to 10 are printed on the screen to represent the 10 steps. When \"Draw\" is printed on the screen, you must press the Space key instantly. If you are quicker than your opponent, you will win. Don't press the Space key before \"Draw\" is displayed, or you will automatically lose.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>I created this simple game to get familiar with Lua and L\u00f6ve2D as a game development framework. I wanted to create a trivial retro game with the feel of an old Basic game from the late 1980s. I hope you enjoy playing the game for a few minutes now and then.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T06:01:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/9347e119cb8134492bd5fdb6abf37ddc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["jwigert"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
