But some platforms also have thorns, some do not hold the cube for more than a few seconds, and some move it in different directions.<br/>\r\nThus, you need to balance on the platforms for the maximum amount of time so that the cube stays in order.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T02:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea4/ea459a23e7b4f2e5c70d75663f7a031a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beans rolls"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["beans rolls"], "esrb_rating": null}
