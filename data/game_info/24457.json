Connect the pipes \n      alone or play cooperative with up to 4 friends!<br/>Heron: Steam \n      Machine is a game about a factory where rubber duckies are being \n      produced by a large steam engine. On this steam engine, there are four \n      different gauges which you will have to watch carefully. By connecting \n      the pipes, you will earn points and relieve some of the pressure, \n      keeping the machine running just a little bit longer! If one of the \n      gauges reaches its maximum, the machine will eventually blow up, and the \n      game is over. If you were lucky enough to achieve a high score, make \n      sure you enter your name in the list so other players can compete with \n      you! In Multiplayer, you are able to cooperate with friends in \n      maintaining the steam machine. When you play with two, three or four \n      players, the screen is divided into sections with different background \n      colors. Each player is able to solve his or her own part of the puzzle. \n      Players are restricted to their own section of the screen, so you will \n      have to work together to make the pipes fit properly!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b4/2b4379e0560637c556f293039767d00c.jpg", "website": "http://www.heronsteammachine.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Triangle Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
