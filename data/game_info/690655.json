The goal is to collect more candy than your opponent by approaching houses. You can attack your opponent with a \"trick\" that will make them drop candy that you can pick up.</p>\n<p>Compared to previous games, this one is only slightly updated. I attempted to get AI working so I\u00a0could at least have 4 players, but as of this writing it's not working out like I\u00a0hoped (I would say that programming AI is currently my weakness). Another issue I\u00a0ran into was trying to get multiple gamepads to work on a single machine. Currently, only player 1 can use a gamepad (NOTE: Up and down on the left stick\u00a0doesn't work correctly due to an issue in Unity 2020).</p>\n<p>Other than those 2 issues and some improvements to the UI and gameplay, the game is identical to the Flash version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:38:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0c/c0c8c1f81451e5f76cff7f9262bbece2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mike Murray"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
