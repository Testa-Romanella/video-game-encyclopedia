VECTROS, developed by Mars in an effort to wipe out the Earth alliance, has been turned to fight for the outnumbered and outgunned forces of Earth.  The irony is not lost on the allied Earth forces, who have reprogrammed &amp;quot;Cynthia,&amp;quot; its military droid pilot, to be the centerpoint of a sneak attack on the Martian headquarters.<br/><br/>Become &amp;quot;Cynthia,&amp;quot; and save the Earth!<br/><br/>[Developmental background]<br/>VECTROS and its weightless, high speed fights move through space in a wireframe battlefield, the vector scan graphics that entertained a different generation of gamers.  Then raster scan games went mainstream, polygons appeared, and vector scan games died out.  Development of VECTROS began with a psychological need to answer the question, \u201cWhat would happen if Vector Scan games never died out?\u201d <br/><br/>It&amp;#39;s a world like you&amp;#39;ve never seen, the outline of an intricate facility drawn with luminous TRON-like energy, hanging weightlessly in the perfect black of deep space.  The enemy headquarters will race around you as you battle your way towards its center.<br/><br/>Compatible: iPhone (3GS and above), iPad (iPad2 and above, including iPad mini), and iPod touch (The 4th generation and above).<br/>Compatible OS: iOS4.3 and above.<br/>Official site: http://vectros-w.ne-net.jp/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/058/0580498c404254b9e1935f995e60e7df.jpeg", "website": "http://world.ne-net.jp/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["nenet"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["moak-1 co"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
