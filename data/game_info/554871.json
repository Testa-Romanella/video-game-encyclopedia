He is not the strongest robot and if you continue to run into walls he will perish :(, but I know you won't let that happen to him (right?)!</p>\n<p>Using your robot controller you will have to turn on and off his directional buttons to guide Robo through the maze. A solid button is on and a hollow button is off.</p>\n<p>I wish you and Robo luck in your 7 level adventure.</p>\n\n<p>You will get 100% better performance by downloading this game. If you like the tutorial and the 4th level slows waaaaaay down. Go and download it instead. Sorry for the inconvenience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:16:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39a/39a679ec6f34879d45d24375e0bdd595.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Niyy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
