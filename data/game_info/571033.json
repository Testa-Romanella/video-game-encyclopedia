Do this by clicking the buttons labelled English and \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439.</p>\n<p>Then chose a level, currently you can play: the wild west, the dark forest, and in space! (castle and others coming soon!)</p>\r\nIn game\r\n<p>Once you start a level it will play endlessly until you exit. (alt f4) <br/>The game is controlled by successfully typing out the words you can see on screen using your keyboard </p>\n<p>Each time you complete all the words the scene will reload and the difficulty will increase.</p>\n<p>All feedback is welcome but I\u00a0would appreciate it if it stayed constructive :D\u00a0</p>\n\r\n Other bits\r\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: I have done my best to ensure that the English dictionary has no \"bad\" words in it, I cannot do this for the Russian language as I\u00a0am not yet fluent. Should you come across any in either language please leave a comment and I\u00a0will take it out</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:49:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/00193c64bb1e9e853c52b4a9563301ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CaptainSalt99"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
