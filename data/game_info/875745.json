The final release of this project will see many changes and a lot more content.</em><br/></p>\r\nIt Begins\r\n<p>Below is an excerpt from a found footage forum. The thread was created in January of 2002 and it received traffic until 2006 until it was abruptly locked and deleted by moderators of the site.<br/></p>\n<p>\"The file I've linked contains footage that was found on the body of an unnamed man who was located just outside the Chedoke falls drain in Hamilton, Ontario. On the tape, written in blue marker, was the message, 'For Unstoppable Jane'. Miraculously, the tape has survived despite intense weathering. <br/></p>\n<p>When watching the tape, you can hear the sound of a Tawny owl, which is an owl commonly found in Europe and Russia. There is also footage of documents and paperwork that is in English as well as footage of tree species native to Northern Europe.<br/></p>\n<p>Because of the owl calls, English paperwork, and tree species, I think the man was exploring a storm drainage system somewhere in central Britain. This has been hard to confirm though, as I've yet to find<em> any</em> drainage maps that match the layout from the tape. I'll keep looking and continue updating this thread. <br/></p>\n<p>Some of my friends have suggested that the man might have been filming inside of an abandoned Canadian research site somewhere in Eastern Russia, but, none of this has been confirmed by anything other than context clues.</p>\n<p>It also doesn't explain how the body was found in Hamilton. Creepy.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyways, if you think that you may have a lead on who 'Jane' is or if you think you know the location in the footage, please contact me and we can chat. Until then, I'll be active in the forums.\"</p>\n<p>Luckily, a few of the users on the forum kept chunks of this mystery on USB sticks and external hard drives. No one knows who the original poster on this forum was.\u00a0 It seems that these glimpses into the past are all that we are allowed to see regarding this internet mystery. When the footage was filmed is still unknown.  <br/></p>\r\nRoadmap &amp; Series\r\n<p>This will be the first game in a series that I would like to make. All of the games will be in a format that relies heavily on atmosphere and will attempt to limit the player in unique ways to enhance the tensity of the horror/exploration experience. All of the games will each try to mimic the aesthetics of different video recordings: camcorder footage, undersea drone footage, bodycam footage, etc.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>In the full release of this project, there will be some combat, much more to explore, and pieces of lore which can be read to put together a mysterious narrative which will carry over into each game in this series. The games will all be short and provide different perspectives/answers on the mystery. I am planning on releasing these games under the \"pay what you want\" model because I do not want money to be the main motivator behind the creation of artwork, even if the artwork is a silly little VHS horror game.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>If you would like to support me, follow my twitter to stay tuned -- I don't need your money, I need your love &lt;3\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you would like to give me feedback, please leave a comment. It's easier to see and organize if it's here. <br/></p>\n<p>Any and all engagement helps me want to make more things for people to enjoy! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T14:49:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e308b40ad3cad602a11ac0c569ab542.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["titolovesyou"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
