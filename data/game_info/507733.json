There were more mechanics I wanted to add (Money system for buying food, work life balance bar), but ultimately with the time and resources available, I decided to go with a purer experience than stretch it all to thin. I still wish I had gotten certain behaviors in like laying down in bed, but I hope the work still is enjoyable on its own merits and leaves room for the imagination.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:47:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cb/7cb8b2826a7559e639788ed17cd9407a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FINNJC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
