It's a very basic puzzle game that takes a linked image file, cuts it up into squares, and mixes them up. You can swap the pieces around by tapping and rotate pieces by double-tapping. This project was more code and platform practice than it was an attempt to make something really interesting with the technology.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:55:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f5ccded9c9807c7499e6d2a2e09e130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["incobalt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
