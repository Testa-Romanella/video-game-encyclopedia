Complete daily challenges,  simple daily and weekly evaluations and rate your partner's progress as  they rate and review your own. Simple and effective, both partners have an equal say.<br/><br/><strong>Purpose and Goals:</strong><br/><br/>\u2714\ufe0f To overcome difficulties in communication and understanding.<br/>\u2714\ufe0f To overcome marital disputes, arguing and tension.<br/>\u2714\ufe0f To become a better team and cooperative couple.<br/>\u2714\ufe0f To strengthen your bond, rekindle your friendship and intimacy.<br/><br/><strong>Expectations:</strong><br/><br/> \ud83c\udfc6 Progress is entirely up to each couple.<br/> \ud83c\udfc6 Love Boot Camp is a \"self help\" application, not a therapist.<br/> \ud83c\udfc6 You must stay committed and motivated to complete the process.<br/> \ud83c\udfc6 The both of you will encourage and mentor your own development.<br/> \ud83c\udfc6 Commitment is the process. Team work is the progress.<br/> \ud83c\udfc6 You both are the key to your success.<h3>\ud83c\udfc6 Daily Challenge:</h3><br/>During the Daily Challenge you are both given 3 goals to achieve each day. After the end of the day, each partner gives a quick assessment on how well the other partner achieved those goals. You both then review the results and end the day. Merit points are given to your partner based upon how well they achieved those goals. Merit Badges are also earned as you gain Merit Points. Results and progress are carried on to the next day and throughout the week. Each week, you are given 3 new goals to achieve daily for 4 weeks in total. The assessment and review only takes a few minutes each day and is very simple to complete. The development can also continue long after the 4 week goal is achieved. All progress can be saved and Weekly Coaching can be accessed to provide further details about your Daily Challenges.<br/><br/><h3>\ud83c\udfc6 Weekly Assessment:</h3><br/>At the end of seven days of your daily challenges, you and your partner will be given a weekly assessment. Each evaluation session is a few minutes. You and your partner each respond to a series of phrases through several response options. You then review each other\u2019s responses and then conclude the session with discussions or silent reflection. Each private session can last 5-15 minutes. The complete couple's session can last from 30 minutes to an hour. Once the weekly assessment is completed, a new week is started with new Daily Challenges and goals.<br/><br/><h3>\ud83c\udfc6 Time Involved:</h3><br/>Weekly assessments are simple but can grant amazing insight for both partners to reflect upon. You both can discuss the results or can opt to not discuss the results after they have been reviewed. The option to go over areas of concern is also available. No 3rd party is ever needed.<h3>\ud83c\udfc6 Merits and Rewards: </h3><br/>Merit Badges are earned through progress. Your partner\u2019s assessment of your progress determines the points earned and the badges you receive. You also in turn determine your partner\u2019s progress equally. Your perspective of your partner and your partner\u2019s perspective of you is what matters most here, not the accuracy of the assessment. This is what is reflected over time and inspires motivation on both sides. Accountability is also automatic and helps to keep your progress honest and fair without any 3rd party intervention.<h3>*Love Boot Camp is not a therapist nor is it created by licensed therapists. Developed by a couple of over 20 years of marriage, Love Boot Camp is a \"self help\" application designed to help guide couples into reflection, self development and cooperation. Progress and results are  based upon each couple's willingness to work together. We make no claims or guarantees for any personal success or prevention of failure.</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T05:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b41/b413095dfe24d5950872f49972428ce4.jpg", "website": "https://www.marriedbook.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["marriedbook"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["marriedbook"], "esrb_rating": null}
