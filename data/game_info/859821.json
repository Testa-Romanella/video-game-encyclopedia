{"id": 859821, "slug": "generations-for-playdate", "name": "Generations for Playdate", "name_original": "Generations for Playdate", "description": "Generations for Playdate\r\n<p>\r\nGenerations is a challenging puzzle game that has you organizing <em>Portraits</em> on the wall of a living room,  a task requiring a surprising amount of strategy, planning,  and thinking ahead. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nEach time you hang three (or more) <em>Portraits</em> of any family members of the same age group next to each other, the <em>Portraits</em> will combine into a new <em>Portrait</em> of an older family member.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe current <em>Portrait</em> is on the table to the left of the couch, and the <em>Next Portrait</em> rests on the middle of the couch. <em>Bonus Portraits</em> will appear on the table to the right of the couch. More on those in a bit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          The beginning of a new game.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe game begins with <em>Storks</em>. Three <em>Storks</em> combine into an <em>Infant</em>. Three <em>Infants</em> turn into a <em>Child</em>, and so on until you combine three <em>Portraits</em> of the matriarchs and patriarchs of the family. When this happens, you've created a <em>Generation</em>, and all <em>Portraits</em> you've hung on the wall will automatically age up and the spaces occupied by the elderly will open back up, ready for a new generation of descendants.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Three storks combine to make an infant.\r\n\r\n<p>\n<em>Portraits</em> can only be hung next to other <em>Portraits</em>, and you'll need to think ahead to optimize their placement in order to chain matches and not strand any. Once you've run out of space the game will end.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Chaining an infant to a child to a teenager.\r\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPress the <em>A Button</em> to place a <em>Portrait</em> on the wall. <em>Long Press</em> the <em>A Button</em> to store a <em>Portrait</em> for later on the table to the right of the couch if it is not already occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe <em>B Button</em> will <em>Undo</em> your most recent move. You may not <em>Undo</em> a move if that move resulted in a <em>Match</em>. You can also <em>Long Press</em> the <em>B Button</em> to <em>Pet The Cat</em> if he's on the couch or sitting on the window sill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Undoing a move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe <em>D-Pad</em> is used to navigate spots on the wall. Open spots have a single, light outline around them. The currently selected spot will animate up and down, and if it's open, will display four markers on the inside. Squares that are a solid gray cannot be played - to open these spots, there must be a <em>Portrait</em> hung next to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Navigating to an open spot on the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe <em>Crank</em> is used to switch between the current <em>Portrait</em> and the <em>Bonus Portrait</em>. Whenever you chain a match, you'll earn a <em>Bonus Portrait</em> that will appear on the right side of the couch if that table is not already occupied. This will either be a <em>Portrait</em> of the same value of the <em>Chain</em>, or could be a <em>Special</em>. More on those later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n          A diagram of what everything in the game is.\r\n\r\nMaking a Match\r\n<p>\r\nTo make a match, select an open spot that has at least two other <em>Portraits</em> of the same age group adjacent to each other. <em>Portraits</em> touching on any side are considered adjacent. <em>Gender does not matter.</em>\n</p>\r\nCombinations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree or more <em>Storks</em> combine into an <em>Infant</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree or more <em>Infants</em> combine into a <em>Child</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree or more <em>Children</em> combine into a <em>Teen</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree or more <em>Teens</em> combine into an <em>Adult</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree or more <em>Adults</em> combine into a <em>Senior</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree or more <em>Seniors</em> create a <em>Generation</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChaining a Match\r\n<p>\r\nTo <em>Chain</em> a <em>Match</em>, you must be strategic about your <em>Portrait</em> placement. You'll need to complete a match that results in a <em>Portrait</em> that matches two or more existing <em>Portraits</em> on the wall. Each time you succeed in chaining a match, you'll gain a <em>Bonus Portrait</em> so long as the table to the right of the couch isn't already occupied.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Chaining a match.\r\n\r\nCreating a Generation\r\n<p>\r\nTo create a <em>Generation</em>, you must combine three or more <em>Seniors</em>. When this happens, all <em>Seniors</em> on the board are removed from play and every <em>Portrait</em> currently on the wall ages up a level. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Creating a Generation.\r\n\r\nSpecials\r\n<p>\r\nWhenever you <em>Chain a Match</em> and are awarded a <em>Bonus</em> there is a small chance that you'll get a <em>Special</em>. There are two different types of specials, and they are played on existing <em>Portraits</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA <em>Plus Heart</em> will <em>age up</em> any <em>Portrait</em> it is played on. They cannot be played on <em>Seniors</em>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Using a Plus Heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA <em>Minus Heart</em> will <em>remove</em> any <em>Portrait</em> it is played on from the board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Using a Minus Heart.\r\n\r\nGame Over\r\n<p>\r\nThe game ends when there are no more available spots on the wall to hang a <em>Portrait</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          Game over.\r\n\r\nSystem Menu\r\n<p>\r\nWhile in-game, there are two options in the <em>System Menu</em>\n</p><ul>\n<li><em>Restart Game</em> will - you guessed it - restart your current game.</li>\n<li><em>Main Menu</em> will save your game and return you to to the front door. Your progress is also saved when you exit the game and will be ready for you the next time you play.</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nThe Main Menu\r\n<p>\r\nFrom here you can <em>Start a New Game</em> or <em>Continue a Game</em> that's already in progress, see the <em>Top Five Local High Scores</em>, access <em>Game Options</em>, and view your <em>Lifetime Stats</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n          \r\n          The main menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n      How to Install the Game\r\n      <p>\r\n      Not sure how to sideload games onto your Playdate?
