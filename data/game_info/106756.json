You will wake up in a strange place with only a few tools at your disposal.  With those tools, you will slowly unravel the riddles that seem to be all around you.  Length is something like an hour or two.</p><p>Press space to jump, hold space to fly.  Flying works best done in short, controlled bursts.  If you are facing straight up, down, left, or right you make make a 180-degree turn.</p><p>Press X to pick up weapons (the blinky yellow flowers), hold X to fire.</p><p>Press R if you get stuck in a wall/thrown off screen.</p><p>Have fun!
