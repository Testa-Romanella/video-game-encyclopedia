Multiple worlds, levels and aliens are waiting to be blasted.<br/><br/>Our focus is on using your thumb like the 80&amp;#39;s and 90&amp;#39;s shooter games:  The faster your thumb, the faster you shoot !!  Give the controls a few minutes to get used to, they really work!<br/><br/>Hidden worlds, different difficulty modes (un-lockable pilots)  AWESOME sound track and great retro graphics and sound effects.<br/><br/>Game starts in easy mode, but Hard mode is as challenging as all our games are, getting the full 100% completion is not for the weak or casual gamer!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/986/986fecbe247cfdbc1972f7a436146aca.jpg", "website": "http://orangepixel.net/neoteria", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Orangepixel", "Pascal Bestebroer"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Pascal Bestebroer"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
