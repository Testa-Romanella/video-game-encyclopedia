The environment could turn to a bleak, washed-out room, or a colourful, unfamiliar reality. You will be accompanied by me, as I discuss my thoughts about reality, life and balance, while you lead the direction of the narrative.</p>\r\nControl's\r\n<ul><li>Mouse - Look Around</li><li>WASD - Move</li><li>E - Interact</li></ul>\r\nDeveloper's Note\r\n<p>This project is an experimental experience, taking inspiration from The Beginner's Guide. I developed this solo project within two and a half weeks for a brief at SAE. During development, the projects focus shifted from an all-out crazy environment to a more chilled out experience, where I can discuss my thoughts about life, based on personal experiences. It's rough around the edges, but the focus here is on the narrative and it is time to move on to the next project.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17a/17a11f21f18299d9afea8a218b3ab17f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Callum Nottage"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
