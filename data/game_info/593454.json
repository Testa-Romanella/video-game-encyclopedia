It MAY work, but I\u00a0can guarantee 110% functionality of the Windows version. I created my own engine mods to bring this project to life, as it's been a passion project that I've left on the backburner for quite a while. The file size is a bit large, but that's because the actual game (not accessed in this particular demo) is already a few hours long, and has over 150 rooms!...it isn't quite finished yet, though. Please follow @ghostscreen.studios on Instagram for development updates!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T05:08:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bd/8bd6db39f7df5afe9ef085fc7a3a5221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ghostscreen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
