Absorb dirt particles to power your weapon. If you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll run out of the ground beneath your feet and fall to your death. The corpses of enemies will leave behind extra dirt, which can be a curse\u2013if you let it build up too high up, you\u2019ll have less time to react to the flying enemies and their projectiles. But, usually you\u2019ll be rationing your dirt and timing your shots to eliminate multiple enemies at a time.
