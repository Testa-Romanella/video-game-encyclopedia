What is special about this guy is that he really looks like a girl. And this is because Serika holds the soul of an ancient goddess who is also known as The Slayer of God. As a result of this, Serika has a so-called immortal body that doesn&#39;t get old. However, this goddess &quot;side&quot; is starting to become dominant of Serika&#39;s body and hence Serika&#39;s female-like appearance.</p>\n<p>The story is basically about Serika and his servant going to a kingdom where Serika is asked by a friend of his to investigate the disappearance of the Royalty, mainly the Princess. This is how the story starts, but later in the game things will start to get complicated where religious cults, demons, angels, and goddesses will start to get involved in the story.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T15:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f9/8f9c17051ce402ca16cf3e4e095a90c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
