It is inspired by Implied Gallery, The Zium Garden, Alien Caseno and underground rave scene. If you think toilet sucks, you shouldn't play this game.\u00a0You are allowed to get into this space only after 4am, because losers are still awake at that time. You are not allowed to bring friends with you. WHY? Cuz you suck. You got 0 friend.\u00a0You are the only person/alien (whatever I don't really care) in this world. Other than that you\u00a0can do whatever you want.\u00a0Go explore, get lost,\u00a0be confused,\u00a0do wired shit, cry or laugh.\u00a0It's completely safe here.\u00a0This game is still developing. More space will be created for you to explore.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T08:42:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71cdd866a8debfbfa1225269898e7953.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Leaky Jarrrr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
