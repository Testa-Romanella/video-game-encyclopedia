You can explore everything!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This thrilling game brings to life many things people wished for, superpowers and exploration. I have been waiting years for someone to create a game like this, too long. I have decided to create this myself because I want people to share the same vision I do, an amazing exploration game!</p>\n<p>I have many planned features, unfortunately I am a one man team, so it may take me quite some time. Please stay with me as I develop this game. I hope to give players a great experience they will never forget.</p>\n<p>Currently there is no main object, just explore and see what the game is about, I hope you all enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c2/4c29d77d5f517940245573c04b68aba4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Stone Helm Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
