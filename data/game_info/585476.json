A traditional rpg made purely for fun!\r\nJoin Marq in his wacky adventure where lots of random stuff happens as he finds new people that joins his party!</strong></p>\n<p>This game it's an earthbound fangame(kind of). I really like earthbound so i wanted to make a game like earthbound with my characters just for fun. Also it's supposed to be kinda goofy, so don't take everything toooooo seriously.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Every enemy has its own battle music (kinda)\r\n</p>\n<p>Turn-based battles\r\n</p>\n<p>GRINDING? LEVELS? WHAT'S THAT? That's right, there are no levels in the game, so intead of overlevelling yourself to win, you have to rely on strategy.\r\n</p>\n<p>You unlock new skills by defeating special bosses! (there are none in the demo,though)\r\n</p>\n<p>A soundtrack made of Mother 3 and some Pok\u00e9mon music,except that they've been remade with updated instruments!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Tileset Add-ons: Avery\r\n</p>\n<p>Item Icons: Avery\r\n</p>\n<p>Enemies: \u00c6kashics\r\n</p>\n<p>Damage numbers: KaelCat\r\n</p>\n<p>Battle backgrounds: They're from mother 3 too lol\r\n</p>\n<p>Dialogue Box Character Icons: Made by my dear friend SpookySat!\r\n</p>\n<p>Main Characters: Made by me :D\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Estimated Release Date: June 2021 or earlier</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>You should also check out the gamejolt page!</em></p>\n<p>https://gamejolt.com/games/dthunt/593197</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T09:20:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/222/222efa03b205e10ac361084235a1b245.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nebulaphile"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
