Denman Jr. and released in 1981 by Med Systems (later known as Screenplay) of Chapel Hill, North Carolina for the TRS-80 computer. It combines a text adventure with simple line graphics to create a first-person perspective 3D game. Med Systems had earlier released games like Rat's Revenge, Deathmaze 5000, and Labyrinth with the same kind of graphics; these games were among the earliest commercial examples of 3D games.</p>\n<p>A sequel named Asylum II was released in 1982. The sequel was later enhanced with bitmapped graphics, color, and improved descriptions, and released simply as Asylum in 1985 for the Commodore 64. There were also editions for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers and the IBM Personal Computer coded by Warren Zunino.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1981-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/734/734bc83a0c149e651902c1283e5630f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["William F.
