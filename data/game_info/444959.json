It is a beautiful shape, purely made by math formulas. In this application you can zoom into the shape quite a bit, change colors, make screenshots and while doing that listen to some great music tracks. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Screenshots are found in the same direction you start the.exe from.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p>Right now my company bonogames develops a pretty large VR project that gives people the possibility to see through the eyes of a visually impaired person (VIP).
