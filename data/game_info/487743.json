It was also created for athe No Video Game Jam! There are no camera like objects, so <strong>using Headphones is adviced.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Play as Prisoner, that signed a contract with a malicious company called NS-Robotics to get out of jail. Navigate your way through a test facility full of Vacuum Cleaners, Washing Machines, Cars, Printers and Chainsaw Killer Robots just by orienting yourself by sounds! Defeat the terribly programmed AI, that is behind all of that!</p>\n\n<p><strong>SOUND CREDITS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>All sounds were edited by me using Audacity!</p>\n<p>Robot AI Voice:https://lingojam.com/RobotVoiceGenerator\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Music: <br/></p>\n<p>Steve Ballmer Developers Song: </p>\n<br/>\n<p>Steve Ballmer I love this company song:</p>\n<p>SFX:</p><p>I mean, you can just google Vacuum Cleaner SFX, Washing Machine SFX, Car SFX and walk on concrete SFX<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>QUESTIONS ABOUT MAKING THE GAME:<br/></strong></p><p><strong>First of all: </strong><strong>Thanks to all of my beta testers!</strong> (4)<br/></p><p><strong>How long have you been making the game?</strong> A Maximum of 1.5 days work time. My medical condition really f**ked the process of making this game up!</p><p><strong>Why is the game a comedy horror game?</strong> Originally, it was supposed to be just a comedy game, but 2 of my beta testers were actually scared by Vacuum Cleaners!</p><p><strong>Is this your first game for a game jam?</strong> Yes</p><p><strong>Why is the game so hard? </strong>Again, my medical condition lead to some feature leaks, which are necessary for making the game more balanced! I could start a petition for a new hardest game ever! (It is important to know, that none of the beta testers came further than level 7 . . . out of 20)</p><p><strong>Did you have fun making the game? </strong>Yes, it was something new! A game with no camera objects ment, that i could spent more time on sounddesign! That alone taught me a lot of new stuff!</p><p><strong>Thank you, my beta testers, for these questions!</strong><br/></p><strong>Did I forget to add something on this page? Feel free to comment!<p>Now, have fun raging at my game!<br/></p></strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T06:14:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccd/ccd502989b873c808986c8b106a61a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SlimingHD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
