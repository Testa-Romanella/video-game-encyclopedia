Most of the drawings are from one of team members while me and other member mostly worked on logic part of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To be honest at the end it was a completely mess from coding part. Everything was so complex and i was confusing by looking at code thinking what we've created. But yeah, at least it is working and i think we did a great job on it.</p>\n<p>The thing i like most about this project is parallax effect on background, normally in our first version it wasn't exist. We wanted to add that feature and again we created that background picture ourselves.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T06:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/84672d0846a84fea0589e302aebca0f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustRelaxable"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
