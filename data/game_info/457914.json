You earn money by landing on property squares with investment opportunities, like a sushi restaurant in Ginza or an animation goods store in Akihabara. After you invest, you\u2019ll have to wait until March rolls around for those investments to pay off. In the meantime, be on the lookout for errant monsters that may shower you with riches...or throw a wrench in your plans! You can also earn extra money by landing on item squares, which can either help you reach your own goals or simply ruin your rivals\u2019 plans. If you finish the game with the most money...you win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-16T14:59:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e5/1e5b852207d6afb5c5b78505ae19ad15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment", "acttil"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment", "Acttil"], "esrb_rating": null}
