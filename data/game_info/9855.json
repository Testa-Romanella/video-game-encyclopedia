Due to circumstances beyond his control, our protagonist has recently emigrated to Berlin; a town that brims with an undercurrent of anxiety as war rapidly approaches. Alone in an alien land, he diverts his attention to a mysterious, old house, adamant that it hides secrets in its shadows. An insatiable curiosity leads our protagonist down a very dark path into the murky depths of humanity. As he fights to comprehend his reality, he also fights to make sense of himself.<br/><br/>With light sources scarce, you are equipped with an old gas lamp.
