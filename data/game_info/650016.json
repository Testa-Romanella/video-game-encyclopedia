Take on challenges as requested. When you complete tasks you learn new abilities. But even though you feel more capable, the ding of the notification from the mysterious group reminds you that the game isn't over yet!</p>\n\n<p>This game is heavily influenced by turn based action games such as pokemon or final fantasy.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sadly this game is not a complete experience do to unforeseen schedule conflicts (only had this last day and a couple hours through the week to work on this). There is an intro cutscene, a first battle (gameplay), a second cutscene, and lastly it goes to a second battle, however beating this battle does nothing except loop the game. I am very sorry about that, but hopefully you can at least see what we were aiming for.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Also HTML doesn't want to work, I think it is due to an embedded MP4 video in the game. Not sure how HTML handles that.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programmer/art/voice acting: Seth Funk\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0@S_ionYlla</p>\n<p>Hype-man and Art: mrmufinz</p>\n<p>SFX/Music: ZapSplat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T07:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8d/d8deec6d1255f7662864c8e0dfd4412f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sfunk92"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
