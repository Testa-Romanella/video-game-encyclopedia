Red moves you 1 space, blue moves you 3 and yellow moves you 5. But watch out, if the opponent also picks one of the colours you have chosen then neither of you are able to move. (Is what I would say If I were able to get that mechanic working 100% of the time)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Use the arrow keys to swap between colours and the enter key to select them!<br/><br/>(And just to note; If a character starts to bob up and down then restart the game because they won't move again)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T12:49:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/253/253a90c31fc4e693f9c51a5ffc9ba88c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brb777"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
