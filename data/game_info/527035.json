This makes sense and is good.</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to maneuver The BurgerRunner through three thrilling and jaw dropping levels. Collect burgers to advance to the next level while avoiding cyberpunk thugs. Each level increases The BurgerRunner's jump height and the amount of burgers you must collect.<br/></p>\n<p>Music: \"<em>City Runner II</em>\" by Neko Dreams licensed from Icons8<br/></p>\n<p>I made this game to learn about #phaser3 and developing HTML5 games. Originally I used an Ourcade guide for an infinite jumper, then added some additional features. The game could still be improved significantly but it did the trick already. Making it helped me learn a lot and I hope it brings anyone a little bit of fun to their day.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I'm now working on my next game: CyberWhiskey, a #phaser3 Visual Novel made with RenJS. <br/></p>\n<p>Follow along on twitter!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T09:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d7/6d75147bfe1272d12973b5c65bace02a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Crunch Rock"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
