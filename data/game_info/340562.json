I hope you enjoy and donate I hope to get enough to release on Steam. This game requires a monitor or screen with at least 1920 across and\u00a01080 up. Very basic game BTW.</p>\n<p>The controls are the arrow keys to move and R to restart.</p>\n<p>You are a white dot trying to get the highest score possible, you lose if you touch a red dot and you gain score over time and through collecting the yellow coins. The rainbow dot gives you invincibility for a short time. Achieve your best beat you friends and most importantly have fun.\u00a0</p><p>This is my first game so please donate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:37:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d52/d527d5be872b74e3d6542b08d4cdc4f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Quartermain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
