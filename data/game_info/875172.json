{"id": 875172, "slug": "batty-zabella", "name": "Batty Zabella", "name_original": "Batty Zabella", "description": "<p>Batty Zabella is a point-and-click horror comedy designed to push the limits of outdated hardware, and provide a compelling experience even by 2022 standards.</p>\n<p>It also marks the debut of a new horror icon; Batty Zabella! Help save her family and rid her home of phantoms. She may give you sass while doing it, but you'll love it.</p>\n<p>The game can be enjoyed in browser, or downloaded as a Game Boy ROM to play on legitimate hardware (.pocket format also included for Analog Pocket devices). It's free to play on the web, but I would appreciate if those that enjoy the game also paid for the download to support future installments. The download also comes with a high-res PDF of the poster/cover art painted by\u00a0eli-xa.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>MOBILE BROWSER CONTROLS:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Displayed as touch pad!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>PC BROWSER CONTROLS:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Z</strong>\u00a0- Accept\r\n</li><li><strong>X</strong>\u00a0- Cancel\r\n</li><li><strong>Enter</strong>\u00a0- Inventory\r\n</li><li><strong>Shift\u00a0</strong>- Map\r\n</li></ul>\r\nSAVE DATA WILL BE LOST UPON CLOSING THE BROWSER\u00a0WINDOW!\r\n<p>Created by Kyle Sharpe\r\n<em>Other works at\u00a0</em><em>sharpestories.com</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T10:49:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4a/b4ac0e77fb324de37112310c75aefdb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ice.Cold.Blood"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
