{"id": 890548, "slug": "it-takes-two-to-tango", "name": "It Takes Two To Tango", "name_original": "It Takes Two To Tango", "description": "<p>It takes Two to Tango is an isometric 3D co-op game where the players control either a red or blue character. Based on their colour, these two characters have different abilities - the blue one can't jump whereas the red one can, however, the blue one has faster movement speed which is needed to evade obstacles/hazards. In turn, the red one uses its jump to help reach places that the blue can\u2019t. Their shared goal is to reach the end \u201cportal\u201d (a pink square) which allows them to progress to the next level. Along the way, they must each unlock a barricade for each other - changing it to their respective colours and allowing them to pass through after it has been activated by standing on a pressure plate.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T08:27:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c56/c563b3a978b520f23f85fe6f7448097a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattMuhle"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
