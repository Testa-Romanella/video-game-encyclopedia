One month to work on a game while swamped with university work- sorry that I could only make it beatable in about 30 minutes, rather than the longer idea I wanted to accomplish. I wish I had more work done. It may or may not be updated in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits  are available in the readme.md file.\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:39:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f923381f353fb7951d4d1fa56a786f19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moon Moon Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
