Scour each region for gear from friends and foes alike, but watch out as danger lurks around every corner.

Our game definitely had some high prospects with our original 3 levels, which we had to cut down to only 1, but our quality didn't drop below what we originally planned.</p><p><strong>What we wished was different.</strong></p><p>We believe our biggest 2 cuts were the loss of our star system, and\u00a0the lack of roguelike elements. Originally we had planned to make the game more like a roguelike, with procedural stage generation, however the only element of this we left in was the randomization of items. This does make the game enjoyable and replayable, however it does not feel like a roguelike where you do \"runs\" and it has more replayability.\u00a0</p><p>The star system was planned to reward the player for choosing to fight the boss quickly with worse gear, rather than exploring the stage and gaining items. The benefit of this system would be getting money that the player could spend in a special shop at the beginning of the next stage, but with only one stage there wasn't really a reason to go faster thus we scrapped the idea.</p><p>Overall we are proud with the game, and it was a good look into how much it takes to make even mere minutes of gameplay.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T11:51:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fc/1fc777966698f5481d9c77412e9e93cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lukephilipps"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
