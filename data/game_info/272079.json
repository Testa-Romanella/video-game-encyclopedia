It's a tribute to a famous space opera game. I thought the game as a die and retry, so it's a bit difficult but you gain a lot of skill by training. There are four levels, each has a different objective and a different boss, you gain power-ups between levels. I hope you will have fun, I worked a lot the game feel in flight.\u00a0SAVE THE UNIVERSE COMMANDER !!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/0265e51ec12af48b6501209a3bff94a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rafabinda"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
