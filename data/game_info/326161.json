While not too difficult at first, you may find that the gun you're using isn't quite up to it. Decide what gun you will use in this action-platformer. Beat some of the\u00a0platforming\u00a0\u00a0puzzles to be rewarded!\u00a0 Prepare as you go room-to-room, fighting a never-ending stream of enemies, before facing the final boss! Infinite mode after the boss!</p>\n<p>Joe Candle is actually the result of my first every gamedev college course. This last semester I took an intro course on game dev that really covered basically the industry of game development.\u00a0We got assigned a group to work with and we had about 2 months to work on the project. Over the 2 months we got together once a week to discuss and play test\u00a0but I would take it home and try to work on it when I could before the following week. This game was a great learning experience.\u00a0There are many things I would change about the game but I'm happy I managed to get a fully completed game done by deadline.</p>\n<em>None of the art or music is mine.\u00a0Because this was a class project, we used opengameart for practically all of our assets.\u00a0This includes music and art. I don't have the list of all the authors of all the assets we used.\u00a0However this was only ever supposed to release to our class so I don't have any licensing but I do know we only used assets covered under CC0-public domain.\u00a0 Additionally, this game is only releasing entirely free, with no donations accepted.\u00a0</em>\n<br/>CONTROLS\r\n<ul><li><strong>[ A ] [ D ]</strong> - Move</li><li><strong>[ S ] </strong>- Crouch</li><li><strong>[ E ]</strong> - Interact</li><li><strong>[ Spacebar ]</strong> - Jump</li><li><strong>[ Numpad1 ] <em>or</em> [ L ]</strong> - Shoot</li><li><strong>[ G ]</strong> - Drop gun</li><li><strong>[ Escape ]</strong> - Restart game</li><li><strong>[ P ]</strong> - Debug<ul><li>While in debug:<ul><li><strong>[ M ]</strong> - Teleport to end of level</li><li><strong>[ B ] </strong>- Add\u00a0money</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T21:05:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c9/9c94cd9c30c4172cc2940bd6a90e8dfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kalfin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
