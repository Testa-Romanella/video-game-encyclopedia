Eventually we intend to implement a prayer request system where people can post and pray for prayer requests in the game, but presently it is just an online world where people can meet together and \u00a0create their own worship experiences. There is a \u00a0beautiful world to explore, and more content is planned to come. Currently the game is for Windows PC computers.<br/></p>\n<p>All donations go to \u00a0help the developers in creating this virtual world for you.
