The capital city is a big place, with many curious individuals lurking behind its walls--some friendly, some...well...not so friendly. And with the player being given more freedom than ever before to explore this new city, who can say what kind of trouble young Matt might find himself in now?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-02T02:34:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/532df98737248ceba9d6c0fefb760e0b.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3084036", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
