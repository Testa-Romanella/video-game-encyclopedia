Pirates!\r\n<p>This game was originally inspired by a test question involving pirates and potato guns from my Grade 12 Physics class. I got a protoype working at the time, but feature creep lead me to abandon the project. After laying dormant\u00a0on my GitHub for years, I decided to clean it up and release it. I've stripped out most of the big unfinished features, fixed bugs, polished the existing gameplay, and added music and sound.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, this is basically a mashing game (no pun intended!). Try to survive the endless waves of pirate invaders for as long as possible!</p>\r\nControls\r\nShoot, MenuLeft-click\r\nSwitch weaponRight-click\r\nClose game (desktop only)EscFullscreen (desktop only)F4", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T05:25:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69f8368ce9fed82a6b2af7e42d9afc82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["gabemcarvalho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
