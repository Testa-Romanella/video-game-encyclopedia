Digger is the classic arcade game remastered with complete touch inputs for your iPhone and iPad (also available for your Mac from our website).<br/><br/>Digger is similar to the other popular DOS games Mr. Do! and Dig Dug. You are placed in an underground maze and can dig horizontal and vertical tunnels through it. At various points on the board are emeralds and bags of gold. Monsters (initially in the \"nobbin\" form) appear at the top right-hand corner. If earth is excavated from under a gold bag, then the bag will wobble for a few seconds and then drop releasing gold. Falling bags will squash monsters, but they will also squash the digger. The digger has a weapon, which fires in a straight line, but takes several seconds to recharge (taking longer as the levels go higher).<br/><br/>Monsters sometimes change from the \"nobbin\" form to the \"hobbin\" form. Hobbins also have the power to excavate and can destroy emeralds and gold bags while so doing.<br/><br/>When a monster is killed, another will appear at the top right-hand corner of the screen. Once all the monsters for the level have been created, a cherry appears in their place. If the digger collects this, bonus mode is entered, and for about fifteen seconds the digger is able to eat the monsters (similar to Pac-Man).<br/><br/>A level ends when all the emeralds are gone or all the monsters have been killed.<br/><br/>Note: There are no in-app purchases needed (and no ads) if you paid to download the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:09:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1193ca33a908c1c850e073023d29ca_DBXCMJf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sai Praneeth"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Card"], "publishers": ["Sai Praneeth"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
