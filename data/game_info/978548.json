Despite the hiccups that naturally occur when a quiet librarian and an internationally famous music producer collide, they hit it off and eventually decide to meet up. The moment Rai takes off the futuristic helmet he\u2019s known for always wearing, he reveals to Francis his biggest secret: he is actually a Dullahan, a mythical being who has no head.<br/><br/>While lugging around her own emotional baggage, can Francis make a relationship work with this nice young man who also happens to be a headless pop star?<br/><br/>- - -<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Over 140,000 words<br/></li><li>9 different endings<br/></li><li>A heavily electronic, hip-hop soundtrack<br/></li><li>3 very cute cats \u2014 as you progress, unlock special scenes from the cats' POV<br/></li><li>the majority of the most emotionally charged scenes occur at Waffle House</li></ul><h3>Please Take Note:</h3>the head well lost is a commercial otome game with one character route that takes place over the course of about a year. Francis and Rai start dating fairly early on in the game. Thus, the maintenance of the relationship is the main point, not the pursuit.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of Rai's job, he and Francis are not always together. This is especially true for about the first half of the game. As a result, a good chunk of the story occurs through <strong>text messages</strong> and <strong>phone calls</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Content warnings:</strong> There are a handful of fade-to-black, text-only references to consensual sex. There are also textual depictions of legal alcohol consumption and some violence.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-15T10:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/21091117b01573e6d1600e69123d9006.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["L\u00b3"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["L\u00b3"], "esrb_rating": null}
