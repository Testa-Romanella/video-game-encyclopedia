So after that they returned to the asteroid belt and instead of mining and removing resources they linked all the asteroids together and formed an enclosed megastructure encircling their star and called their new home Megalopolis. They controlled the temperature by adjusted solar venting voids in the megastructure and collected all the power they needed from great arrays of star facing solar panels and sustained the lives of 420 quadrillion citizens. All was well.

There are several missions for you to complete, some of which involve having to use math or remember coordinates that scientists give you in the meeting scene on planet Frozania. The first mission is independent on the other missions, but the next 3 depend on weather you complete the missions successfully,\u00a0 and the last mission can only be reached if you completed the previous mission successfully. After each mission the game will automatically save a screenshot to the log book, you can also save screenshots to it whenever you want by pressing ENTER(windows) or B(game pad, android) and view the log book via the menu. There are 8 different ending scenarios\u00a0 that depend on how well you completed all of the missions.</p>\n<p>NOTE ON ANDROID: Do not take screenshots while the game is saving log book screenshot entries (when the game screen changes size for a couple seconds it is saving a screenshot to the log book) or the game will crash, no fix available for this because you cannot take 2 screenshots at once.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>All music composed by Eric Matyas @ http:soundimage.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa049f663ed5ef44ce61288b6bd51e60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Roadhammer Gaming"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
