{"id": 584389, "slug": "smooch-em-up", "name": "Smooch 'Em Up!", "name_original": "Smooch 'Em Up!", "description": "<p>Hiya everyone!</p>\n\n<p>In Smooch 'Em Up!, you play as a well-dressed Dolphin with a Turtle companion\u00a0that wants to protect her water from mad chickens, using the power of love! Try to survive, defeating as many chickens as you can, in this infinite\u00a0arcade game with an ever-changing map!</p>\n\n<p>The Dolphin automatically follows the mouse cursor; take aim with the mouse cursor and\u00a0shoot kisses by pressing the E button, the Space button or the mouse's Left Click. You can also have the Dolphin stay still by holding the X button or the M button.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can choose from the Options menu\u00a0to use the WASD movement to move with WASD or with the arrow keys.</p>\n\n\n<p>The chickens will appear at an increasing rate, and they'll try to eliminate your water tiles, but they'll try to knock you out too, so watch out!</p>\n\n<p>Your Turtle companion will help you by digging up water tiles! He'll do it every now and then, but you can also decide to shoot him a heart to make him dig immediately. Note that the Turtle must be on the ground to dig up new water, and that he gets\u00a0scared when chickens are nearby!</p>\n\n<p>He will hide in his shell until you defeat those pesky enemies.</p>\n\n<p>When a Turtle digs up some water, there's a chance a new Turtle friend spawns from it! Pay attention to where the Turtles are, because water is very important, for two reasons: it slows down chickens, and heals you!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Stay in the water for a while to heal from damage!</p>\n\n<p>After a while, power-ups will start to spawn on the map. They're yellow hearts full of electricity.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>When you pick up a power-up, you'll begin glowing of a yellow light: this means that your next kiss will generate an unstoppable\u00a0giant heart, full of the POWER OF LOVE! Use this powerful kiss wisely, to defeat many chickens with a single heart!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The map won't reset between games. This means that when you play again, the map will be the same as when you finished the last game. Additionally, you'll start with more Turtle companions if you defeated enough chickens across all games. Keep playing, and you'll start with more and more Turtle companions and keep beating your record!</p>\n\n<p>From the Options menu, you can reset your save file if you feel like starting the game with the default map and one starting\u00a0Turtle companion!</p>\n<p>This game was made as a self-imposed challenge, where I took suggestions from Twitter users\u00a0to build a game around.
