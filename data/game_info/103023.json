The eventual goal is to have most things procedurally generated.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype, so there's not much to do right now. You can buy equipment, explore a bit, fight monsters, find treasure in dungeons. If you explore enough, you find paths to other regions.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of placeholders.</p>\n<p>The game automatically saves when you rest at the tavern in a town.</p>\n<p>I take my inspiration from old ZX Spectrum games like Valhalla and, well, The Crystal Orb.</p>\n<p>Throughout revision 0.2 I will be focusing on improving the towns\u00a0 and adding quests.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Should you Donate?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Donations of even small amounts tell me there is interest in the game. If for any reason I reach a milestone in donations, I can take time off my day job and put that time into bringing the game from Prototype to Alpha. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Leave Feedback</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In the discussion board below. Crystal Orb is pretty rough at the moment, but if you have any suggestions for UI or gameplay, let me know. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d4945c8685df03c7e0d948dbe964dbe5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marasmusine"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
