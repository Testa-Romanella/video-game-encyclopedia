She will get super angry to see this mess...</p>\n<p>Use wasd to control the boi, go collect all the dirty socks in the room and THEN put them into the washing machine!\u00a0</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Postmortem...</p>\n<p>This game is designed based on our childhood experience of clean up the mess before parents get home. There are 12 socks to be collected, a \u201cdoor\u201d for success - the washing machine, and a wandering cat, who gets in your way when you\u2019re tying to rush up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Successes:</p>\n<p>The scene switches, buttons, controls all went on well, a simple scenario background is created to motivate the player to play the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Failure:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something\u2019s wrong with the setting of the UI interface and the main camera view, I couldn\u2019t preview the actual game scene in the \u201cgame\u201d\u00a0 window. This made it difficult to align characters and texts to the right place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lessons Learned:</p>\n<p>It\u2019s better to optimize the code with Public variables.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Future development:</p>\n<ol><li>Add a count down timer, if you couldn\u2019t send all the dirty socks into the washing machine, mom will come home and you will fail</li><li>Make the cat wandering inside the room to be a hinder</li><li>Add sound effect</li><li>I'm still having a bit trouble with the alignment of canvas and texts, as the text is not appearing where it's supposed to be at. Hope to fix that in the future</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f8de7247e1ee6eb024980580cdf6ba2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["liangyq404"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
