I wish to collect some feedback and see if there is any desire for such a game, and therefore hope that you will play the game, test it and give me any feedback you can think of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game itself is a platforming game, where you can only move by firing your gun and using the kickback from the gun to fly where you need to. It's a simple prototype that was made in a couple of days and does not contain art and assets that would be used in the final product.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pixelrain Studios &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb383701ee789288b11767cf4003a288.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelrainStudios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
