Can you return before a new day begins?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Control your vampire through a dark landscape, searching for blood fountains that will help you upgrade your powers. Here, death is expected; when you die you will be able to activate your upgraded powers, although you will have\u00a0to navigate the land all over again.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game is quite tough, and you might have to restart from the beginning several times -\u00a0but don't give up! The map is the same each time, and so as you upgrade your powers you will be able to journey further and further, and might be able to discover shortcuts, allowing you to recover your progress much faster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nevertheless it is possible to beat the game on the very first run, though this will be especially challenging.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub repository:\u00a0https://github.com/ewenedmunds/OutrunTheSun</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Kindred Community Jam II, with the theme of \"Death is a New Beginning\". I\u00a0tried to interpret this in two ways:</p>\n<p>1. Each death restarts the map, and so every death brings a new beginning to a run\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. In the game you must beat the sunrise, and every death will reset this timer, thus bringing a new dawn to beat; a literal new beginning to the day</p>\n\n<p>This theme was really fun to work with, and I\u00a0hope you enjoy playing the game!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T02:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bad279e76e356697b448c68adee23ee5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ewenedmunds"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
