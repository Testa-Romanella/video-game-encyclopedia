If the player fails to do so, the glass floor will start shattering little by little and the game will end with the player falling to its death.</p>\n<p>The main objective of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible, and the point system will reward those who do so. Once the game ends, a leaderboard will be displayed showing all the Top Scores from other players.</p>\n<p>Gameplaywise,\u00a0\u00a0Glassbreakers is\u00a0 a Third-Person-Shooter, but since looking up and shooting from this perspective is not optimal, the player can press right-click to switch from tank to turret-mode. In Tank mode the player can move around in 3rd Person and shoot. In Turret mode the player stands still and switches the action to a First-Person perspective, allowing the player to aim much more carefully.</p>\n<p>The game is still in its beggining stages and should be finished by the end of July.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T08:19:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03d4de972317a3ae2e48818459b1ac47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jo\u00e3o Silva"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
