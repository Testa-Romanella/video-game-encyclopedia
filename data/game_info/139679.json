Well, this is just like that, except it's Tennis for Two and a Half. Yeah. And it's also Pong. Basically, you and your opponent are bouncing a ball back and forth without letting it get into your goal. First  to ten points wins. Seems simple enough, right?</p><p>Wrong. The thing is, there's also troll faces (the half) that are bouncing around the screen trying to make the ball bounce, so you'll never know where it's going to go. Also you can wrap around the screen. See if you can use that to your advantage. Finally, there's lasers. No joke, you can actually shoot lasers from your paddles. You've got to try this game.</p><p>--Controls--</p><p>Player 1:</p><p>Move: W and S</p><p>Lasers: Space bar</p><p>Player 2:</p><p>Move: Arrow keys</p><p>Lasers: Control/Ctrl</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b0/5b0c6a55cd71caec4f998546bc7a7067.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Omega Gaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
