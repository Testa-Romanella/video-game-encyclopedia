You get your first Curse Power by clicking on the castle. Now you can use your Curse Power to curse a villager. After he is cursed, he will automatically produce more Curse Power for you! Every time you buy the highest possible villager, you unlock a new villager! If you feel, your progress is to slow, you can restart with the multiplier next to the Ascending-Button. By clicking the Ascending Button you lose all you cursed villager, but next time, they will produce more Cursing Power for you!</p>\n<p>ATTENTION: At the moment the game is only saved after the Ascending Button is clicked. I have no idea why, because it should save every 5 sec. It works in the Editor, but sadly not in the Browser now. I will find and fix this bug an upload a new file after the rating for the Jam has ended!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:40:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/811/811705c810d90f8e6491498ad9eb187e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BelindaTesiGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
