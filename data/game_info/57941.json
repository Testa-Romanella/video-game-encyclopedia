It bears little relation to the film Ultraman Tiga &amp; Ultraman Dyna: Warriors of the Planet of Light, though it does match up with some parts of the Ultraman Tiga and Ultraman Dyna series. It is more like Ultraman Fighting Evolution, being an arcade-style fighter (keep going until you run out of credits), and as such, it is often mistakenly included in the series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T08:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/027/0273ecf0017d3c19a787439b21e3a9f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Bandai"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Bandai"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
