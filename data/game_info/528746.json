{"id": 528746, "slug": "planet-lev", "name": "Planet LEV", "name_original": "Planet LEV", "description": "<strong>PLANET LEV-MATADERO</strong> is a world born in the nebulas of cyberspace. Built of vertices and quads, it was shaped in millions of cycles out of pure terrain data to resemble the world you see today. The dominant species of this planet are the Nimis, sentient beings that are the most renown collectors in cyberspace. Their love for arts has made them dedicate their whole planet to the beauty of creative expression.  <br/><br/>As you walk along the horreo habilis, the homes of Nimis, you might catch the giant in action, pass through digital storms, wander in biodomes, or find other artworks until you lose yourself in the canyons. One last piece of advice: beware of the diva trees, they tend to have strong attitudes. <br/><br/>At the core of this planet lies a temple, dedicated to AV performances, whose dome rests half buried amidst the stones. On its walls, artists project live performances while the sounds of their electronic music resonate all the way to the surface, making the whole atmosphere vibrate to those rhythms.<br/><br/>When you decide to end your journey, don't forget to pass by the desert to leave your trace and plant a tree that will stay until the last cycle of the planet.<br/><br/>**********************************************************************************<br/><br/><strong>PLANET LEV-MATADERO</strong> is an immersive art experience created by the Children of Cyberspace, available in both <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> and on Web browsers. This dream-like universe hosts animated sculptures with <strong>sound installations</strong>, as well as concerts and live audio-visual performances of artists from all around the world. The whole Planet is an <strong>immersive stage</strong>, where those happenings are taking place in real time. The virtual scenery has been inspired by the Asturian landscape, home of the LEV Festival.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T03:15:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a4/5a49bb97090a53c49ec7555e461ab95a.jpg", "website": "http://planet.levfestival.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Children of Cyberspace", "In-Dialog Collective"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["LEV Festival"], "esrb_rating": null}
