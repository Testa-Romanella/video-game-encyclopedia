If all the obstacles are cleaned from the water, voyage may be one of the most enjoyable activities in the world. Crazy Torpedo is a shooting game in which you launch torpedoes to destroy various things in the water to make a better environment for navigating. Your targets are manatees, dolphins, mermaids and other objects. Different objects mean different scores. Don\u2019t hit the boat otherwise you will lose your game. Drag the torpedo to aim, the longer you hold screen before releasing, the more powerful your weapons will be. Calculate the distance carefully and try not to miss any targets.
