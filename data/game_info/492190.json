Her car stops in front of a big house with blue lights shining throw the open front door. As curious and desperate as she is, Patricia decides to take a closer look and perhaps find someone who could help her. But she manages to get herself into trouble AGAIN! Now she's captured by evil spirits for some unknown satanic rituals and has to find a way to get out of there before she ends up dead. All she has to do is to unlock a few doors, find some ancient objects, solve some puzzles and with good timing and usage of her newly discovered \"power\" protect herself against the evil spirits and maybe kill one or two. If she's lucky, she might find some fuel and a piece of some really weird and creepy ritual. It's all in your hands, to get Patricia out of there.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T10:46:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/701/7012446af2a858a7c626533e8d86579a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KangarooUnderlord"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KangarooUnderlord"], "esrb_rating": null}
