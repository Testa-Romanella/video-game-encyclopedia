You will control your \"computer empire\" viewing a world map and managing resources.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Start your adventure in the 70s as a small business somewhere in the world. Learn more about hardware and software inventions that were the first steps to our current modern world, and get a taste of what is waiting for us in the future. Find the classic video games and help a new culture to be born.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In Computer Tycoon the decisions you make during development really matter. Take advantage of the technology, upgrade and design combinations! Does your product need more computing capacity or should you focus more on features, low price or prestige? Maybe change to portable computers or develop more easy-to-use Operating Systems? These decisions will have a major impact on the success of your company.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expand your corporation in a smart way into multiple countries, build more offices, factories, laboratories and other required facilities. Poor countries have cheaper labor, but richer countries will give you more educated engineers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Having the best product isn't enough. You must take care of people's needs or even \"change their needs\" using different marketing tools. Balance your budget well between development, production, marketing, and expansion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We'll all die one day... but not in Computer Tycoon! You can win the game by becoming a monopoly or reaching the technological singularity if you are fast and healthy enough. Healthy? Yes, you have a small chance to die in the game, so you should regularly check your health.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de9/de935045a4e36009d4d570d635f4175b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Progorion"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
