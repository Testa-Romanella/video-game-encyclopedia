The concept is that Modok wins, there is no lose condition for the game.  Modok can shoot explode or sheild his way through waves of enemies till the timer is up.  The score is arbitrary, not necessarily random, but with random spawns you should never get the same score twice.  This game is as silly as it is simple and I hope everyone that plays it enjoys it.  </p><p>Controls.</p><p>Arrow keys move you</p><p>A - Analyze Cube</p><p>Space Bar - Laser</p><p>Collide with enemies to raise your shield</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Art and Design</p><p>Adrian Lienard - slyshand</p><p>http://slyshand.deviantart.com/<br/></p><p>Sebastien Lienard - @sebasebsebs</p><p>http://sebasebs.tumblr.com/</p><p>Sound</p><p>Richard Jordon - Ryouba<br/></p><p>Special thanks</p><p>Jacquie Goyena</p><p>Lauren Admire</p><p>Keeden Hopkins</p><p>I don't own any of the characters involved.
