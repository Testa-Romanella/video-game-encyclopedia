Fluxly Zero brings a whole new approach to knob twiddling and sound making.<br/><br/>In Fluxly Zero you can choose from a bank of built-in sound samples and play them back in either direction at any speed. By touching two Fluxum and pushing them together you can link them into looping gear train machines. You can also enable movement and let the built-in physics engine take over as the Fluxum bounce around the instrument for random sonic fun.<br/><br/>With the full version of Fluxly in the App Store you can record your own samples. <br/><br/>This is a universal app for iPhone or iPad.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:08:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b68/b68caf0c57d2ed4894295ebce4abf877_2ElIUx8.jpg", "website": "http://fluxly.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fluxama"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Shawn Wallace"], "esrb_rating": null}
