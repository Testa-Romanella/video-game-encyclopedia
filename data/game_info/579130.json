This was made for the retro platform game jam, all the assets were made within the duration of the jam. This game was made using the GBStudio visual scripting engine, you can go check it out, its a great software. The music, sfx and the dialogue sprites for this game was not made by me, but they were all royalty free. All the sprites, tilesets, and level design were created by me. I hope you enjoy your experience with this game, feel free to send me some constructive criticisms about the experience, and ways of how I can improve, as I am just a beginner indie developer who is willing to learn.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>--CREDITS--</p>\n<p>Overworld Theme [Darkstone] -\u00a0Ember#1765\u00a0 DeerTears</p>\n<p>Victory Fanfare - kr\u00fcmel (crumb)#0723</p>\n<p>GBStudio Fonts -\u00a0Jeremy Oduber</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T07:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/049/04964d460186e79ac5534d043011f24a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SeanSS"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
