You cannot move and attack at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>If you press the attack button while in the air, you will do a single spinning attack that bounces you upwards if you hit something.</p>\n\n<p>The bomb allows you to attack from a distance, but can also hurt you. Pressing the bomb button once releases it.\u00a0 Pressing it again locks it in place.\u00a0 Pressing it once more detonates it. It will detonate on its own if left alone.</p>\n\n<p>You can shoot the bomb upwards by holding up while pressing the bomb button.</p>\n\n<p>Sliding allows you to gain a quick bit of speed while allowing you to bypass enemy attacks. Hold the slide button for a longer slide.</p>\n\n<p>The light blue rails can only be traversed while on your board. The board allows you to move at higher speeds at the cost of losing a quick damaging melee combo and more difficult handling.</p>\n\n<p>Pressing the slide button while on your board and on a rail will allow you to drop through. If you press it while on the ground, you will slide off the board.</p>\n\n<p>Turning around while on the board will reverse your momentum. This is also an attack, and if it hits an object, bomb, or enemy, then it will give you a speed boost as well. Like the slide, pivoting allows you to bypass enemy attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Attacking while on the board makes you do a simple spin attack. this can be done on the ground or in the air, and allows you to bypass enemy attacks, but it also slows you down.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Techniques (Read when you've got the above somewhat down)</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>In order to complete the area, you'll need to utilize your bomb as a source to bounce yourself with an aerial attack. This is a \"bomb jump.\"</p>\n\n<p>Holding right/left, slide, and then the jump key will allow you to slide jump to traverse greater distances and maximize the speed boost that the slide gives you. If you release the d-pad/arrow keys/analog stick from the direction you're moving in, you will lose the boost. You'll know you're doing it correctly based on the blue after-images.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Pivoting off of an object, enemy, or bomb while in the air will give you an upward boost.</p>\n\n<p>Combine different techniques and actions to reach new areas, and use the bomb excessively for platforming.</p>\n<p><strong>Max gem score possible in this area is 300. Getting hit drops your score by 10.\u00a0 The timer will stop once you've gathered every gem and your results will be added to a leader board.
