Your going to meet all the behaviour a game developer is doing while creating games for instance:<strong> Typing Code , Cry because of some retarded errors.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>You have to code a game in a small period of time. While coding errors will pop and there you have to cry to get rid of it. Errors are decreasing your motivation that is bad because without motivation you can't continue on working on the game (you <em>lose</em>). Don't forget to write enough so your game isn't trash on release.</p>\n<p>Your donation will support the development of my actual games. This one is just a small project I've done in 3 days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:56:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c71/c71225c6ed6d243209c10bbbd9a89687.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RoStudio1"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
