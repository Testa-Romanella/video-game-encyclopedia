Goblins will sometimes spawn, and will try to break the meteors (and you)! If the meteor gets destroyed, you will not be able to get the gold, so make a strategy to defend the meteorite (I also wanted to add turrets but oh well -_-). Also sometimes the BIG BAD GOBLIN BOSS will spawn, and that will be a challenge to face.</p>\n<p>Killed goblins will also drop COOKIES (because why not), and you will be able to spend Cookies and Gold at THE SHOP! There you can purchase powerful upgrades and become the ULTIMATE GOBLIN SLAYER or THE ULTIMATE GOLD MINER!</p>\n<p>There are also quests that can be completed! Will you complete all of them and rack up the FINAL REWARD?\u00a0(Little spoiler: it could lag a bit).</p>\n<p>With this said, upgrade your pick, mine some gold, and HAVE FUN!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: Movement</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p>1 &amp; 2: switch between Pickaxe and Gun</p>\n<p>T: Open/Close Shop</p>\n<p>ESC: Open/Close Menu</p>\n<p>Left-Shift: Run</p>\n\n\n<p>WARNINGS: if you are playing this from Windows and not web browser, be prepared to use Alt+F4 or Task Manager to quit the game. Because I forgot to add a \"Quit\" Button.\u00a0<br/>Also the game is bugged as heck, so don't shock when the animations glitch out or enemy AI just stops working all together, because I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING MYSELF.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T10:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59e1d93a643a59ff9fe5daa5b10cc51a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Distru121"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
