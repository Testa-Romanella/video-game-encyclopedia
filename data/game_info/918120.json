The theme was \"Build Your Way Out\". This is my first game as well so feedback would be nice :D</p>\n<p>I know that there are probaby more bugs in this game than unique\u00a0features (technically not true because it's not a bug,\u00a0it's a feature!) but the time is over which means i can't fix them anymore. I will (hopefully) remake this project entirely and add more levels, a story and maybe a brand new mechanic that i feel like would go along well with this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm sorry for not getting the WebGL build\u00a0to work. I tried it for over 1 hour and failed. However i made a\u00a0Windows build and i will try to make MacOS/Linux builds if i can\u00a0 figure out how to do that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T07:44:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2d/a2d2b5b7416314e15ad99b72de891073.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RemecArt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
