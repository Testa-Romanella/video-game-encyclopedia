This is a spin-off mini-game based on early development of the full game of\u00a0Cuddle Kobold! The full Cuddle Kobold will have a very different feel, but with optional mini-games and other activities like this to play.</p>\n<p>The rules are simple: It's Nighttime, and the Kobold is looking for a Midnight Snack. Glowies will tide them over until the morning's food delivery, but they might just magically nibble at your height in the meantime! Keep your distance, hide in tucked-away spaces or on top of things if need be, and track down enough Glowies to sate their hunger!</p>\n<p>If this is a bit much for you, or not your first time through, you can skip to Daytime by clicking on the Snowglobe, or using the Settings Menu. You can also play other difficulty levels if you want more of a challenge, and try to beat your Best Times!</p>\n<p>While the full release of Cuddle Kobold! will contain optional mature content, I've made sure Just a Bite is Safe For Work, and does not contain any adult content or themes.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Please note:</strong></em> Cuddle Kobold: Just a Bite is designed first and foremost for VR. That is the best way to play it. <strong>However,</strong>\u00a0there is an alternate version included with your purchase that will use<strong> </strong>a Simulator to allow for Mouse + Keyboard play on a regular monitor. This has not been tested extensively, and will not be the best way to experience the game, but it is available if you have no other method and still wish to experiment with the game.</p>\n<p>Current builds require a PC, but can be played on some mobile VR platforms like the Quest 2 using a USB tether, Air Link, or other wireless methods. I'll be looking into a Quest 2 Standalone release following Just a Bite's public launch.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>VR Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Body movement: Left Stick/Touchpad</li><li>Teleportation: Trigger/Click in Stick</li><li>Rotation: Right Stick/Touchpad</li><li>Grab: Grip Button</li><li>Remote Grab: Hold Grip + Press Trigger (only works when line is Blue)</li><li>Open/Close Settings Menu: Menu/Start Button</li><li>Select Menu Options/Buttons: Point with Controller until line appears, Press Trigger</li><li>Reset Scene: Hold Menu/Start Button for 3 Seconds</li><li>\u00a0Change Desktop View: V on Keyboard</li></ul>\n<p>\u2022 If Controllers seem rotated incorrectly, try \"Controller Rotation Fix\" in Graphics settings!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Simulator </strong>(No Headset)<strong> Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>This simulator is a bit experimental and a late addition!<br/>Please try to play Cuddle Kobold: Just a Bite with a VR headset and controls if you can.</p>\n\n<p>Change Desktop View: V<br/>Unlock Cursor from Game: U or Right Mouse Button<br/>Toggle Simulator Off/On: H</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Body movement: W, A, S, D</li><li>Crouch: Ctrl</li><li>Adjust View: Hold Right Mouse Button and Drag</li><li>Left Hand movement: Hold Q</li><li>Right Hand movement: Hold E</li><li>Both Hands movement: Hold Q + E</li><li>Move Hand(s) Toward or Away: Hold Q and/or E, use Scroll Wheel</li><li>Reset Hands to default position: R</li><li>Grab with Left Hand: Hold Q + Left Mouse Button</li><li>Grab with Right Hand: Hold E + Left Mouse Button</li><li>Grab with Both Hands: Hold Q + E + Left Mouse Button</li><li>Open/Close Settings Menu: Space Bar</li><li>Left Hand Teleport / Interact with Menus: X</li><li>Right Hand Teleport / Interact with Menus: C</li></ul>\n<p>\u2022 If you're having issues selecting a Radial Menu option, move the other hand away from the menu.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Some UI buttons (Back &amp; Close, Mute Music, Reset Table) are only selectable when the hand is very close.
