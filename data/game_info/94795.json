This is the full, uncut development process - meaning over 250 hours of my cringy self learning, struggling, sweating and chipping away at this project. You can follow me on Twitter\u00a0for some updates on my current projects.<br/></p>\n<p>If you like this, I encourage you to check out the original! It's playable via ScummVM.<br/>And if you'd like to support my future endeavors, please consider supporting me on Patreon!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e2c5bf7370014ed1799b8ca1b95bced.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ravenok"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
