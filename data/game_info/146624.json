For Compo version see bottom<br/></p><p>The sun has always only given, now is our chance to give something in return.</p><p>Leaving its frail cradle, mankind has put all its efforts into building a flying maw which can create strong temporary gravity fields. You must pull nearby stars into the sun to fill it to its very brim.</p><p>Use the mouse to create gravity wells to move the stars. Click them again to make them disappear.<br/></p><p>You have only limited energy at your disposal. You can devour some energy from stars, but take care and do not devour too much for then the sun will miss out. Whatever you do, don't run out of energy.<br/></p><p>Done for the Ludum Dare 33 Compo in 48h.</p><p>Compo version controls: Use W, A, S and D to move the maw. Use E or Left Ctrl to activate the gravity field. Z to change camera angle.<br/></p><p>\"Space - it's stupid and boring but we can do something about it.\"</p><p>Source at: https://github.com/ArchBang85/Accursed-Stare<br/></p><p>@ArchBang85</p><p>Accreditations:</p><p>Lullaby samples: http://www.pdsounds.org/tag/lullaby</p><p>Planetary texture: http://freebitmaps.blogspot.co.uk/2010/12/srgb-pla...</p><p>Baby sounds: Mushroom Jesus - http://www.freesound.org/people/mushroomjesus/soun...</p><p>Why eat stars?
