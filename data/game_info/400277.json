Also, besides some English errors you'll find the character image is a temporary asset (a weird arrow), I forgot to change it to the silhouette image I did (silly I know). I'll change it afterwards when the jam is over.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, I wanted to have a bit of fun and make a tiny game and here it is.
