We (the developers) also take inspiration from many modern games as well as old games and have tried to implement gameplay systems that not only reflect the retro scene but rather modern gaming as well (We're not putting Day 1 DLC or a QTE final boss though so don't worry about that!).</p><p>There is a Public demo available for download free of charge. We appreciate any and all feedback on this demo and hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d2777b140e5d71e9cdf38227a18ff912.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["No WiFi Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
