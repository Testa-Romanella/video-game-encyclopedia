How long can you run the tightrope before tripping down a pit of your own greed?<br/></p>\r\nI made this game for myself, I use it as a kind of training for my own impulsive behavior. I've played it hundreds of times for the past year.<br/><br/> The game is a practice of patience, of self control, and of understanding your limits. The moment you get too eager you end up accidently turning into a pit. This game seems relentlessly hard at first ,impossible to beat, and yet if you train yourself to notice when your attention is out of focus, when you aren't ready. If you take that time to take a break, think ahead, think of the consequences before you act. you can get further.  \r\n<p><em>There is a unique, one of a kind, real material, special reward for the <strong>KING </strong>who can master the game and attain the game's highest rank first.
