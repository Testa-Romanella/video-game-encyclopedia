Movement is based on a tile system, each turn the player can move to any adjacent tile, and the vampire hunters also move one tile. The catch is that the vampire hunters have torches and flashlights, and can see ahead. If the vampire is caught in the hunter&amp;#39;s line-of-sight, all the hunters in the neighborhood will converge and attempt to corner the vampire, resulting in death.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>Adam Smith http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/27/lamp-and-vamp-is-the-best-free-game/  <br/>&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a puzzle game in which you play a vampire who is trying to return to his coffin. Pesky townspeople and priests block the way but using your powers (BAT-FORM, MIST-FORM, BLOODSUCKING), you can navigate the streets and find your way home.
