It is\u00a0based on Season 2, Episode 5 of The Good Place, and in some sense it\u00a0includes spoilers for that show. The game was built in PICO-8.</p>\n<p>The episode and the game both are centered on The Trolley Problem, a classic thought experiment in ethics.\u00a0Although this game is interactive, it uses only one button, and it includes multiple dialogue sequences. As the player, you effectively control the action at key decision points by deciding whether or not to pull the levers that will switch the trolley track.</p>\n<p>A full, single playthrough of the game, without skipping any of the dialogue, takes a little under 10 minutes. You may want to play it more than once to see different outcomes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7d/d7d624c06678001013faa76bb43a5d14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joe Lafiosca"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
