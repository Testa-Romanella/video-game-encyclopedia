Eat food to grow and dominate as much space as possible.</p>\n<p>Different food colours give the cucumbers different amounts of nutrition (see chart for reference), but when they consume food that's the same colour as them, they gain a bigger growth boost.</p>\n\n<p>Because they're sea cucumbers, they need to come up to the surface to breathe - if they don't they'll start getting shorter until they violently suffocate and die.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Supports up to 4 players local multiplayer, but if you're lonely you can set the other players to computer opponents.\u00a0The AI was made in one day and is very poor. If you want more classic gameplay, switch off the other players and go for a high score.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Each player gets 4 movement options like in classic snake: up, down, left and right.</p>\r\nNote: numlock must be on for player 4's controls<br/>Idk if this program works on a Mac btw.\r\n\n<p>Made in C++ with SFML, using Visual Studio 2019.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Github link for source code:\u00a0https://github.com/Niblet-0/SeaCucumberGame</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Programming: Niblet</li><li>Graphics: Niblet</li><li>SFX: Niblet</li><li>Music: Kanye West</li></ul>\n\n<p>(I KNOW SEA CUCUMBERS DON'T\u00a0NEED AIR TO BREATHE BUT THIS WAS A MUCH MORE INTERESTING TITLE THAN 'WATER SNAKES')<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T10:44:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d859e15a9c5d6948e9507da05c471ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niblet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
