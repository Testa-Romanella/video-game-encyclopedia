The king can add up and multiply his animal underlings to match whatever enemy opposes him! He is on a quest for glory, slaying the horrible monsters that plague the animal realm, and recruiting valiant heroes to add up to his numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvery encounter is a puzzle to be solved with logic and simple algebra! Get access to more mathematical operations as you progress, expand your party, and gain special powers, so that you may manipulate your party's values to match the enemies'. If all else fails, the boar king can fight too... But if he loses all his health it's game over.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features 3 different areas to complete, each with their unique monsters and boss to beat, with 4 difficulty modifiers\u200b which you can toggle on or off before starting an area. The game plays entirely with the mouse and it typically takes about 20 minutes to complete an area.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T07:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cdef242218e43dc6449d53015e656a80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PUNKCAKE D\u00e9licieux"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PUNKCAKE D\u00e9licieux"], "esrb_rating": null}
