Share your Pyramid Solitaire scores with your friends on Facebook and Twitter.<br/><br/>From Odesys, the makers of the best solitaire games for mobile.<br/><br/>The goal of Pyramid Solitaire is to discard the entire deck by finding pairs of cards that add up to 13, regardless of suit. Kings count as 13 and are discarded singly, Queens as 12, Jacks as 11, etc. The board consists of a Stock, a Pyramid and a Discard Pile. The cards in the Stock can be cycled three times, one at a time. Only cards that are completely uncovered are available for play. Giza and Seven are variations of Pyramid with slightly different board layouts.<br/><br/>Odesys Pyramid Features:<br/>\u2022 Bonus games - Giza and Seven<br/>\u2022 Unlimited Undo and Redo<br/>\u2022 Adjustable cards size (pinch-to-resize)<br/>\u2022 Hints<br/>\u2022 Sound<br/>\u2022 Animations<br/>\u2022 Auto save on exit<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @OdesysSolitaire<br/><br/>Look for other great patience games by Odesys.
