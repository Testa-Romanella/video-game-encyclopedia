There are critters, bottles, and varmints everywhere -- in the barn, in the yard, and in the cornfield. Grandpa has given you an Atari light gun to help protect the farm. The moving targets are a challenge. Can you hit them? If not, try the veggies! They&#39;re fun to shoot at. In the barnyard, bottles and cans on the fence provide great practive for warming up the old shootin&#39; iron. But perfect aim alone isn&#39;t enough. You&#39;ll need speed, too. In the cornfield, birds swoop from the sky and rabbits scamper among the stalks, Owls and other pests appear inside a barn. Each scene can only be reached by hitting enough targest in the scene before. Once you zero in on some fancy shooting scores, Gramps offers you a bonus round by tossing target bottles in the air.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-27T21:45:04", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari 7800"], "developers": ["Atari"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": null}
