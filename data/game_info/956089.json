We were tasked with making an endless runner, and we decided to turn the idea into an endless shooter!\u00a0Taking inspiration from shoot-em-ups and bullet hells of the past, we wanted to take their mechanics but tie in a softer, more childlike aesthetic to them, and this is the result. We hope you enjoy!<br/><br/>Credits:\u00a0Solomon Bell, Jackson Gerard, and Esmerelda Rangel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T10:55:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/427/427721bd21a4afba412643c9b45c40ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SunnieSide_boi"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
