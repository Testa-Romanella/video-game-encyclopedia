{"id": 153106, "slug": "the-breakout", "name": "The Breakout", "name_original": "The Breakout", "description": "<p>This game was originally made for the 26th GM48 game jam. This is the post-jam version with some minor changes.<br/></p>\r\nOverview\r\n<p>You and the rest of your kin have been captured and imprisoned by some mean goblins. Luckily the goblins didn't realize that trying to keep you locked down with a ball and chain was a bad idea. Swing the ball around as a weapon to smash prison bars and fight guards, but be careful: It's just as capable of hurting you as it is your enemies.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Note: The gameplay controls can be reconfigured, these are just the defaults<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<ul><li>Move: Directional keys / Left Stick or D-Pad</li><li>Hold ball in place temporarily: A key / A button</li><li>Pause: Escape key / Start button</li></ul>\r\nMenus\r\n<ul><li>Select: Directional keys / Left Stick or D-Pad</li><li>Confirm: A key / A button</li><li>Back/Cancel: Escape key / Start button</li></ul>\r\nTips\r\n<p>The ball will only do damage once it's moving at a decent speed. Running in circles can help to start (and keep) the ball spinning around you. You can also hold the ball in place (press A by default) then run away from it to give it a boost in speed when it's released. Just make sure to move out of the way once it's released so it doesn't hit you.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Made by Veralos</li><li>Made with GameMaker: Studio</li><li>Sound effects made with Bfxr</li><li>Music made with Beepbox</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f96087e6ae75fa90d1c3f1a3bd375c61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Veralos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
