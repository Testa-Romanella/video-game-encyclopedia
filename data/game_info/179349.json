Do you spend your miles traveling to the east side 4-20 gas station or do you travel to Half Foods in the suburbs (they have a charger out front). \u00a0One choice may provide higher profits at the cost of your car battery. \u00a0The choice isn't always easy! \u00a0</p>\n<p>Think you can hang out at a charger all day? \u00a0Think again! \u00a0The heat gets on to your location pretty fast. \u00a0Spending too much time at a charger just might cut your day short and send you upstate for 5-10. \u00a0Though you can take some solace in knowing that your carbon footprint would be smaller in prison.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/502/502e9bb087c3c2a91d4912cbc3d707d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trumpetx"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
