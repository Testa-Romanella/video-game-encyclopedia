There are NIGHTMARE DEVILS shooting nightmares at you. You can get rid of them by shooting a bubble colored the same as the devil's horns. If a nightmare hits you, you get sent to a maze where you have to light up the DREAM CAMPFIRE to get back in the dream. If you don't manage to do it in time the alarm clock goes off and you wake up.
