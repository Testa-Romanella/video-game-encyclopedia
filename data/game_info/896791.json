Reindeer no longer pull it, but they help by trying to retrieve any gifts that miss a chimney. Help Santa master the new sleigh in time for Christmas delivery by dropping gifts onto chimneys through ten increasingly challenging levels. Earn more points by releasing presents from higher altitudes and landing them on the center, top of the chimneys. Watch the wind speed and direction as it affects how the gifts fall. Also, dodge any glowing snowballs thrown by Jack Frost, who stays hidden off screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T06:48:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/4146146aebb7526a41c8908138305c16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["josephb1"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
