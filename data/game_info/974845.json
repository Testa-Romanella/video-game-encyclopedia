They are unaware of their destination and end up going in circles. When people share such experiences with others, it becomes difficult for them to understand, hence the term \"Ghost's Blockade.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nToday, we have transformed this Chinese folklore into a game. Players need to dispel the fog by decrypting clues and find their way out of the trapped forest.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is adapted from the Chinese folklore \"Ghost Wall.\" It is a game where players progress by finding items, solving puzzles, and gradually clearing each stage. The game consists of a single large map, shaped like a ring. Players start from the entrance of the ring and need to find the path to proceed to the next location in a step-by-step manner. Each level contains one or more puzzles that players must solve. They need to gradually discover ways to solve these puzzles. Throughout the entire map, we have 5 crucial and important items. Players need to explore, search, and unlock locked chests and tomb gates to obtain these key items. Finally, they need to place these items at the door of the level's exit room, open the door, and complete the entire game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game also features an additional storyline. While playing the game, some NPCs will come and disrupt the player's progress in deciphering. Players need to prioritize dealing with these troubles before starting to decrypt, using the items available in the scene. The entire game takes approximately 1.5-2 hours to complete.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T06:18:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4d/d4d17d1c74c938321d23b5aa51da4dd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KX Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KX Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
