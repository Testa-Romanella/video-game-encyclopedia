One of the things I find most frustrating in crafting games is that taking the time to craft something can break up what would otherwise be fast-paced, and exciting gameplay. What I'm experimenting with here is one way to create a simple and\u00a0fast crafting interface for a bullet hell style game.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------</p>\n<p>Press Z to pick up an item, press X to combine it with another item. Run into enemies to deal damage. Pick stuff up, mash it together Macgyver style!</p>\n<p>-----------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>(Apologies for bugs and lack of polish-- Thanksgiving was this week and I haven't had as much time to work on this as I'd like. I think there might be something to this idea, so I'll likely be updating this page with more content soon\u00a0\ud83d\ude04)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:22:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/579/5794ad8952ffe5f9677be7eaa4b373c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tdamron"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
