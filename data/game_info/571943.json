Each stalactite is brittle, so it has only one use. After that, it breaks, and you are missing a weapon until another one falls.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to TheLine for making the music for me, you can check out his work here:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/LiningEnd729</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/liningend-729</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T04:06:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfd/bfd957ad5f083170932da960c834a842.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FartFish"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
