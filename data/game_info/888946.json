It's a veritable gold rush. Will <em>you</em> be the one who fights their way past the monsters and\u00a0finds the dragon's hoard?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course. Jump, run, and fight your way to riches. Just be careful with the magic items scattered around the area. There are some... side-effects.</p>\n<p>This is a project for the\u00a0Transformation Game Jam 2022 that, ah, didn't quiiiite finish in time. I hope you enjoy it still, recycled assets and all.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you encounter\u00a0<strong>technical issues\u00a0</strong>then re-loading the game (via the Pause menu)\u00a0should usually get you out of a soft-lock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You may also have to <strong>disable fullscreen</strong> mode if you run into a problem, because for some reason that I don't understand, object positioning is very subtly different in windowed mode.</p>\n<p><strong>Please download a native build</strong> if you can, the web version might experience performance issues. Also, gamepad support isn't always so great.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong> are listed in-game, and in the readme,\u00a0but here they are again for easy reference. You can also use your MOUSE to CLICK ON STUFF in the menus.<br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard controls can be changed in-game.</p>\n<br/><strong>Gamepad</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong>MoveD-Pad left or right<br/>Left analog stickA and D<br/>Left/right arrow keyJumpBottom face button (likely A)J<br/>InteractD-Pad up<br/>Left analog stick up<br/>W<br/>Up arrow key<br/><br/><br/>Melee\u00a0attackPress right face button <br/>(likely B)Press K<br/>Ranged attackPress upper or right face button <br/>(likely X/Y)Press L<br/><br/><br/><br/>Menu/PausePress STARTPress F12<br/>MapHold down SELECT or BACK <br/>( whatever button is next to Start)Hold down M<br/><br/><br/>Advance dialoguePress bottom or right face button <br/>(likely A/B)<br/>Press J or K<br/>Left click also worksSkip cutscene<br/>Press STARTPress F12<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T15:04:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cc/3cc0798b595d0be9b6dacbfadd2f782a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["KDRGN"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
