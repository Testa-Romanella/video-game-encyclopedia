The mouse is used to control the target and the left mouse button will shoot bullets. Keep in mind that you will not have any other weapons until your points reach 100 and you will receive a third weapon once you reach 250 points. Enjoy the game and please give me feedback. Thank you</p><p>The Updated Version of the Game (TopDownZombies(V1.0.1)) has new art yet the gameplay hasn't changed much. After you kill one zombie, you will be able to use any weapon. Enjoy the Update and please give me feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/888/8887bfddd81e95e8bc9d5f64b263028e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JFlems"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
