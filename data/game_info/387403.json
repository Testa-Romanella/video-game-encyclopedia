Simon Says for rhythm, you first listen and then try to repeat the rhythm you just heard.  As levels progress you are challenged with faster and faster tempos and more and more notes.<br/><br/>You are a gem hunter mining for precious light-note gems.  With your hand-held instrument you can form gems in strange regions of space by replicating the timing of light pulses, filling the voids with light-notes.  The gravity of the light-notes will crystallize space matter into a light-filled gem.  A flawless rhythm gem will retain all of the light notes you send it.  The accuracy of your timing will determine the value of the gem, earning you coins.  Use coin credits in the space vending machine  to upgrade your instruments and sounds.  As you advance in levels you can find new rare gems.<br/><br/>xBeat has many modes of play to suit your style from easy-play to achievements and a leader-board where you can see world rankings.  Joining is as simple as adding a gamer handle.  Add your friends' names if you want to see how you rank amongst your peers.<br/><br/>- Eye candy: Translucent, 3d graphics with random colors and random animation paths for endless freshness<br/><br/>- Ear candy: Rich variety of percussion sounds which can also be used to play like a drum<br/><br/>- Educational Standard: Complete rhythms for exploration<br/><br/>- Bug Free<br/><br/>- Cowbell: Can never have enough", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T03:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb98fd90a2db5b7bbbcf732e0f2a3c35.jpg", "website": "https://musictoolssoftware.com/xbeat.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MusicTools Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": ["MusicTools"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
