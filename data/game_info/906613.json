You are a farmer trying to make a living by thinking a few days ahead and making strategic plans.</p>\n<p>There is no in-game tutorial, so please read the section below.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the menu on the left to buy seeds for gold and plant them in the field on the right.</li><li>End the day so that your seeds can grow and you can earn gold by harvesting them.</li><li>But beware, planting and harvesting seeds is a move-consuming process - and you only have 5 moves each day.\u00a0</li><li>Some seeds can take more than 1 move, while harvesting them only takes 1 move.</li><li>Some seeds can take more than 1 day to become harvestable, so be careful when buying!</li><li>Cost and Income change every two days according to certain values. You should pay attention to these when buying.</li><li>Each day you don't harvest a seed that is due, it will lose 20% of its value, so think carefully about what to spend your moves on.</li><li>You lose a certain amount of money every day, and this value increases every three days, so pay attention to the seeds you plant.</li><li><em>If your money is below 0 AT THE END OF THE DAY, you will LOSE!</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can access the\u00a0<strong>Source Code</strong>\u00a0from\u00a0<strong>my GitHub.</strong></p>\n\n<strong>Developer Note:\u00a0</strong>\n<p>This game has been developed in under 8 hours for Ludum Dare 52's Compo mode. I recorded how much time I spent on things: it's 1 hour of brainstorming, 3 hours and 30 minutes of coding, 1 hour and 15 minutes of designing and 1 hour and 30 minutes of doing other things like uploading to websites &amp; getting build.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I believe I'm quite decent at coding - but not so good at game design. So I would like you to criticize this prototype a bit more in terms of source code :) I didn't have much time to devote to this Ludum Dare, I could have only spent one day. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>I plan to add features like Shop and Undo sometime after Jam; and I will balance the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T10:45:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b8/8b870d0b2df979d9d820d626811ea138.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tzdevil"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
