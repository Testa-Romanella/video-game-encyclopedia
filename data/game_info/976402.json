My new video game, Membal, is a serene game filled with adorable animals, aiming to train memory while enjoying the construction of a small village.<br/>This game is truly important to me because the idea of a memory training game came to me when I was about 16, and my aunt was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I wanted to create a game to help her and others with memory issues. Perhaps it was naive and innocent, but I was genuinely focused on making it happen. Back then, I did almost all the art, but lacked the coding skills. After 5 years of developing my own games, I finally decided to finish it. I had to redo all the art, and now, I've finally brought it to life.<br/>Unfortunately, my aunt passed away two years ago. Therefore, I decided this game would be a tribute to her, making her one of the main characters assisting the player. I hope this game can help those in need and those seeking to enhance their memory and keep their minds active!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T06:25:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f50/f50bf4182dfd0a420f7252f874525d8c.jpg", "website": "https://www.gocagames.com/membal", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Goca Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Goca Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
