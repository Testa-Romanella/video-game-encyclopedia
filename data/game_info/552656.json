{"id": 552656, "slug": "mina-a-story-inbetween", "name": "Mina - A Story Inbetween", "name_original": "Mina - A Story Inbetween", "description": "<p>An 'old school' RPG, made with RPG Maker MV.</p>\n<p>A young man in search of power is taking on dangerous monsters and dragons to attain a legendary sword, said to hold unfathomable might.<br/>Why does he need it?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a young woman awakens in an unfamiliar castle. After her death, she encountered God himself, who tasked her with a mission, but this appears to be the wrong place for that...<br/>Confused about her situation, she sets out to find clues about her whereabouts.<br/><br/>These two stories will eventually connect, but who can say what will happen when they do?<br/></p>\n\n<p>Inspired by titles like the first Final Fantasy and early Dragon Quests, this game does not try to reinvent the wheel, but rather work and play with the concepts that made these old classics interesting compared to many newer iterations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>CTB Turn-System</p>\n<p>No questmaker - The story won't tell itself, you have to travel, discover, talk to people and rhyme together the lore of this world in order to find out what it even is you need to do.</p>\n<p>Full heal after every battle - Every battle is a life or death fight, no masses of random encounters to slay away on to grind exp</p>\n<p>No Game Over after death - this feature, just like the full heal system, was inspired by Final Fantasy 13. Mostly a quality of life thing in this case. Feel free to make mistakes and experiment without losing extra time over it.</p>\n<p>(Halfbaked) Class Sytem - Some characters have two classes they can choose from, both providing different skills for battle. Your level stays the same when switching jobs, so make use of this to pick the best skills for a specific fight.</p>\n<p>Limited number of overworld encounters - This makes battles - and therefore exp and money - a rare ressource that needs to be actively searched for, just like hidden treasure.</p>\n<p>(Mostly) open world - Without any story to tell you where to go, you are free to explore big parts of the world from the get go, of course only if you so choose. But be careful, strong monsters can be everywhere and they care little for your sense of exploration.</p>\n<p>All weapons are created equal - At least most of them. All weapons and armor have unique extra effects attached to them, which can also be upgraded. The stats of all equipment vary only slightly, making your equipments effects way more important when preparing for tough battles.</p>\n<p>Learn Skill from enemies - Similar to blue mages, your characters can learn certain skills just by watching an enemy using them against you. All Skills can also be learned from Level Up, but copying them from enemies often lets you attain them a lot earlier.</p>\n<p>No Teleportation / Overworld - I love how the first gen of Pokemon (if HM Fly wasn't a thing) and Dark Souls handeled this: Have a world that starts out rather linear but opens up over time with new keys and key items / moves, unlock shortcuts every now and then and end up with a big, interconnected world which paths double down on themselves. I tried for a similar approach, making it necessary to have an understanding of where you are, where you want to go and which way you have to get there over just using a Teleport spell.</p>\n<p>Limited, replenishing Items - Don't worry about hording items or guessing how many you need to buy anymore. Now you're always one short! But at least they refill after each battle.</p>\n<p>A real throwback to the old times - The game introduces a new use for elemental attacks for the battle system, but it is only briefly explained in the games tutorial. To fully grasp it you need to either experiment with it or read the manual. Amazing, isn't it? :hwink::hwink::hwink:</p>\n<p>Around 130 amazing, unique enemy designs, all drawn by be - in MS Paint... At work... Because I had nothing better to work with back then.</p>\n\n<p>Warning: There may be a few swear words popping up now and then, but those are rare exeptions.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:54:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea9/ea983ee1375ad97bdc8fd4af6219bbb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Midarn"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
