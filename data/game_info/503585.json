It\u2019s a rhythmic game where you only can move to the beat. You have to push stuffs, avoid things, etc. It\u2019s fun (and a bit hard).\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are <strong>7 levels</strong> to complete in order to beat (haha) the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Up/Down/Left/Right</strong> arrow to move</p>\n<p><strong>Press X </strong>to kill yourself and reset the level</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry for the absence of\u00a0music,I did not have any remaining time, so it\u2019s extremely annoying to just listen to the beat\u00a0:( but it\u2019s part of the all experience, right ? Oh, and it\u2019s kinda diffcult too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Anyway. Hope you\u2019ll enjoy.</p>\n\n\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare #47</p>\n<p>Made with PICO-8</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:11:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c7/3c781c0bbd1b6bdcb93bee04e8a82775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DotSquare"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
