(This description will be updated! But only tomorrow, because I really want to sleep...)<br/></p>\r\nAuthor's note\r\n<p>Making this game was HELL, literally. In the beginning, once we found these game jams, we decided to remake an old MS-Dos game called \"Operation Carnage\". For a while, everything worked out for us, but one day we saw that the time for one of the jams was almost over, and the game was not even half-done yet ... So we made a risky decision to completely remake the game for a remake of \"Crimsonland \", which was easier, but not without problems. As a result, in 2 days it turned out to roughly recreate the gameplay, cut out a large number of unfinished mechanics and glue the game together just a couple of hours before the feeling of sleep began to overcome our bodies. So yeah... it was fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T05:54:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c394c9b76d0f645544491492def77d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["BowieD", "SNeicer"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
