The game is very easy to learn; it will be love at first play! Simply rotate and place shapes into the grid to form solid connecting lines across or down. The solid lines are cleared leaving space to continue! Use your skills of organization and planning to ensure you never run out of space! Sounds easy? Give it a go! <br/><br/>The pure \"minimal\" puzzle gameplay is reminiscent of Tetris, but the game is more of a brain teaser than a fast paced arcade game. If you enjoy Bejeweled, Trism, thinking games like Sudoku, or my other game CornerChaos, you're sure to enjoy this too! <br/><br/>FEATURES: <br/>- Very simple to learn <br/>- 20 Levels to work through <br/>- Relaxed Mode (Take your time!) <br/>- Up to 74 different shapes! <br/>- Auto-save and auto-continue <br/>- Uses multi touch for rotations.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T05:29:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a6/5a66f2a8f3aaa05afa63e2444e38bee2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Paul Burkey"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Paul Burkey"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
