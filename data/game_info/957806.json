Unfortunately, the humans there really don't want that to happen.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys / WASD to move, Z / space to warp to a new zone.</p>\n<p>Eating moons increases your score. Be careful, because the moment you get close enough to a moon, it's inhabitants will start the ten second self-destruct countdown, to try to bring you down with it!<br/></p>\n<p>Every ten seconds you spend in the game either recharges your warp ability, or increases your multiplier if your warp is already charged. Warping resets your multiplier.<br/></p>\n<p>Be warned! Every ten seconds, each planet has a chance to spawn a slightly edible spaceship that hunts you down and fires at you. The longer you stay in a zone, you get more score, but the danger increases.</p>\n<p>Comets will fly at you quickly, and damage you, so be careful around them!</p>\n<p>Molten moons are moons in the early stages of forming, so they will be molten hot. They give you a lot of points, but also deal damage whenever you bite them.<br/></p>\n<p>See how far you can make it, before the spaceships overwhelm you.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game was created for Mini Jam 130: Lunar, all art, sound, and code was created during the game jam period.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T12:41:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf2/bf24b2f3a69a4b8ef948c9d10163c437.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SuperM7"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
