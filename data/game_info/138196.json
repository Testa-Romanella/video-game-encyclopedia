The theme of the Jam was dual or multi-purpose design, and I did my best to achieve it in the following ways:</p>\n<p>The hero's Pipe Wrench can be used to attack other characters, clear exits, defuse mushrooms, and repair the hero's health.</p>\n<p>The Food item can be given to characters for positive outcomes, or eaten by the hero to cure poison.</p>\n<p>The \"Keep Walking\" item is not used on the hero so it doesn't have a dual purpose in that way, but means something else for each character it is used on.</p>\n<p>The game is currently super-ultra-short, but is what I got done. I will reiterate on the concept in the future and make something much cooler... :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a08/a08915aef0a731c889af94bebb889390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andreas Express"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
