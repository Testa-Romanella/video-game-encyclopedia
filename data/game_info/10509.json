{"id": 10509, "slug": "freebie", "name": "Freebie", "name_original": "Freebie", "description": "<p>Freebie is a casual indie-style arcade where the player has to control a ball. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The aim is to accurately launch a ball against a rotating blue paddle so that the ball hits the green surface. It is presented as two bars at the edge of the square-shaped area.<br />\nThere are usually two green bars and two red bars; the red ones should not be touched. When the ball hits the green bars, the player earns points; when the ball hits the red ones, the player loses one health dot. There is a health bar - there are three of them - on the right of the area. The ball is launched from the left-side bottom angle and the right-side top angle. As time passes, the blue paddle starts to rotate faster, making it harder to play. Achieved points are shown as cards; the players can check out their positions on the leaderboard available for every user.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Freebie&#39;s area fits in an 8x10 frame. The game has no design or music settings; it does not change throughout the play. There are two levels: a normal mode, described above, and an epilepsy mode, which is harder to play. In this mode, the monochrome background changes, turning into a pool of colored squares. Developers state that those prone to epileptic seizures should avoid playing the epilepsy mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T10:49:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5e/a5ea2b82f47e23f5bd5c0c951b23f48d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.57, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 36, "owned": 955, "beaten": 7, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 46, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 46, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hyperboreanGames", "Free Games Info"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Back To Basics Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
