World is shrinking, time is running out and you need to find the other ships, weapons, protection and boosters before the others find you!... Or just hide in a nebula cloud until everybody else have destroyed each other.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is played with 2-4 players on the same computer with <strong>split-screen</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is highly suggested to use gamepads as some keyboards have limitations on how many keys that can be pressed simultaneously. This build only supports XInput compatible controllers. If you have an unsupported controller, consider getting Asteroid Arena from Steam as that version uses Steam input for controller support.<br/></p>\n<p>Not ready to buy the full game yet?
