For the most part, you have stopped the the flow of time and restart it at will. However, the facility you are in is\u00a0about to explode. As you let time flow, the clock winds down. You have\u00a0<em><strong>10 seconds</strong></em> to reach the switch that stops the bomb, or\u00a0you die and have to start from the beginning. Let's see how well you fare.</p>\n<p>The game was inspired by RPI's Monthly Game Jam. I couldn't attend this month, so I couldn't really participate, but I was too inspired by the jam's theme \"10 seconds\" to pass up the opportunity. This game has exactly 0 minutes of playtesting, so let me know what you think! Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T05:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cad/cadc3b5c539ecadfc5addc4ed46c55d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QCortex07"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
