With a lovingly rendered cartoon aesthetic, beautiful Spine-based animations, witty writing, and a full rich soundscape, Grumpy Witch seeks to cheer and entertain. The game has bulletproof and precise platformer physics hearkening back to yesteryear, and careful attention to detail to focus on bringing the fun to the foreground of play.<br/><br/><strong>Developed with Love.
