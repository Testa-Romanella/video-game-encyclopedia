Consume <strong>Food Pickups</strong> littered across the tracks to power up your critter. Unleash your food power as gaseous turbo boost or leave it behind as a gift to mess with your opponents. Turbo Tails features a unique handling mechanic where taking on food increases your weight, in turn reducing your <strong>maneuverability</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>Compete in a <strong>variety of environments</strong>, from twisty trails to muddy meadows. Featuring challenging <strong>track hazards</strong> such as river crossings, slippery fruit trails, wandering machines and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Eat food littered around the track to gain <strong>Turbo</strong> boost. The more you eat, the stronger the Turbo! Save up a bunch of food for a long straight and leave the competition behind in a cloud of gas. Use your Turbo boost to create shortcuts or obtain those harder to reach pickups.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Be careful not to consume too much though, as eating will reduce handling. Players will need to be mindful of the track layout when choosing whether to top up on food, else they may find themselves too heavy to make the next turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Alternatively, if you do find yourself overloaded, you may wish to offload all of your food in a pinch to reduce your weight, which can also serve as a nice gift to your opponents, sending them sliding off the track!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Choose from a variety of animal athletes, such as <strong>Cow</strong>, <strong>Goat</strong> and who could forget <strong>Sheep</strong>. Don't forget to unlock the special critter and show off to your friends!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Races can be enjoyed in <strong>multiple modes:</strong><br/><ul><li>Single Player<br/></li><li>4 Player Versus<br/></li><li>Online Multiplayer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T06:03:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae5/ae57e53c058927b82c257c17b313ed41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hardy Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hardy Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
