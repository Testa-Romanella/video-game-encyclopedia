That's also why some well known functions have not been implemented - I simply did not have a better idea how to make it differently :-).<br/><br/>It's not Early Access, because, with some minor exceptions related to fine tuning and bugs, the game is already fully playable as it is.<br/><br/>Please check also the game requirements - optimization of the game was not the top priority (with that, I would have to sacrifice some features).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Storyline</strong><br/><br/>CitiesCorp means that a corporation is taking over the responsibility \u2013 so in fact, there are no majors, just CEOs. Your corporation takes care about housing, jobs, products and its own profits. In return, there are no taxes \u2013 neither to the corporation nor to the population. <br/><br/><br/><strong>What Is In? What Can Be Played Today?</strong><br/><br/>- Map That Is Equivalent to 10km X 10km,<br/>- Scale Buildings,<br/>- Shape Buildings,<br/>- Numerous In-game Building Textures,<br/>- Creating building complexes through a simple and effective overlapping system, <br/>- Multiple building functionalities (e.g. appartments, offices, shops, factories in one building), <br/>- Challenging economy with hundreds of products to be produced and sold, <br/>- Flexible street building system, <br/>- Street signs and lightning for coping with traffic jams. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>What Is Not In (yet)?</strong><br/><br/>- Mainly things that can be already played in other similar games - in case there will be a great idea to do it \"differently\", it will be implemented<br/><br/>    - Public buildings, e.g. police, schools, hospitals etc. <br/>    - Landscapes - at the moment it is just a flat land, <br/>    - Public transport, e.g. trains, busses etc., <br/>    - Curvy roads, <br/>    - Tax system \u2013 and do not even ask for it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78d492a9aaeb465c3e5fb2d7e9d0b338.jpg", "website": "http://www.citiescorp.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SaintWorks"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SaintBunny"], "esrb_rating": null}
