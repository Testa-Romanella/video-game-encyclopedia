To us, it so often feels like extremism is everywhere, misinformation dominates fact, and the interests of the rich and powerful are the only ones that seem to matter. Asymmetric polarization came to a head last year when right-wing insurrectionists lead a violent riot through the United States' capitol, and no one in power did anything to stop them. We wanted to reflect our thoughts on the attempted coup by imagining an alternate history, building a similar event with similar meanings and politics, and then placing ourselves at the center of it to examine our feelings and reactions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T17:41:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ecf20f2549b4400aea5147bdb7871fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Middle Isle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
