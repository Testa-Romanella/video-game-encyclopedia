My aim for this year is to carry over my Ph.D. research about procedurally generated terrains into my game. I aim to capture 150 years of racing in a game one day.<br/><br/><br/>Motorbike Evolution is a multiplayer racing game that uses principles similar to those of World of Tanks. With each race against 39 other players, you gain experience and credits, for which you can buy various upgrades for your vehicle or unlock newer vehicles. You start with machines from the 1900s. Can you get to the very top and ride on modern machinery?<br/><br/><br/>Controls are simplified enough to give you still the passion of riding but not too complex to take you hours to learn. It mainly focuses on providing players with the best enjoyment from racing fights. The game's core is short, dynamic races with a high action density. The feeling from the ride is very reminiscent of older games; do not expect a hardcore simulator. On the other hand, it's not a mario kart racing game - there are physics, and you need to keep that in mind.<br/><br/><br/>- 80 motorbikes from 120 years of history<br/>- 40 real and custom tracks<br/>- 1000+ various vehicle setups<br/>- 30+ vehicle patterns, each customizable<br/>- 10 different biomes<br/><br/><br/>Using a simple yet rich customization system, you can customize your vehicle and rider as much as you want. For example, you can paint your motorbikes with any combination of colors or use any of the available patterns to customize them!<br/><br/><br/>The game is based on custom cloud-saving technology. As part of that, it contains many classic MMO features like cloud save, leaderboards, daily missions, achievements, and stats! Compare yourself to other racers!<br/><br/><br/><strong>DISCORD COMMUNITY (4,200+ MEMBERS)</strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T07:39:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/662/66227a3cb204a20a1fb845731cdac83c.jpg", "website": "https://www.engineevolution.eu/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 466, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petr \u0160im\u016fnek"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Petr \u0160im\u016fnek"], "esrb_rating": null}
