{"id": 375205, "slug": "boc", "name": "BOC", "name_original": "BOC", "description": "<strong>BOC</strong>\u00a0is a realistic historical turn-based 4X strategy game. Unique features like 360\u00ba realistic worlds on a global scale are brought to life by our performance-focused multiplatform engine, hardcore tactical components, and climate simulation. Our approach will take players through the ancient world, starting in the Ice Age (55.000 B.C) up until to era of great ancient empires and the fall of the Western Roman Empire.<h3>MAIN FEATURES</h3><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>A vast world to build</strong>; We achieved a global scale in our scenarios, from micro maps 8x8 up to 512x384, which is more than 196.000 hexagonal tiles. this breaks the current world record by three times, bringing a huge expansion world for plays, due to the size of our maps, exploring will be different, we won't have a fog of war because units\u2019 sight will be limited literally by the Earth\u2019s curvature, yes, our maps have exactly same earth's curvature!</li></ul><br/><ul><li><strong>Realistic Worlds</strong>, from the beginning our effort has been focused on achieving realistic terrain &amp; geography, as well as creating gorgeous landscapes within a 4X context. We have developed our own program shaders to achieve these realistic visuals.<br/><br/>The game engine technology for the generation of the world map is based on realistic simulations. The worlds of BOC are divided into circles of latitude like the real world, which will determine the type of terrain, as well as the amount of sunlight, temperature, and weather.</li></ul><br/><ul><li><strong>Climatic simulation &amp; Dynamic environments system</strong>; A world that will change progressively as time goes by. These changes in the environment will also make an impact on the terrain. All factors of terrain like height and biome will have a tactical weight. We are working very hard to provide great immersive worlds to play in. The climate and environment simulation are fundamental; your terrain bonus and features are strongly determined by climate and environment simulations.</li></ul><br/><ul><li><strong>We offer a progression system that gives complete freedom in how to expand and progress your civilizations[/u]</strong>, akin to some RPG non-linear progression paths. In BOC, unlike other strategy games where the player chooses a particular faction, what we have is a sandbox-like combination of progression and cultures. At the beginning of the game, under your command you will only have a tiny nomadic tribe.</li></ul><br/><ul><li><strong>Literally, you will be able to feel your army</strong>, one of the things that make our project stand from the crowd is that we have decided to offer a 4X world in which you can actually feel that you have an army, not just mere board game pieces, Our technology provides a large capacity of game entities for battles, officially there is no limit.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T02:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b26/b26fe7c15996f816cd7e4d66a532e7ac.jpg", "website": "https://bocproject.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Code::Arts"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Code::Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
