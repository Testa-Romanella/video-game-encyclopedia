The project is a part of KixStarter 2022, with the prompt \u201cBreak the Rules\u201d and it is built in the Godot engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The team wanted to create a playful but challenging sidescroller heavily influenced by 1960s Looney Tunes cartoons and Campy Vampire themes.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game centers around Dorf, a dumpy, hapless custodian at a B.L.U.D. (Bio Lab Undead Detainment) Corp. facility. On one graveyard shift, the tempting captive vampire queen Elvy proves too alluring to Dorf, and he allows her to get a little too close. With new powers pulsing through his veins and the ability to transform into a bat at will, Dorf must now race to escape a facility full of deadly vampire killing traps - UV lights, exploding crates, pits of acidic garlic sauce and the ever present ACME anvil of doom.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The player controls slow moving man-Dorf with WASD, while the SPACEBAR transforms him into bat-Dorf, whose movement follows the mouse. Some traps are deadly only to Dorf as a man, others to his bat form, while some kill all his forms.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T11:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d0cc265d17f7730bc7dd52b4c384fe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VengantMjolnir"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
