Pillage mode is included along with\u00a0with 3 set runes, however\u00a0some of the features mentioned below like settlement building won't be playable until early/full release.</em><br/><br/><strong>What is ShieldMaidens?</strong></p>\n<p>ShieldMaidens is a solo/co-op endless runner where you have to fight and block your way through enemies, but be on your toes as you also may encounter more elite enemies who require quick wits and reactions to defeat. If you\u2019re unable to beat them on your first try, you can return to your settlement and construct buildings that unlock useful\u00a0upgrades, weapons, runes or potions for getting back out there!</p>\n<p><strong>How do I fight and improve?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Every player holds a shield, but your secondary weapon is up to you! Charge in with a sword or hang back with\u00a0 a bow. Second to this, you can attach runes to your shield granting extra powers and abilities - mix &amp; match these to alongside your chosen weapon to find a play-style that suits you best\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Patch notes:</strong><br/>https://github.com/Pang/ShieldMaidens_PatchNotes</p><p><strong>Discord:\u00a0<br/></strong>https://discord.gg/AaSS4vDRg4</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>YouTube:<br/></strong><em>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBX3-GA3ocMWZf-VuY7HV4g</em><br/><strong><br/>The current roadmap:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>More boss fights and unique characters</li><li>More runes &amp; abilities</li><li>More randomly spawned map parts<br/>\n</li><li>A wider array of non-elite\u00a0enemies</li><li>Increase local multiplayer capacity &amp; controller selection</li><li>More\u00a0weapons\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:52:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b09/b09a57b75da10b443a621a10518678f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PangDev"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
