With that rocket, Mike can finally figure out what is really going on up on the Moon.<br/><br/>Mine and collect minerals. Be careful not to take too much damage, otherwise all of Mike's hard-work will be all for nothing. When Mike's inventory is full, sell his findings at the local General Store.<br/><br/><br/>Alternatively, you can take Mike's iron and coal over to the local Smeltery. With a couple of coins and a little time, Mike can turn that useless iron ore into iron bars. Furthermore, those iron bars can be turned into steel bars. Technology has really gone beyond comprehension.<br/><br/><br/>Sell Mike's new alloys at the store for a little bit more of a profit. Or, Mike can donate his iron and steel bars into rocket development. Eventually, Mike might be able to make it to the moon, to find out what's really going on up there.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d90a6d34a00fee869f3b6dea65199c89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedRoket Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["RedRoket Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
