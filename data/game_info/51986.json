Much of everything she\u2019s done has been an attempt to find some semblance of security, including the career path she chose to pursue. Kikka works as an official guard for one of the many tiny villages in the region. Her most recent assignment is to travel with fellow guard Bemelle to an allied town that\u2019s been under siege by raiders.<br/><br/>With an ever-present sense of urgency, the two find themselves on the shore of Sinnlos, a cursed lake of black water that is home to the Nixi; twisted creatures who take joy in drowning humans. The two need the assistance of a nameless guide to even attempt to cross the maze of bridges spanning the dark waters. But they are not the only ones seeking passage that night. The guide agrees to lead them all, whilst also giving a warning that a group this large has no chance of making it across whole. Someone will be lost along the way. None of them volunteer to stay behind, regardless. And so the ill-fated journey over the lake of voices begins.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-25T19:39:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce65c483fd5349bc4218f5709e8b4056.jpg", "website": "https://gb-patch.tumblr.com/up", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 49, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GB Patch Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GB Patch Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
