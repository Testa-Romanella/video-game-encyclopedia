For University, our prompt for this was 'Gift a Game' and around Christmas time, I decided I\u00a0wanted to do this for my partner. There is huge emphasis on keeping busy while apart so you can enjoy 'home' together, albeit short - this is the first game I\u00a0have ever completed fully and has a working crafting system. I\u00a0hope you enjoy the journey to building Heekki as much as I\u00a0did, have a great day!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T13:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ae/6ae10410ba7e8796480de99ae9ad265f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JarlReidy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
