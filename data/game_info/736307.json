About how unimportant actions can affect the big picture. At the beginning of the game you find yourself as a demiurge lord, controlling the masses of the population, choosing its fate as ruler. Only in the course of the game, when you get to control it on a human level, can you find out the reasons that moved the people to the actions depicted in the game.<br/><br/>Music by composers Kirill Arkhipov and Ivan Napreenko will enhance the feeling of the game<br/><br/>\"Crowd Sign: Emission interprets the mechanisms of authoritarianism. The viewer becomes the controller of a virtual crowd in real time. An order in the form of a clear graphic symbol is sent to a semi-organized thousand-headed image. But the creatures living on the far side of the screen never follow orders in strict compliance. Due to the complexity of the communication system, the sent signal undergoes alteration, reminding us that power cannot be unlimited.\"<br/>                        - Alexei Shulgin, contemporary artist, musician, and online curator", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-17T13:52:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6f/e6f2d72a3a6d70ced85e3362fd4f1dd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 394, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mikhail Maksimov"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dying.Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
