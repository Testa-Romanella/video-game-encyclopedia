The idea is that every iteration of the game is finished and releasable. This doesn't mean the game has an ending, but it means that it is playable in the biggest sense of the word (you can do <em>something</em>).\u00a0The game simply isn't done until I say it is, but you get access to every development iteration. This is mostly in effort to get myself to finish a game.\u00a0Thank you for understanding.</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys to move the camera<br/></p><p>More information will follow later, when the game has reached a later stage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:23:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70a582763aaa38139b64759fec3e81c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["digaly"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
