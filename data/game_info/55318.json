The player assumes the role of \"Officer Bob,\" a rookie police officer. As Bob, players drive around the city, ticketing motorists for minor infractions and pulling over more serious offenders. Eventually, players must apprehend criminals for which an all-points bulletin has been called.</p>\n<p>The arcade cabinet was created to look like a police car, with a gas pedal, steering wheel and a siren button, complete with flashing lights atop the unit. The game's cartoonish visuals and sense of humor gained it positive reviews. However, the game was slightly criticized for its difficulty; the game's developers later admitted that a long development cycle had resulted in the gameplay growing more complicated than originally planned.</p>\n<p>APB was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum in 1989. A version for the Atari Lynx handheld was published later, in 1991.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61cd83b02d4c6ef12f9b3273d2248143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Atari Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": null}
