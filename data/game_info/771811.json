{"id": 771811, "slug": "tiny-submarine", "name": "Tiny Submarine", "name_original": "Tiny Submarine", "description": "<p>To fit the theme, \"One action at a time,\" I made a game about managing a small, one-person submarine. There are several stations on the submarine that require your attention, but you can only attend to one at a time. Try to stay afloat as you look for treasure beneath the sea and avoid the obstacles and sea creatures that might damage your ship and cause you to sink.<br/></p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Looking around</strong><br/>Press A and D to look left and right.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Navigation</strong><br/>Click the arrow buttons on your navigation system to direct the submarine. It will move continuously in the direction it is set to. Hitting a red dot on the sonar will damage your submarine, but going over a green dot will earn you a point.</p>\n<p><strong>Windows</strong><br/>There are three windows on this submarine. If any sea creatures approach the window, click on it to shoo them away. If they latch onto the ship they will damage it.</p>\n<p><strong>Leaks</strong><br/>Taking damage will cause leaks to appear on your ship. Click on a leak to patch it up. You lose when the ship fills to the top with water.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T07:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80da1b0d23925c10d3e9da546f4478fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Darien"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
