It even has some of your old games around! You should totally play some of those.</p>\n<p>Oh...that's unfortunate. Looks like it's on its last legs. Your screen is failing. Well, you should still play as much as you can before you can't see what's going on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here's a list of the games you can choose from:</p>\n<p>Party Snek: A classic. Run around get food before you run into the wall (or yourself).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just a Hedgehog 2: Not as good as the original, but still okay. You run around and shoot ghosts. Pretty straightforward.</p>\n<p>It's Bomb Time: The robot towers shoot at you and you have to avoid their bullets. Use your bombs to protect yourself and temporarily knock them out of commission. I don't remember those white bombs. Maybe you should try those where your screen is failing.</p>\n<p>Slime Stomp: This is a take on a whack-a-mole game. Hit the slimes before they escape. Let too many get away and you lose!</p>\n<p>Credits: I'm not sure what this is. Weird. Definitely check it out.</p>\n<p>Title Screen: Another weird looking one. You should start with that one.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys: Push the d-Pad</p>\n<p>Space bar/enter: Push the A button</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T16:36:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b06527146a64c3de250fb219026736bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A-Flat Miner Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
