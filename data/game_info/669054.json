{"id": 669054, "slug": "sonmare", "name": "Sonmare", "name_original": "Sonmare", "description": "<p>Sonmare is an interactive musical adventure exploring three ocean environments and how their soundscapes are threatened by climate change and other human activity. The viewer wears a VR headset and is seated at a keyboard-type MIDI controller (or computer keyboard) which they use to interact with the piece. Playing along with an originally composed score, the viewer will bring life back to a bleached coral reef, illuminate the dark crevasses of Antarctic sea ice, and soar through the open ocean with a pod of humpback whales.</p>\n<p>Player interactions bring light, colour and sound to these worlds and accompany the unique rhythms and visuals occurring in each area. Sonmare is available for PC with Oculus Rift + MIDI keyboard or computer keyboard, and for Oculus Quest 2 + hand tracking.</p>\n<p>Sonmare was produced as part of the 2020\u00a0New Creatives initiative,\u00a0supported by Arts Council England and BBC Arts.\r\n</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Alyssa T.
