This time it's ugly, horrendous and despicable bugs trying to take over the house at an unstoppable rate, it\u2019s survival as these bugs\u2019 main mission is to go for your fridge, your only source of food while in lock-down. It will be a difficult task from letting these menaces breach into your home that's why you've got traps and collectables\u00a0to stop these bugs in their path.<br/></p>\n<p>Being shrunk to a similar size to the bugs, the main character faces a challenge that is to overcome the invasion as the house is now a completely different perspective. Each room in the house is now huge and the character has to now adventure around the room fighting off the bugs then facing a boss, each room has a boss also defeating will result in a collectable item. Collectable items are all over the game which the player can find by guiding the character in secret or hidden locations, this includes small parkour extras or hidden trap doors or rooms that could be possibly accessed by moving objects or breaking a block that triggers a door to open.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This adventure may seem simple to these bugs but little do they know that you are prepared and have turned the house into a fortress with all sorts of crazy weapons ranging from water balloons to an electric fly swatter to a huge flamethrower! Defence mechanisms include trigger-action mines that release poisonous gas or a huge fan slowing down the speeds and progression of the breaching bugs. If the defence doesn\u2019t go to plan and the bugs swarm all the food in the house it is officially game over and you have failed to protect your essentials. An all-out defence is required to defeat the creatures and to survive these vicious waves of attacks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:04:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ee/8ee999fcb6728a54dca8ac863e9b2d70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ijacome29"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
