That's it!</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>in Version v.051, the Player plays only as the Alien.</p>\n<p>Next update will allow the Player access to the Kitty character after so many points. Ths Censored Character will be a tbd\u00a0Unlock.</p>\n<p>Updates will come on no predetermined schedule, as this project is a creator's diversion project.\u00a0If anyone would like to \u00a0see it developed further, please let me know!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a2/9a2696ed34184cda02d20ac226b5a4cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["POTUS"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
