Buy guns, use your abilities, and kill all the cops in your path. Be the first to make millions doing the jobs others are too scared to do. In this fast paced game there is no winner, but there is the richest player.\u00a0\u00a0This game was inspired by: Payday 2, Hotline Miami, and some MOBA games such as League of Legends which is were the abilities come from.</p>\n<p>I am currently working on a Trello Page for the game. When I finish the page I will announce it.</p>\r\nPrice Tag:\r\n<p>I want the community to be able to make a good price tag for the game, but I also would like to recommend a tag which is $5.00 or more. As soon as I have the money that I need to release the game on Steam I will set up the page and the game will be there instead of here. You will still be able to play the game, you will just need to play it through Steam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T04:26:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/868/8681c897b22da089c38af5cdffc6e6d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["R8ZER"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
