As the number of eliminated lines increases, the minefield will grow faster, making the game more hard and exciting.<br/>There are three difficulties in the game: Easy, Normal and Hard. You can also customize the size of the board and the number of mines through shortcut keys.<br/>When the game is over, the player's score will be recorded in the high score list so that they can compete with other players.<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>Right-clicking will mark the square as a question mark instead of a flag. Only when the square is absolutely certain that there are no mines will it be marked as a flag, e.g. left click on a mine.<br/>You can mark a square as flag by right clicking on the number around it, you don't have to click left and right buttons simultaneously.<br/>When you right-click the number, the game will automatically and intelligently mark the flag according to the situation of marked, unmarked squares and mines.<h3>Feature</h3><br/>The in-game help will teach you the methods, rules and techniques of minesweeping with illustrations.<br/>The hidden AI system can automatically clear mines, helping you understand and learn the process of minesweeping.<br/>The built-in music in the game can also help you relieve nervous tension during the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T22:47:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48ca1dffcb91bace31b049999de606ce.jpg", "website": "https://github.com/axpokl/MineSweeperTetris", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ax_pokl"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["ax_pokl"], "esrb_rating": null}
