The game is meant to have you, the player, play the role as the one in charge of the animals. You handle one pet at a time with options on how to care for them. Each pet will have different backstories of why they have come into your care. In the game, each pet has a link to their direct foster page where\u00a0you can learn about Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society (PAWS).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created for the Philly 24 Hour Recovery Game Jam and we decided to support PAWS. Our goal is to bring awareness to the many animals that are left in foster care who are looking for loving homes after recovering from their past. Be sure to check out PAWS for more information of their many other foster pets!</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer/Project Lead:</strong> Judie Thai / @judie_thai</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Artist:</strong> moaw / @moawko</p>\n<p><strong>Script Writer/Researcher:</strong> Celeste Cottrell / @theactualcel</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing Tiny House!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T02:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd9/cd9bb207430f0e1934d6e3970ffbcb50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["moawling", "judiethai", "Cel C."], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
