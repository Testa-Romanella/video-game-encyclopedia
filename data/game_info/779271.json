Headphones are strongly recommended for playing!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Somehow you got yourself stuck in the dreaded labyrinth of failing graphic cards, where ancient magic also known under the name of bad code prevents the rendering of all light sources. Trying to escape this eternal darkness, you remember that, conveniently, you were raised by bats and your nocturnal, but nonetheless loving foster parents taught you the secrets of echolocation. So, there should be nothing to be worried about... or is there? (SPOILER: There is. It is a monster. But at least no jumpscares or loud noises.)</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Try to avoid the monster and find the exit of the labyrinth through navigating by ear. To facilitate navigation, the player can only move on a 4-connected grid. There are multiple auditory clues scattered across the level to indicate your current location. You can also use echolocation by sending out a wave of sound.\u00a0After some time, you will hear an echo, coming from the direction of the exit. The delay of the echo depends on the distance between you and the exit.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>W to move forward one space</li><li>A to turn 90\u00b0 to the left</li><li>D to turn 90\u00b0 to the right</li><li>Space to use echolocation</li><li>F3 to unblock the vision</li></ul>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:43:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc1/cc12c1b49dada82e8cbd60b036b0fa52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tianmaru"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
