Using photogrammetry and laser scanning techniques, we have created a way to create precise digital twins of the masterpieces of world art you see in the app. You can even touch, zoom and examine the artworks from all sides. In virtual space, you can hold an item (which is not allowed in a real museum) or get up close to unique paintings, so close that they can see the texture of each touch of the genius\u2019s brush.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNon-traditional exhibition galleries are another feature of MalovMetaArt. Here you may admire glass artworks exhibited under the starry sky of faraway planets, as well as masterpieces of painting in a subway hall of mid-20th century.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMany of us don't frequently visit regular museums. So, give a go to a virtual one. You'll like it. Furthermore, MalovMetaArt Metaverse is better and more convenient than a traditional museum in many aspects.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T03:36:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c947c0fedc1f9cb5c291a905fe73ad9.jpg", "website": "https://malovmeta.art/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Malov Meta Art"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Malov Meta Art"], "esrb_rating": null}
