(if you are a Spee D. Reader)<br/><br/>But why go fast? Breath in, and inhale the EXQUISITE memes in /Conspiracy/ Girls!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Madison Delaroux, the [Exposer of Conspiracies] has finally come back to New Coimbra. Dragging her accomplices, Ayano and Sachiko along, she seeks to expose (((Those))) who seek to rule the New Continent in secret!<br/><br/>Fed up with Madison's meddling, glowie agents and secret cultists have teamed up to rid themselves of the [Exposer] once and for all...! Will (((they))) succeed in party vanning her, or will Madison eternally BTFO those-who-glow-in-the-dark with no rematch?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Domo, domo, Author-kun des.<br/><br/>It's finally here. More than a year after the demo, /Conspiracy/ Girls is out. In the year I worked on my visual novel, it morphed from my original vision of a C***** P**** tragedy to its current slice-of-life of a comedy featuring cunny and conspiracies (laugh). Madison is still exposing (((them))), Ayano is still denying the existence of conspiracies, but their circle of friends (?) is larger now, so their (((enemies))) have grown in number as well.<br/><br/>What hasn't changed are the feelings that made me write this gigantic shitpost of a visual novel. To quote a fellow author, \"I wrote this for those who are like me.\" And as events in the last few years have revealed, there are a great deal of those who are not our kind of people. Even if you told them the ex-president is reading their emails, or that the government takes in cute girl orphans and turns them into killers in school uniform, they wouldn't bat an eye. Among other things.<br/><br/>I think my technique has greatly improved over the past year! The original /Conspiracy Girls/ pilot looks so oddly antiquated compared to &gt;Madness. If anything, &gt;Madness is good for a laugh! I know I was laughing a lot when I put in all the little secrets inside the book, so I hope you will too. I found myself rereading the cute girls doing cute things parts to cheer myself up whenever the glowies decide to turn their 5G towers in my direction, so I know it's good!<br/><br/>And above all, I would like to thank the people who worked with me for &gt;Madness, especially my artists in Stefan, Kat, ruvikvik, Fachru and k_uaci. I probably gave them hell as art director, with some really impossible requests along the way, but if it weren't for them, the characters wouldn't have turned out as pretty as they did.<br/><br/>I also chose a large selection of comedic music from Kevin Macleod and Alexander Nakarada, who I consider both to be the fathers of internet music, you probably have heard their work before (monkeysspinningmonkeys.mp3) but never realized it. They are really talented musicians, and many a sleepless night was spent listening to their tunes while trying to get a scene right. A full list of tracks is listed inside the game's ending credits.<br/><br/>And lastly, I wrote this for the witch who taught me to write. It's been many years since I first met her. I've also since stopped yelling her name in front of her portrait. There are very little people who would hide an entire treatise on magickal theory within a mystery novel, but I understood her message. This book is my message bottle to you. Perhaps by some small miracle you will read this and go \"hah\" with narrow eyes as we used to do when we were younger.<br/><br/>I've said all that I can say, <strong>buy /Conspiracy/ Girls</strong>! If my little isekai into this world doesn't work out, there's always wageslaving at a meido cafe somewhere!<br/><br/>Laugh, it's fun!<br/>Arthur Delaroux", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T05:43:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc4ec742f82c3098aec53ef216893587.jpg", "website": "https://housedelaroux.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["House Delaroux"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["House Delaroux"], "esrb_rating": null}
