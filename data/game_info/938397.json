Genesis embodies a serene, pastel-colored environment, while Onyx navigates a harsh, scorching landscape, fraught with challenges and danger.</p>\n<p>Although the game is not yet fully complete, it already boasts an exciting blueprint, highlighting the collection of coins by Genesis and Onyx. Additionally, I have plans to expand the game with a larger map, featuring menacing foes that Genesis and Onyx must overcome as they progress through their journey. Players will have the opportunity to upgrade their characters, enabling them to fend off increasingly powerful enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>Another exciting feature in the works is a time trial mode, where players can compete to achieve the fastest completion time. In due course, I plan to create my own cast of unique characters to add to the game's depth and complexity.\r\n</p>\n<p>I am proud to say that this game is entirely of my own creation, and I have successfully developed a Menu, UI, and sound that enhance the overall experience. The parallax background and platform were meticulously designed on Figma, and the current characters are assets from ARKS.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Music belongs to:\u00a0VOID1Gaming</p>\n<p>Although I completed the game in under a week, I intend to invest more time in its development, refining its mechanics and expanding its scope. Your feedback is vital, and I urge you to leave a comment that can help me enhance the gameplay experience. Thank you for playing, and I hope you enjoy the game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T10:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3e7d4c155ec283d0083ba8d75fd07f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raygatsby"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
