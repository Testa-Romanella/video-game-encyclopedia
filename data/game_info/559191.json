Archeologists uncovered game boards, but the rules for the game remained a mystery. In the early 1980s, Irving Finkel, a curator at the British Museum, translated a cuneiform tablet that revealed the rules for the game.<br/><br/>When it's your turn, tap on the piece you want to move or on the square you wish to move to. Pieces are moved one square for each die that lands with a white spot showing. The goal is to be the first player to move all of their pieces through the course. If your token lands on a square marked with a rosette, you get another turn. If your piece lands on your opponent's piece, you send it back to the start. A piece on the center rosette is safe from capture.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-18T14:58:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32a/32aa8a1243d037992b0c2d5110fbb42f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mike Green"], "genres": ["Racing", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Mike Green"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
