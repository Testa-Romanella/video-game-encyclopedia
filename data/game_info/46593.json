In this space themed building game you get to solve increasingly challenging remote-operated missions, as you climb the corporational ladder and unlock new planets.<br/><br/>The building mode is intuitive and unrestricted. There\u2019s only a few carefully designed basic parts, and by combining them it\u2019s possible to do all kinds of mechanical systems: steering, hydraulics, suspension systems, to name a few. <br/><br/>The missions begin by teleporting to the destination. Once there you have to either collect and bring back supply boxes, or travel to a different telepad in a challenging terrain. There might also be man-made obstacles on the way that you have to either destroy or get past somehow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/> \u2022  3d building mode with 10 different parts/materials<br/> \u2022  Rover Gallery, in which you can save your designs for future use<br/> \u2022  Career mode with 2 planets and 16 missions (more to come!)<br/><br/>This game is in Early Access, which means it\u2019s still a bit rough around the edges, and there might be some bugs or incomplete features. By buying the game and giving valuable feedback you\u2019ll be helping us greatly to get this game ready!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02d/02d02534b10a364c53ec2c237710c908.jpg", "website": "https://www.roverbuilder.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hatfuls Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hatfuls Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
