{"id": 126336, "slug": "mountains-of-fire", "name": "Mountains Of Fire", "name_original": "Mountains Of Fire", "description": "<p>\r\n\tThis split-screen game shows the 3D world from two different perspectives:\r\n</p><ol>\n<li>a worm, swimming in hot lava, and </li>\n<li>a human, carefully walking over the rocky surface. </li>\n</ol><p>\r\n\t Together, they cooperate to reach a safe place within the mountains flooded with lava. The game can be played by two players, or by a single player controlling both human and sandworm simultaneously. The controls were designed to be reachable by a single player.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tControls and hints how to play:\r\n</p><ol>\n<li>Human views the world in 1st person. It walks over the terrain. In right-handed mode, human view is the right one. Human is controlled only with mouse. Move mouse to look around. Click mouse left button to start/stop moving forward (no need to hold the button pressed), Click mouse right button to start/stop moving backward (no need to hold the button pressed). Human is hurt by hot lava. Stand on a neutral ground (rocks) to regenerate, or very close to the worm when it freezes the lava (on blueish fluid). When the human dies, game ends. </li>\n<li>Worm views the world from the top. It can swim in lava. In right-handed mode, worm view is the left one. Move the worm with AWSD. Worm freezes lava into a water that is not harmful for player. Worm is hurt when it stays stationary for too long, as the heat is too much even for a sandworm. You have to move the worm to regenerate. When the worm dies, human can still try to continue the game. </li>\n</ol><p>\r\n\tHints:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Worm is visible in both views, even when it's obscured by a wall etc. If you're lost, human can look around, and see where the worm is. </li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tMiscellaneous keys:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>F5 takes a screenshot. </li>\n<li>Escape exit. </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/153/15392f60a80c07f01c87326ee9820ace.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Michalis Kamburelis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
