{"id": 10533, "slug": "path-of-exile", "name": "Path of Exile", "name_original": "Path of Exile", "description": "<p>Path of Exile is inspired by Diablo II and follows it basically in most of the aspects. Randomly filled pre-set of locations, heavy grind and a possibility of replaying most of the areas leaves us with only one possible outcome. </p>\n<p>Players wake up on grim shores of Wraeclast. Without any knowledge who we are or what have we done, players must start to explore an aggressive and cruel fantasy world of criminals, bandits and murderers. Discover the mystery of a long forgotten the Eternal Empire, and survive.</p>\n<p>Mechanics are pretty simple. Choose one of six different classes, gather gems for more skills to use and grind good and synergising equipment. Due to replaying, you can grind any needed equipment or resources to buy it from vendors. Infinite loop of gameplay will still be challenging. The cooperative mode allows beating the game with a party of friends up to six people at the same time.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2013-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T22:10:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d0f/d0f91fe1d92332147e5db74e207cfc7a.jpg", "website": "http://www.pathofexile.com", "rating": 3.65, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 325, "owned": 7907, "beaten": 294, "toplay": 100, "dropped": 1058, "playing": 181}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 317, "ratings_count": 1581, "suggestions_count": 583, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1591, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Grinding Gear Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Grinding Gear Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
