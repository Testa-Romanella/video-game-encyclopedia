He has money, power, a butler whose sole existence is to ensure James\u2019 success. Nothing stands in the way of his meteoric rise to further prestige and fortune.</p>\n<p>Well, until <em>you</em> came along. It\u2019s time to show James that he can\u2019t buy his way into winning the science fair\u2026even if it takes some underhanded experimenting. <br/></p>\n<p>Science Fair Sabotage is a point-and-click puzzle game made by Trash Otter Studio, a group of first-timers at the Seattle Indie Game Jam, where the theme was \"Intentionally Broken.\" Combine ingredients found in the classroom to sabotage (dare we say, intentionally break) James\u2019 experiments and knock him down a peg. The game is for all ages, but is not recommended for those sensitive to trickery, classism, science, and potential arson. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Contributors: <br/></p>\n<p>Alec McQuinn - Programming and Writing\u00a0</p>\n<p>Annie Bradshaw - Art and Design\u00a0</p>\n<p>Greg Watson - Music Composition\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ishin Iwasaki - Programming and Writing\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nora Swindle - Music Composition \u00a0and C4 Queen\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Guest Starring Andrew McPherson as James (Once that's in the game) <br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T02:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9a0618fb94fe311fdf3e15c1fcaf15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ishin Iwasaki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
