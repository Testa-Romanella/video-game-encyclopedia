This is a card game with amazing graphics and ease of use to bring you the best experience.<br/><br/>[ FEATURES ]<br/><br/>+ 1,000,000 puzzles totally!<br/>+ 1 vs 1 mode. You can play a match with your friend on one device.<br/>+ More board styles and poker styles.<br/>+ Detailed statistics of game status.<br/>+ Game center support.<br/>+ Unlimited undo.<br/>+ Unlimited hints.<br/><br/>[ RULES ]<br/><br/>To win the game, all cards must be arranged over the four foundation piles (the slots marked with A at the top of the screen) in four sequences of same suit from A-K.<br/><br/>+ Cards can be moved from tableau to tableau (the eight piles of cards on the screen).<br/>+ Cards can be moved either as top card alone, or as an alternating-color sequence (e.g. Q-J-10).<br/>+ A card can also be moved to an empty cell (the four slots on the top-right side of the screen) or to a foundation pile. A cell may contain only one card.<br/>+ The longest sequence of cards you can move during a single operation is equal to the number of empty cells plus one. However, this number doubles for every empty tableau available (notice though that when moving the cards to an empty tableau, then that tableau is not counted). The reason is that an empty tableau acts like an extra empty cell, yet it can add multiple cards on it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:54:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b91c04cf1a76472d561604a9ef2aebb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zhiwei Lai"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Zhiwei Lai"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
