Easy login and game play.</p>\n<p>Cards may be played as singles or in groups of two, three or five, in combinations which resemble poker hands. The leading card to a trick sets down the number of cards to be played; all the cards of a trick must contain the same number of cards. The highest ranking card is 2 instead of A. Highest to lowest: (\u2660,\u2665,\u2663,\u2666).</p>\n<p>The combinations and their rankings are as follows, mostly based on poker hands:</p>\n<p>Single cards: Any card from the deck, ordered by rank with suit being the tie-breaker. (For instance, A\u2660 beats A\u2665, which beats K\u2665.)</p>\n<p>Pairs: Any two cards of matching rank, ordered as with singular cards by the card of the higher suit. (A pair consisting of the K\u2660 and K\u2663 beats a pair consisting of K\u2665 and K\u2666.)</p>\n<p>Triples: Three equal ranked cards, three twos are highest, then aces, kings, etc. down to three threes, which is the lowest triple.</p>\n<p>Five-card hands: There are five different valid five-card hands, ranking from low to high as follows (the same ranking as in poker):</p>\n<p>Straight: Any 5 cards in a sequence (but not all of the same suit). Rank is determined by the value of the biggest card, with the suit used only as a tie-breaker. Therefore 3-4-5-6-7 &lt; 2-3-4-5-6, since 2 is considered the largest card in the 2-3-4-5-6 straight. The largest straight is A-2-3-4-5, second 2-3-4-5-6, third 10-J-Q-K-A while the smallest straight is 3-4-5-6-7.</p>\n<p>Flush: Any 5 cards of the same suit (but not in a sequence). Rank is determined by Face value of the cards (highest first, then each lower card in order). Suit (\u2660,\u2665,\u2663,\u2666), is used to break ties.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Full house: a composite of a three-of-a-kind combination and a pair. Rank is determined by the value of the triple, regardless of the value of the pair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Four-of-a-kind + One card: Any set of 4 cards of the same rank, plus any 5th card. (A four-of-a-kind cannot be played unless it is played as a five-card hand) Rank is determined by the value of the 4 card set, regardless of the value of the 5th card.</p>\n<p>Straight flush: A composite of the straight and the flush: five cards in sequence in the same suit. Ranked the same as straights, suit being a tie-breaker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the first game on a new table, the player with the 3\u2666\u00a0 starts by either playing it singly or as part of a combination, leading to the first trick. Play proceeds clockwise, with normal climbing-game rules applying: each player must play a higher card or combination than the one before, with the same number of cards. Players may also pass, thus declaring that they do not want to play (or do not hold the necessary cards to make a play possible). A pass does not hinder any further play in the game, each being independent, referred to as jumping-back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T11:15:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/842/8427bb60cd8c6ba037ce7b0f3946047b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AmonRay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
