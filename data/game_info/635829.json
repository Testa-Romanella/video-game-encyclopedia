It's called Ignition.</p>\n<p>In the game, you are a circle that hover around a bigger circle. You are supposed to press space when you hover over the red line. If you do, you gain a scorepoint, and the red line moves clockwise. This keeps looping until you reach score 26, where the game ends. You can replay it as much as you want.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Preview: </p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>It costs one dollar. It took me a little while to make. I programmed it in visual studio using SFML and C++.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made the app with the goal to inspire or 'rev up' people.</p>\n<p>Possible additions I could have added would be a screen shake or 3d effect to make it more intense.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for considering my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T06:58:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b7/9b71d006cedac098d795d27732dc1ea9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vlxedits"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
