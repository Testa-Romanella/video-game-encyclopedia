Although you have nothing but an old glider to slow your descent, you start the journey to the forbidden depths. Will you be able to survive when daylight fades into the cold glow of the forgotten? Do you have what it takes to reach the deepest caverns.<br/></p>\n<p>Delabor is a third person character action game. In the gamejam release you can run, jump and glide your way through The Well. Should this game see continued development, we plan to add combat, survival and much more. We had a lot more in mind in terms of story and progression but this is all we had time for.</p>\n<p>*This project is made using Unity HDRP, which currently does not support Vulkan or OpenGL.
