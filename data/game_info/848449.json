The game is quite short, but very impactful, and based on true events that transpired during Samantha's childhood. This was the very first game she ever made on her own, and she is proud of what she did in such a short amount of time having no prior knowledge in coding or game development. Enjoy the ride, and thank you so much for playing!*</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T22:01:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/306/3065443d4bc6bb922ff6f1466307c01d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Venom0243"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
