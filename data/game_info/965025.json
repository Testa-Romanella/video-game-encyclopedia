Jank \"Cube\" VR has a plethora of unique cubes to play around with<br/><br/>All the while the player is fully physics based, vault over an obstacle, climb up a ledge, jump from 50 feet in the air all with completely simulated player physics!<br/>Alongside the physical player there is physics tools for players to use with their interactables, incase you find moving objects manually a little uninspired.<h3>The Maps</h3>What would a fun physics VR game without some fun VR maps made from the ground up with VR interaction in mind?<br/><br/><br/><strong>Map 1: Interactables Testing Area</strong><br/>The Interactables Testing Area is an all-rounder map from as far back 2020 when I initially created Jank Cube. Sporting numerous rooms with individual and unique interactables and an open area exclusively for spawning extra interactables. There are 3 main floors to Map 1, on floor one you will find tons of cubes, some cones, the delete/clone hammers, a miniature bowling alley, and an airlock for disposing of unwanted items. On floor two you find some more object spawners and a slide for deleting what you dont need, and finally on floor three you have available settings and spawnable ragdoll dummies.<br/><br/><strong>Map 2: The Auditorium</strong><br/>The Auditorium is intended to be a much more confined and smaller map so as to be easier on weaker computers, no objects are spawned in by default and the area is almost completely and open by default. Again an airlock is provided for disposing of unwanted objects, alongside the 2 hammers.<br/><br/><strong>Map 3: Interactables Testing Area 2</strong><br/>Map 3 is the complete opposite of Map 2, instead of being completely open and empty Map 3 has a constant supply of new things to see and do! For example upon entering the main area of Map 3 you will see an ascending staircase, a small bar type area on a grassy patch, tons of object spawners and a grand statue right in the middle. If you find yourself going up the staircase on the first platform there is a fully physics based escalator to put interactables on (yes I did it first) and watch them go! On the next floor is a bar stocked with colorful bottles, tables and chairs. At the top floor you are provided a basketball hoop and some basketballs, try not to lose them all over the edge though, they're quite bouncy. <br/><br/><strong>Map 4: The RV</strong><br/>The RV is a small, warm and cozy RV for you to relax or play around with objects in, the lights are low and everyones just chilling out maxing relaxing all cool. Inside the RV there's some colorful glasses and bottles, a small assortment of interactables, and a nice warm bed waiting just for you.<br/><br/>Including a selection of 12 secret maps you can find hidden throughout the game, although maybe you'd be better off not looking...<br/>Uncover the hidden story of Jank Cube while playing it and gain answers to alot of questions you might have.<br/>Evil forces surround the bubble that is Jank Cube, and it only takes a small poke for it to pop...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T04:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e574f0178720a2a276ad5744bb9f439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sean-John Tame"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ShibaGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
