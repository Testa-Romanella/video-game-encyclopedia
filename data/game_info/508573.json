{"id": 508573, "slug": "king-of-movies", "name": "King of Movies", "name_original": "King of Movies", "description": "A fantastic family game of fearlessly false film fibbery!<br/><br/>To triumph at King of Movies, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve seen every film ever made or if you\u2019ve never seen a movie in your life. The fun is in the fibbing! This quick n\u2019 easy party game can be enjoyed by cinephiles and casual film fans alike, and features classic reviews written by \u201980s icon Leonard Maltin, the ultimate movie authority.<br/><br/>During gameplay, the \u201cMaltin\u201d character will prompt the table by sharing an obscure film title drawn from 750 excerpts from Maltin\u2019s rampaging repertoire of reviews. The rest of the players (Imposters) each craft their own false movie synopsis while attempting to mirror the writing style of the original King of Movies.<br/><br/>Once the players\u2019 submissions are mixed up with the real synopsis, \u201cThe Maltin\u201d reads them to the group out loud while Imposters vote to identify which one they believe is Maltin\u2019s own handiwork.<br/><br/>Points are earned by identifying the real review, or by fooling others into thinking yours was written by Maltin. Whoever earns the most points by the end of the game is declared the KING OF MOVIES, and lives a life of monumental movie majesty!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T02:27:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8d/d8d7548fb32a1324b572e10e01175921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
