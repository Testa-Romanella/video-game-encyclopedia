Your goal is to reach the spaceship, collect stars and avoid enemy aliens! This game combines the functionality of two classic retro games: the platforming of\u00a0Donkey Kong and the ball movement of the original Golf for the NES. The player is controlling the ball hero by pointing a direction with the mouse and adjusting jump strength by holding the left mouse button.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:57:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8e/d8ea23c5d33f5c4141bc3f1c7aff05ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["talzxc"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
