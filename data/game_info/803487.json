What obstacles will they face?</p>\n<p><strong>The full game features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>3 different location story</strong></li><li><strong>Mini Games</strong></li><li><strong>Funfact</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Early Childhood (eC)\u00a0 and\u00a0Everyone (E)</strong></p>\n<p><em>What's a visual novel?</em>\n</p>\n<p>A visual novel is a game with little traditional \"gameplay.\" The player reads text on the screen, accompanied by visuals and audio, and follows through a set story. However, they can make choices to determine the story's route and the ending. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure book, except in a game (and with art and sound!).\r\n</p>\n\n<p>On this page you will find\u00a0 the demo version, which is free.
