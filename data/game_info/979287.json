Play the standalone app Season 1 and its DLC - Season 2, make a save at the end of Season 2, start the standalone Season 3 and load that save;<br/></li><li>2. Launch the standalone Season 3 app. Select \"Play Season 1 &amp; 2\" from the Main Menu, go through the content of these seasons and immediately start playing Season 3 (Note: in this case, the Season 1 &amp; 2 content will be visually marked, as the standalone Season 3 app actually contains all of the Season 1 &amp; 2 content).<br/></li><li>3. If none of the methods above work for you, you can launch the Season 3 standalone app and load one of the 2 save files in the \"Load\" menu. We've added these in case the player doesn't have saves made at the end of Season 2 and doesn't want to go through the game from the beginning.</li></ul><strong>Warning!</strong> The game's save files are located in two places:<br/><ul><li>1. In the game folder (\"game\\saves\").<br/></li><li>2. In the \"C:\\Users\\*username*\\AppData\\Roaming\\RenPy\\MyPleasure-S\" folder common to Seasons 1, 2 and 3. This means that if you start Season 3, you can load the saves you made in Seasons 1 and 2, because the game will detect the files in the \"AppData\\Roaming\\RenPy\\MyPleasure-S\" folder. But if you make saves in Season 3 and try to load them by running the standalone Season 1 app (and its Season 2 DLC), the game will crash because Season 1 can't find the Season 3 content.</li></ul><br/><strong>We've added the Season name to the name of the saves. Do not attempt to load saves from the Season 3 standalone app while playing the Season 1 standalone app.</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T15:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8ea456df243958c92b374991328f2124.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tasty Pics Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tasty Pics Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
