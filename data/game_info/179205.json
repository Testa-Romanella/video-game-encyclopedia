By hunting Penguins and selling their hides. Play as Santa in his off-season and see much money you can make to fund next year's Christmas.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours for the 48 Secret Jam December 2017. I did all of the programming and audio, and the art was done by Nathan Wolfe. We ran into a fair few issues in development so this is not polished at all, and not very close as a game to the result we originally envisioned. None the less, we hope you enjoy.</p><p><strong>Tips</strong></p><p>- Don't aim direction over the penguins, line up your aim with their direction.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Mouse Movement - Aim</p>\n<p>Left Click - Shoot</p><p><strong>Known Bugs</strong></p><p>- The light does not reset when you reset the game.</p><p>- Aiming issue when mousing over colliders.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84f/84fdee7fe53b6c53ecbad388935d0a86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarrixx"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
