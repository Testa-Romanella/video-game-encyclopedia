{"id": 126733, "slug": "folly", "name": "Folly", "name_original": "Folly", "description": "<p><strong>Folly</strong> is an existential endurance game, a futile quest for larger numbers before the inevitable face of death. Taking a distant and disinterested perspective, Folly takes perverse humor from the fervor with which we play the game, questioning the cumulative value of our individual choices, identity and experience. What is the relationship between our qualitative experiences and our socially programmed need for progressive quantification?</p>\n<p>As ultimately irrational creatures, we seem forever driven to acquisition and repetitious consumption, playing a game we cannot possibly win, all of our arbitrary decisions convergent upon the impossible desire to exist outside of time. In the end, we have nothing to show, for we are not. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The WebGL version of the game is embedded in the page.  It may take 5-15 seconds to load when running for the first time. The downloadable versions feature full resolution uncompressed graphics.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Folly is intended to be played with one hand. (Imagine your index and middle fingers are legs.)</em></p>\n<p>Game and original assets are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Additional Information on Folly</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64f926e135a1e007eccc7f7da10378a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Juno AM"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
