I have doubled down even more hours that usual and tried something very different than what I would usually make.<br/><br/>I am hoping that the game has no bugs, there is a save feature so you can come back at any time to run the endless mode! :)<br/><br/>Endless mode has a lot more secrets and features than the tutorial. I hope you have a lot of fun playing this.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Werq by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4616-werq</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T03:37:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cad/cade713e549dc9af63845fa2b829b44c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fmlad"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
