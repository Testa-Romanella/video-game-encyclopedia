You will help \n      Betty make all the money she needs by helping Grampy open \u201cBetty\u2019s\u201d Jazz \n      Club, and work to take the tiny club from rags to riches. With each \n      shift Betty is one step closer to the silver screen as \u201cBetty\u2019s\u201d grows \n      into a spectacular Jazz Club with service so fast and entertainment so \n      great Betty will have no problem raising the cash to fund her big debut! \n      Betty has two shifts at the club! For the first shift, Betty works in a \n      casual environment where guests are free to enter and seat themselves. \n      The customers make their requests to Betty - maybe it's for a milkshake, \n      some candy, or a song from the band. Service them quickly for a bigger \n      tip! In the second shift, Betty hits the stage! As Betty's concert \n      begins, music notes will appear on the top screen - use the Nintendo DS \n      stylus to select the corresponding notes in the correct order on the \n      touch screen. Each correct note earns the cheers of the audience and \n      more tips for Betty. But one wrong note and the crowd may decide to turn!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:56", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Black Lantern Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Destination Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
