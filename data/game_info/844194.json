Since my goal was to learn OpenGL and not make a game, this \"Game\" is highly buggy, unstable, and not fun to play. It also uses up\u00a0 a lot of ram(60%), gpu and cpu on my potato pc(i3-8th gen, 4 gb ram, intel uhd 630 integrated gpu). So if your pc is worse than mine, I recommend you not run this \"game\".</p>\n<p>Souce code if you're interested:\u00a0https://github.com/Hemanth3303/Brackeys-Game-Jam-2022.2-Submission\u00a0(highly suggest to not look at it if you don't want to die from cringe)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T18:20:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c50d6c51832eee5c8408f5e328a2e89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hemanth03"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
