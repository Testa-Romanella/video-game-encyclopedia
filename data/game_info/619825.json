Go near a piece to attach it to yourself, or to other pieces that are already attached. Build the shape you need and put it where it needs to go.</p>\n<p>Sounds simple, but you'll very quickly realize that it's a lot trickier than you first think.</p>\n\r\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow keys:\u00a0move</li><li>Enter: Submit score</li><li>Mute music: CTRL+M</li></ul>\r\n\r\nTOGAM 2021\r\n<ol><li>January:\u00a0Purple Haiku\u00a0// A game about feeling lost, while being relaxed about it</li><li>February:\u00a0Massacre: Tactics\u00a0//\u00a0A game about barbarians facing difficult decisions</li><li>March:\u00a0Astral Souls\u00a0//\u00a0A deckbuilder game where you build the ship by placing souls in synergized way to save the galaxy</li><li>April:\u00a0Don't Drown\u00a0// A game about diving as deep as possible and coming back to tell the story</li><li>May:\u00a0Infight // A puzzle-shooter prototype about setting enemies against one another</li><li>June:\u00a0Sokotetris\u00a0//\u00a0A game about joining tetris pieces together</li></ol>\r\n\r\nLINKS\r\n<p>Discord\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Twitter\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Facebook\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Instagram\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Various assets by Kenney</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack</p>\n<p>Font \"PixelMix\" by Andrew Tyler</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/pixelmix.font</p>\n<p>SFX by wow sound</p>\n<p>https://wowsound.com/</p>\n<p>Music \"a_weird_Come_Together_cover.mp3\" by Damla Kockar</p>\n<p>https://instagram.com/damlatiltak</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:20:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f9/5f93e7035b8ecc763f64d7deb26bc8d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Torreng Labs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
