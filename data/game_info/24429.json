With three and a half hours \n      work a week, there's barely time to fit in all the sleeping, eating and \n      cave-painting that needs to be done. So when greedy dinosaurs guzzle his \n      village's winter food source, Sam is mad! Armed with his best club and \n      his powerful hunter's voice, Sam needs your help to guide him through 22 \n      levels of food-gathering and dinosaur-bashing. With fast-paced action, \n      hundreds of secret areas, weapons and unlikely vehicles to find, you'll \n      need to be smart. Well, smarter than Sam, anyway...\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b03/b033e9abf251f6e1fb1d0851a5d1439b.jpg", "website": "http://www.interplay.com/games/dsiware", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 424, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Interplay Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
