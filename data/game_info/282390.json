Upgrade buildings, name your ships, and process herring! Now in both Acadian French and English!<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Context:</em></strong> made during a Holiday break game jam. This was a challenging jam, since the concept required lots of coding and number crunching, which isn't my strength. Not so much time for balancing and tweaking. It ended up taking 36 instead of 24 hours, but it was a fun game to make. I learned a lot that will be really handy down the line!\u00a0Check out\u00a0https://kyle-honey.itch.io/ and https://beets.itch.io/ for the other jammers!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fish Industry Consultants:</em></strong> Adrien Saulnier, Kyle Honey<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Music: </em></strong>\"Almost New\" \"Folk Round\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61cebb0fd8adee4e02dc1ab096abf2cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Fring Frang"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
