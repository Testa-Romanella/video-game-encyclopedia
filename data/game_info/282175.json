But instead in this game you can dig a single spot and talk to a single NPC. This game was made with the godot engine and i loved working on it, but i can't figure out how to make this game fun, so i'm publishing it as is, and moving on to another project, feel free to leave a suggestion in the comments section. Even if it is not completed i am proud of what i have done. </p>\n<p>Subscribe to my mailing list if you want to know what i am going to do next.</p>\n<p>This game was made using the\u00a0Godot Engine, you will need it if you want to edit the project yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e8bfeca8fbe7ae09cdff55fb9b0930d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cantaloupe Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
