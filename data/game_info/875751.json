{"id": 875751, "slug": "golden-sun-jenna-edition", "name": "Golden Sun Jenna Edition", "name_original": "Golden Sun Jenna Edition", "description": "<p>Golden Sun 1 with Jenna inserted into Garret's place includes Jenna's stats, class and Psynergy from Lost Age. Will (eventually) have two different patches, a \"Modern\" version and a \"Classic\" verison.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features Included In Both Versions...</strong></p>\n<p>- Jenna takes Garet's place in the game and vice versa.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>- This means she will be in your party for the entire game, with her stats and abilities from Lost Age included.</p>\n<p>- To make up for the lack of Garet, Guard and Protect are now water Psynergy that Mia learns in her default class line.</p>\n<p>- Guard is learned at level 3, Protect is learned at level 15, she needs to have at least 4 Mercury Djinn to have access to these.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra Features in Modern Version</strong></p>\n<p>The Modern version has features to improve overworld traveling, and other quality of life features that I first implemented in Dawn of Djinn.\u00a0 Including...</p>\n<p>- Skipping the prologue, as well as Flint's tutorial.</p>\n<p>- Being able to use Retreat as fast travel on the world map (as well as warping to the entrance of towns)</p>\n<p>- Avoid not only being available from the start, but it now behaves as a literal on/off toggle, rather than how it behaves in vanilla.</p>\n<p>- Scared Feathers now takes on an effect similar to the Djinni Quartz (60% chance to revive ally to half health)</p>\n<p>- Quartz's ability now acts as a 80 HP heal that is guaranteed to revive if the ally is down.</p>\n<p>- The adept ring got a buff, now recovering 15 PP to the target</p>\n<p>- All Psynergy that is strictly utility costs 0 PP.</p>\n<p>- A fire Psynergy version to Growth, \"Sunshine\", is available on Jenna, regardless of her class.</p>\n<p>- Ivan gains a new Psynergy, Gust, regardless of his class. It is an utility exclusive Psynergy that functions like Whirlwind.</p>\n<p>- Mia gains a new Psynergy, \"Holy Ply\". Outside of battle it lets you solve the puzzles of the Mercury Lighthouse. In battle, it heals a small amount PP to an ally. Mia will have access to this Psynergy, regardless of class.</p>\n<p>- Ply from the original game is now referred to as \"Healing Ply\".</p>\n<p>- Frost and Douse are battle exclusive Psynergy with \"Chill\" and \"Rain\" acting as their utility equivalent.</p>\n<p>- Douse Drop and Frost Gem now bestow Rain and Chill respectfully when equipped.</p>\n<p>- Chill and Rain also appear in more classes than Frost and Douse normally would</p>\n<p>- The Shaman's Rod also bestows Rain when equipped, instead of being a weapon. So that it's at least doing something as it takes up an inventory slot for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>- You no longer have to worry about Psynergy items taking up your inventory, as they can be sold and rebought as you please.</p>\n<p>- Djinn no longer can runaway from you in battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Noticable Issues and Other Disclaimers...</strong></p>\n<p>- Implementing fast travel in the Modern version does come at the cost of Bilbin Barricade no longer existing in the game normally. This is because the code that I use to implement this feature uses that location's map marker for Crossbone Isles to allow fast travel to that dungeon once you've reached it once.</p>\n<p>- In the Modern version, do not leave Avoid on before saving and quitting the game as there is a bug with the ability that causes the toggle not to work properly if you do.\u00a0 If you do run into the bug, transition between areas (such as the overworld and a town) while toggling the ability until it starts functioning again.</p>\n<p>- Various items and Psynergy have been removed in order to fit Jenna's new moves and the new utility Psynergy. These are either items/Psynergy that only exist in the game's code and never actually used, or Psynergy you would normally not get access to post-Lv. 30. Neither of these should be a major issue since getting past level 30 in the first game is normally not possible without excessive grinding.</p>\n<p>- In addition, the Fire Psynergy line has been replaced with the Beam Psynergy line.</p>\n<p>- Certain enemies have their movepools slightly altered to make up for the lack of certain Psynergy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T14:53:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf0/cf0c984ccf4063f552632a10c2494886.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JackitK"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
