Card games turned out hard to make especially the AI part and I completely enjoyed that.\u00a0 I kept going through the idea just because I wanted to get better at creating UI elements. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed coding it, and as always please give as much feedback as possible so I can improve more and more.</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to John Haddad for always creating the best soundtracks :).</p>\n<p>I had to research about the differences between Pasta and Noodles before creating this game so don't even at me! I tried my best!</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>-You get 2 moves on the first round, then each other round you get 1</p>\n<p>-Once you start your round, You can either place a card on the battlefield from your draft or you can attack the player with a card on the battlefield</p>\n<p>-Keep in mind your flour rate, if it drops below 14 which is the minimum flour needed to make a noodle type you will lose.</p>\n<p>-Meatballs are power ups that you can use to add 1 damage to one of the noodles on the battlefield that you own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc9/cc95578c957dd5f77372fdc86f8e8efd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David (Mohammed) Al-Balbaisi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
