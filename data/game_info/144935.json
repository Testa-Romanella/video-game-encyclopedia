They are a vehicle for propagating our thoughts. Why do we use words that convey ambiguity, at best? Why do we assume that the other person understands the context behind the words we choose? We can't read their minds any better than they can read ours. Does that mean you lost and I won, or that everyone lost? Can anyone really lose when winning is impossible, or do we need to rethink our approach so everyone can win?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b5/1b522250dc1bdb0ba426c636d1482ac1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NinjaPatBeck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
