It is a survival sandbox with game mechanics similar to that of Fallout Shelter while it's primary theme is life of German soldiers like in Wolfgang Petersen's film Das Boot. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time.<br/><br/>In UBOOT you control the crew to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there\u2019s no chance of winning even a skirmish. It is important to balance the overall discipline and trauma of your crew. If you are a harsh captain, the level of both goes up. When trauma is high a secret feature of each sailor can be disclosed. It can reveal his alcoholism, make him go berserk, he can also turn out to be a coward or a spy. <br/><br/>Kriegsmarine Headquarters will give you key missions to move forward with the historical stages of WWII and you will be able to fight in new regions, and install better equipment in a dock. Unfortunately, the opponents will also grow stronger and, for example, will equip their ships with radars or break the Enigma code. <br/><br/>In UBOOT each sailor will have his own face, his story, personality, skills and weaknesses. The sailors will come either to report something to you or just to talk some problems over. They will eat, talk, enjoy simple pastimes, queue to the only toilet on board, fight to decide whose girlfriend is prettier. You will see the lives of grey wolves in all its glory.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T03:29:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17f/17f0003af12faf01bb3c360ceac5ef93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.25, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 151, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 552, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deep Water Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
