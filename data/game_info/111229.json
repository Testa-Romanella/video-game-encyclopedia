Or pick them up! Or headbutt them!</p><p>The triggers on either Vive controller will spawn the Pink or Blue Plasmids, respectively. Each Plasmid will only stick to the same color Plasmid.</p><p>Casually move your thumb over the Trackpad to the Left, and you'll spawn Plasmids that are more fluid. These will eventually fall to your feet and roll around.</p><p>Move your thumb on the Trackpad to the Right and the Plasmids will spawn stuck in the air, and fall very slowly. You can try writing things with the Plasmids this way, or building weird structures! But remember, the Plasmids are still 'alive' and may move where you don't intend them!</p><p>If you need to for any reason, press R to reload the scene, and ESC to exit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82e/82e38d792cf1df312042100f844e0d8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["uvwar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
