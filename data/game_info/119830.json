You have a limited number of lives, however, there are hundreds of enemies coming. Each individual enemy is weak, but they can deal a large amount of damage if you aren't careful.</p><p>The game was originally designed and built for the Android platform, however, it has been revamped for the PC platform. During the testing phase many of the players preferred to play it on their PC using a controller, and eventually I decided to scrap the mobile release due to engine limitations at the time. There are several minor annoyances that come from the original mobile design, which will be fixed in updates planned after release.  <br/></p><p>Starwave makes an excellent time sink when you're waiting for something to finish, or just have nothing to do. Most games of Starwave Defender are short, however, you can pause it or stop playing at any time. It has very low resource usage, allowing you to play it when even other resource intensive tasks are running.</p>Game ControlsKeyboardMove Up: W\r\nMove Down: S\r\nMove Left: A\r\nMove Right: D\r\n\r\nShoot Up: Up Arrow\r\nShoot Down: Down Arrow\r\nShoot Left: Left Arrow\r\nShoot Right: Right Arrow\r\nKeyboard + MouseMove Up: W\r\nMove Down: S\r\nMove Left: A\r\nMove Right: D\r\n\r\nShooting: Left Click to shoot at mouseControllerMovement: Left Stick\r\nShooting: Right Stick\r\nSystem RequirementsWindows<p>\r\n\tOS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10</p><p>Processor: 3GHz Dual Core</p><p>Memory: 2GB RAM</p><p>Graphics: DirectX 11 GPU with 1GB VRAM</p><p>Storage: 500MB available space <br/></p>Linux<p> OS: 64-bit, only Ubuntu 14.04 tested</p><p>Processor: 3GHz Dual Core</p><p>Memory: 2GB RAM</p><p>Graphics: GPU with OpenGL 4.3 and 1GB VRAM</p><p>Storage: 500MB available space <br/></p><p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR LINUX USERS</strong>: This game requires OpenGL 4.3, meaning if you are running an AMD GPU you must be running the proprietary drivers!
