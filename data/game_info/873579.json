Considering the party size of 4, a lot of different compositions will surge with that.<br/><strong>- Better UI for area selection: </strong>As there is only one area currently in the game, The \"UI\" to select it is very <em>very </em>barebones, It's something that will obviously change in the future, but I guess why not include it here too, right?<br/><br/>For the game's name: There is lore significance to it, even though you can't really get anything from just this demo.<br/><br/>Consider joining my discord to leave feedback on a place I'll definitely read: discord.gg/9T4BARqmwv<br/>Current version 1.0.3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T08:39:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4da7d37ed3e00d26a9ed710db0f1634a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["neze"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
