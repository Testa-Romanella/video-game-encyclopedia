It was mostly a learning experience for me, but I wanted to put my own spin on it. The goal here is to get rid \u00a0blocks to play the song in each level. When all the blocks are gone, you'll hear the whole riff completed. There are 3 levels to beat, each with its own song and number of blocks to destroy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little game, and check out my other games if you like this one(or even if you don't!)</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move: <strong><em>Mouse, Left/Right Keys, L/R Triggers, Left/Right D-Pad</em></strong></p>\n<p>Exit: <strong><em>Escape</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/967/967cb3ec938f4778912968ae7d2b0852.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alex Owens"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
