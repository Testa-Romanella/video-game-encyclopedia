C.\u300d series, and proudly presented by SakuraGame.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt was at the end of the Great War of Sealing Monsters, or in their language, \"Sigil Baerum\". It was THE event of the year, the princess had just come of age to rule. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith the full moon in the sky, everyone wanted to see the queen's glory. But it was soon blocked by the \"Black Dragon of Destruction\", the world was covered by the \"Tussilago\" which resembled desperation. The festive crowd scattered, and carriages were squashed like eggs. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nStanding there, all alone, is a blond girl facing the monsters which easily vanquished the King's army. You, a young swordsman, used up all your strength and just barely saved her, only found yourself about to fall into the dark fangs. The girl burst into a radiant ray of holy light. And in that light, you heard a soft voice telling you that there was a Holy Saber in your hand. The Saber will guide your way. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut all was lost, and you were wrongfully accused as the murderer of the Queen. You had no choice but to leave for a long journey from home.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc7/fc7689d16500bd06c5e1d5ce8f874687.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 27, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 527, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YAMAYURI GAMES", "Circus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SakuraGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
