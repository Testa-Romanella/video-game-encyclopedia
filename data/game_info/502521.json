{"id": 502521, "slug": "a-fractured-connection", "name": "A Fractured Connection", "name_original": "A Fractured Connection", "description": "<p>A Fractured Connection is a Scum and Villainy based supplemental material, though it could quite easily be matched to other story-based sci-fi ttrpgs. It establishes the basic confines of the world, a way in as well as a loosely structured job/mission. Based upon the setting of the Mass Effect series, it follows some time after the conclusion of the main series.</p>\n<p>In this material as part of an opposing governmental body known as The Collective, the crew in question is asked to come to Rannoch, the Quarian and Geth homeworld to solve a disturbance involving The Alliance, Geth Disappearance and Quarian interference. This supplement could likely be played all in one session anywhere from 2-5 hours, with 2-5 players.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This can be a good introductory session or something to put within the scheme of a bigger campaign. Either way i think it can be an interesting way to help modify or create a basis of a world based in a familiar setting. Since it's contextually related to existing ip, i'l leave this as a free download, though donations are appreciated, hope you enjoy it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:23:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/038/038533fb72ad758b75a276976c73f49e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kai F"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
