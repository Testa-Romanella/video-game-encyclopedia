I\u00a0challenge myself to make a game in 3 short hours. But by the end of those 3 hours, while I had something\u00a0that was functional and could be called a game, it wasn't very good. Or even fun. So I decided it would be best to just give myself a couple days to refine and polish the game.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, the game was complete after the first 4 or 5\u00a0hours. So I spent the rest of the time just tweaking the difficulty and\u00a0iterating on any part of the game that I felt could be improved. I had enough time that I got to really focus on a lot of the things I typically neglect in game jam games, like the art and sound. And I spent hours tweaking the difficulty to try and find a good balance. After about 48 hours (almost exactly) of working on the game I reached the point where it felt as complete and polished as I could get it. I'm not used to having so much time left over in a game jam, and I think it was mostly due to the small scope of the game (I tend to be overly ambitious in game jams) and the ease of using Godot.</p>\n<p>This was my first game jam using Godot, and man does it make a difference.\u00a0I used to use GameMaker Studio 2 for game jams because of how quick and easy the engine makes building prototypes. Somehow Godot feels even faster, and the work flow is so fun that I spend most of the time completely in the zone, and never feel like the engine is working against me. After using Godot for only a month,\u00a0I can safely say it is the best game engine (for 2D) I have ever used.</p>\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n<p><strong>Art</strong><br/>All art was made by me using Aseprite during the jam. No pre-made art assets were used.</p>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong><br/>Also me. All code in the game was written during the jam.</p>\n<p><strong>Sound</strong><br/>All sound effects are from sound packs I had previously purchased.</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/>\"The Lift\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T20:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a05535b727e8d7a9e3d44471d1c4f1fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Justin C"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
