Left without a means to get back home to Mars, you must blend in with the society of this foreign race called \"humans\", using your wits to scour the cities and suburban landscape for the scattered parts of your rocketship, repair it and get back home.</p>\n<p>But beware! Though your shapeshifting powers let you pass well enough for humans, your ship's arrival did not go unnoticed. Secret agents from Area 51 are investigating the entire region, hoping to catch you! Balance your hard work repairing the ship with lying low and dodging suspicion from the authorities. Work together as a team, or look out for number one in this board game you can print and play anywhere!</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>4 players recommended</li><li>4 pages (game board; rulebook; event cards and tile cards cutouts)</li><li>Requires 6-sided dice; pen and paper</li><li>Can be printed out from .docx or .jpeg (both options included)</li><li>Tokens (such as coins) recommended</li><li>Average playtime: \u00a030-45 minutes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ec/7ec3e05f3aa2e871b4252c55215bc40f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Setokaiva"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
