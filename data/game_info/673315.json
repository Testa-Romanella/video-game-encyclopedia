The test involves three players, where Player A has to determine which of Player B and Player C is the human. The other player would be a chatbot.</p>\n<p>This game simplifies the test's rules to require only two players: you (the judge) and either a chatbot or another human. All answers to questions have been taken from real chatbots and humans. Because there's no real chatbot functionality in this game, you have to choose from pre-written prompts.</p>\n\n<p>Chatbots used:</p>\n<p>A.L.I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Mitsuku</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to my friends for volunteering their answers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T07:21:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/822/8225f99795cbc0ad817e73948696db1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rabbytt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
