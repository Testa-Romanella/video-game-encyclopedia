Singleplayer - Practice up, earn money, and gain exp against AI opponents.<br/>\r\n2. Local Multiplayer - Up to 4 people can play on one computer together. 2 can play on the keyboard. 2 more can play on gamepads. Or you can have 4 on gamepads. Or you can have 3 on gamepads and 1 on the keyboard... you get the idea.<br/>\r\n3. Online Multiplayer - Up to 8 people can play with each other on LAN or across the internet with the help of VPN's like Hamachi or Evolve.<br/>\r\n4. COMING SOON! Online Matchmaking - Get paired up with random people online to test your skill against the world's.
