This was created for the extra credits jam #3 with the theme \"cycles\".\u00a0 Also,\u00a0I was informed that the hamster won't display properly on some resolutions after I had already posted the game. It should display properly on any 16:9 resolution. Sorry for the inconvenience, testing for different resolutions completely slipped my mind during the jam.</p>\n<p>Protect the city from giant lizards by taking control of a mecha, which just so happens to be powered by a hamster wheel. Any action from the mecha costs energy, so you will have to manage how much energy you spend compared to how much you generate.</p>\n<p>This was a solo project and I was responsible for the art and programming though I\u00a0did not create any of the audio.</p>\n\n<p>This game uses these sounds from freesound:</p>\n<p>concrete_step_1.wav by Movingplaif (https://freesound.org/people/movingplaid/sounds/76187/)</p>\n<p>LAZER SOUND.wav by\u00a0Neirbonad1 (https://freesound.org/people/neirbonad1/sounds/178055/)</p>\n<p>Big Swipe.wav by\u00a0LukeSharples (https://freesound.org/people/LukeSharples/sounds/209075/)</p>\n<p>Squeak 01.wav by LG (https://freesound.org/people/LG/sounds/72655/)</p>\n\n<p>Music by Eric Matyas</p>\n<p>\"Kingdom of Buffoons\"</p>\n<p>www.soundimage.org<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7e/e7ea8fe78389d94571ba11219ba7f5c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamie Spruin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
