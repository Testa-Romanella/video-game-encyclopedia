THIS HAS BEEN FIXED!!</p>\n<p>Sometimes the screen has extreme color issues, I haven't been able to recreate this consistently, though I am guessing it either has to do with the monitors refresh rate, or some messed up math in the shader code.</p>\n<p>There's no options menu yet, but again this is a WIP</p>\n<p>It will work in other browsers, but won't be formatted properly</p>\n\n<p>Heres the GitHub repo, feel free to take and use the code however you'd like:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/sublimeaffix/Sublime-Slime-Time\u00a0(OLDER BUILD)</p>\n<p>If the HTML version isn't working, or if you simply just prefer it, I have included a downloadable version in the form of a .zip\u00a0of the game below.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun, and please share any thoughts / issues you have in the comments :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T08:54:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/349ab1515cd309fea17cc3b4813faf22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["COWBOMOWBO"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
