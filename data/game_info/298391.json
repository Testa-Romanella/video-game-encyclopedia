The more time you spend on your Kingdom's territory, the more loyal it becomes. Your Kingdom's Loyalty provides a stronger hold for your Kingdom when defending what's yours. Don't explore too far without having close distance between your loyal Kingdom to back you up!</p>\n<p>You collect resources as you expand by building Saw Mills and Stone Quarries. These resources can be used to build Barracks and other buildings. Barracks provide Units for your Kingdom; having these will allow you to conquer enemy buildings to further expand.</p>\n<p>You may also attempt to separate an enemy from their Kingdom and watch their Kingdom fall! Be careful, enemies will attempt to do the same to you! If you can get in close and infiltrate their Kingdom, you may attack them directly at their core to bring them down for a swift victory!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T06:15:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/839/839d67f4bced18b2891ff38e5631144e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["braydeejohnson"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
