The only problem however, is that your\u00a0body is weak and vulnerable. Dodge and parry to earn your chance to defeat each boss!</p>\n<p>This project is a prototype made by a\u00a0group of 2nd year students studying\u00a0<strong>Bachelor of Software Engineering\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>Bachelor of Creative Technologies\u00a0</strong>under\u00a0<strong>Media Design School, New Zealand</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is our fourth prototype done as a group.
