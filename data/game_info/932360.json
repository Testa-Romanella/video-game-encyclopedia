The goal is to arrange and learn the atomic structures based on <strong>The Atlas of Atomic Nuclear Structures</strong> in 3's and then they connect. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Atlas of Atomic Nuclear Structures (ANS)</strong> is one of the major output results of the <strong>Basic Structures of Matter\u00a0 Supergravitation Unified Theory (BSM-SG)</strong>, based on an alternative concept of the physical vacuum. The atlas of ANS illustrates the material structure of the elementary particles and atomic nuclei as they are revealed in BSM-SG. While they exhibit the same interaction energies as the Quantum Mechanical models, they are not point-like structures. The atlas also provides information about the spatial arrangement of the protons and neutrons in the atomic nuclei, atoms and molecules. The Z-number trend of the nuclear build-up follows a shell structure that complies strictly with the row-column pattern of the Periodic table, while obeying the Hundys rules and Pauli exclusion principle. The nuclear structures of the stable isotopes exhibit a higher degree of symmetry. The trend of faster increase of the number of neutrons in comparison to the protons in heavier elements and their spatial positions play a role in redistribution of the repulsive Coulomb forces between protons. The proposed physical models could find applications in different fields, such as the chemistry, nanotechnology, biomolecules and deeper understanding of the nuclear stability and reactions.</p>\n<p>The Atlas of Atomic Nuclear Structures (ANS)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T16:42:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a51/a51f6bda705940828a493d107d38e952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oldmountainstudio"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
