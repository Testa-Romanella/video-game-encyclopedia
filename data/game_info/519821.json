Thanks to the school, I am so happy to get a chance to make my own visual novel as my dream. I am working with me. Yes. Only me.<br/></p><p>This is a\u00a0<strong>dating-sim visual novel</strong>\u00a0based on\u00a0<strong>COVID-19 pandemic situation</strong>. Most of dialogues are on the messenger, even you don't know who are you talking to. My question is -\u00a0<strong>Can you date someone even you have never met in real life?<br/></strong><br/><br/><br/>You are a\u00a0<strong>junior high school student in school closure</strong>. You invited to a\u00a0<strong>Netcord (parody of Discord)</strong>\u00a0from the link that your teacher given. There is a bunch of new friends are waiting, but some of them are pretty interested in you, and finally you decided to date one of them even you haven't met them yet.\u00a0<strong>How can you describe what is love made of?</strong>\u00a0Appearance? Emotion? Or just nature mechanism like an animal?<br/><br/>The\u00a0<strong>game is currently in the alpha stage</strong>\u00a0and free demo available on itch.io. Currently, my game\u00a0<strong>only supports Korean</strong>\u00a0and needs to add English/Japanese translation, CGs, tons of contents on my own. I can ask to make a team with a professional artist who already involved in, but she is mostly doing overwork in her main job. If you support me, I can treat her as a team member and I can hire a composer who can write a song for this game.<br/><br/><strong>TastyLove</strong>\u00a0is currently\u00a0<strong>powered by Renpy</strong>\u00a0for studying, but can be changed to\u00a0<strong>Unity</strong>\u00a0later.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T07:12:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6be/6be71c05d016a8e9c08b273df1e04d43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["TeacherShiba"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
