This game is a small example of three small projects all utilizing Genetic Algorithms. Please play each scene and have fun with the interactive projects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to use the first example:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Click on the shapes with the color that you desire\u00a0<strong>Last</strong></li><li>Each generation the Algorithm will create a new population and these will be closer to the size and color that you want.</li></ul>\n<p>How to use the second and third examples:</p>\n<ul><li>Once these scenes are loaded you can use the slider in the top left corner to modify the population size (50 by default)</li><li>then you can click the set population button to set the population amount you desire</li><li>Next there are buttons that will take you back to the main menu and the next project.</li><li>You can also reset the project and switch how it creates each population.\u00a0</li><li>The first is sorting by time alive.\u00a0</li><li>the next is by distance. this will make the AI more apt to run forward down the path.</li></ul>\n<p>Thank you for reading and taking the time to play this example!
