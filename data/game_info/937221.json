Holding left or right against a wall allows you to cling onto them, while holding up while on a wall or ceiling allows you to perform a short wall or ceiling run. X shifts realities. Down interacts with benches.</p>\n<p>This game was made over the course of eight days as my first game. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it, and if the message resonates with you, I hope you find peace. The movement system was partly inspired by Dustforce, so check that game out if you need your ceiling running fix.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T11:33:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/996/996ee5d3b8849eeaf237c230934513fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["surd"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
