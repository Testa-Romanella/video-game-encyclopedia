The game starts off right after our heroes escape captivity after being sold into the black market. As such, they must reunite with each other to venture out into the forest to rescue both the other critters caught by the poacher, and their precious egg. On your adventure, make sure to constantly switch control between both critters, since only by working together, can they solve each other\u2019s puzzles and challenges. Keep in mind that the orange and bulkier critter can pick up smaller enemies and boxes, while the blue and slim critter can jump higher and slide, which can stun smaller enemies and go through thigh spaces. We have talked about smaller enemies, but keep in mind that larger enemies cannot be picked up, and can only be stunned by being thrown smaller enemies at. The game uses hand drawn sprites and 3D backgrounds, layered with a filter that makes it look like a PlayStation game. The mixture of 3D and 2D, controlling two characters with different move sets, the transition from a man made environment into a natural one, are all made in the hopes of demonstrating aspects of \u201cDuality\u201d that being the theme of this year\u2019s Global Game Jam 2022. Both in a graphical, narrative and in a gameplay sense. As so, we hope you enjoy our little project, and that it may bring you a smile as it did to us.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T04:34:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/750/7504f9529e0e47710798259afcccdd05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hyperimus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
