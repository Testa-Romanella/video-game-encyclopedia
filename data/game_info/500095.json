This remake will aim to better my understanding of Unity as well as creating a game development workflow that works for me. I hope you enjoy my simple game as I only intend to spend a week in development before moving on to my next project. Some assets have been borrowed for a tutorial or two, but I\u00a0intend to replace all graphics as art becomes available (in case you're interested).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:32:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d07636f804b0ed0532cb739c1ecfdab1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["UnfortunateUroboros"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
