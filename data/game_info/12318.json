{"id": 12318, "slug": "multiwinia", "name": "Multiwinia", "name_original": "Multiwinia", "description": "<p>Multiwinia is a sequel to Darwinia. The game is set in a virtual world formerly known as Darwinia that was created as a science experiment. Its virtual tribes eventually went to war on each other to control the world that was now renamed Multiwinia. The Multiwinians are two-dimensional creatures, hence the subtitle Survival of the Flattest. The world around them, however, is surprisingly three-dimensional, albeit with very minimalistic, intentionally low-polygonal graphics that are meant to represent a virtual simulation. Hence, Multiwinia is all about gameplay, not the plot or visuals.<br />\nYou control a tribe of Multiwinians, who look as small, static, vaguely human-like silhouettes. Each tribe is distinct from another in color only. There are six modes, each with its own conditions of victory; those are Assault, Blitzkrieg, Capture the Statue, Domination, King of the Hill, and Rocket Riot. Some of this modes require Multiwinians to capture certain points on the map or to destroy a specific enemy unit, such as a weapon of mass destruction. Each mode allows both a single-player game against the CPU and a multiplayer for up to four players. The controls in Multiwinia are innovative and somewhat unusual yet intuitive. A  WASD-controlled camera is meant to allow a variety of views on the map.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2008-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-22T09:31:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6ca63f03cfd918d0cb51fa2735cab52.jpg", "website": "http://www.introversion.co.uk/multiwinia/", "rating": 2.15, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 96, "owned": 1766, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 34}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 78, "suggestions_count": 757, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 78, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Introversion Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Introversion Software"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
