This was\u00a0 meant to be a 3 act game with the other 2 acts showcasing the point of views of the son and husband. However, the reason it was not continued was due to an EXTREMELY short due date (this was made a day before it's supposed to be passed) for my english class and I'm quite busy!\r\n\u00a0However, \u00a0I hope to finish the other two acts soon with better graphics that is not taken from google &lt;/3\r\n<p>template 'calico' from: https://elliotherriman.itch.io/calico<br/></p>\n<p>Please check the devlogs for further information on the game and some possible errors! Otherwise, credits at the end of the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T18:10:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e50/e50913d90201294029c5c028700a0099.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jimmy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
