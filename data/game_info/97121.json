Yet in 2015, statistics show that <em>21% of people use 10-year-old passwords, 47% use 5-year- old passwords, and 73% of online accounts use passwords that are used in multiple sites</em>*. With this short game, I hope to raise awareness of a very prevalent security flaw that many people still have today.</p><p>In HERO, you are the brave hero called \"HERO\" who must save the village from the \"Bad Codes\", the embodiment of poor password ethics. Can you save the village and defeat the \"Bad Codes\"? This game has an overall theme of password security, with the goal to teach anyone at least something about using and making secure passwords. </p><p>This game was created with <em>RPG Maker MV </em>for educational purposes, and used some assets collected from the Creative Commons search that are credited in the Credits section.
