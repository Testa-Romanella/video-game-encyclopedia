Inspired by older generation games such as Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy X and Jak II: Renegade - While cinematics are\u00a0inspired by current-gen games such as Plague Tale.</p>\n<p><strong>It is also my very first game!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It was entirely developed\u00a0by one developer within <strong>6 weeks</strong> using only <strong>Free Assets.</strong></p>\n<p>I did this as a portfolio piece as I've recently broken into the Game Development world - Previously as a QA Tester / Narrative Editor for Big Ben's <em><strong>Paranoia: Happiness is Mandatory</strong></em>. Before this, I was a Filmmaker / Editor - which I got my degree in.</p>\n<p>Sadly it's very tough in Ireland to get a Game Development job - especially without a degree in gaming. So I taught myself Unity and created this game within 6 weeks to help prove myself as a game developer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is short and free and I hope you guys will take the time to play through it, and let me know what you guys think! I am open to hearing ALL criticism! :)</p>\n<p>Any donations aren't necessary, but\u00a0will be deeply appreciated! Enjoy!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T05:38:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e01f3620f510caadedc1d905b54fb06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["No Purpose Indie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
