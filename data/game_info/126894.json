I thought it was all being backed up in two places, but it was being backed up in neither. The affects of the data loss seems to grow every day. Every time I look for some script I had in my library, it seems like it's gone.</p>\n<p>I've decided to make some very short arty experiences that are fun to make. First, I'm doing it to motivate myself to start working again after a couple weeks of feeling pretty shitty about my mistake. Second, I'd like to get more experience developing atmospheric games about the cyberpunk dystonia we seem to find ourselves in.</p>\n<p>This is very short, it shouldn't take more than a minute to see everything. In the future, I think I'll be aiming for 3-6 minute games with a few interactions. and a bit more mechanical complexity than this.</p>\n<p>For updates on my latest projects, follow me on Twitter.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06a/06aacf13ebbc47e5032d5c689bd8aa71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CJKinni"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
