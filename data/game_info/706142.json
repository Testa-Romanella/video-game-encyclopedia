{"id": 706142, "slug": "pooped", "name": "Pooped", "name_original": "Pooped", "description": "<p>As brand new parents of twins, we tell all of our friends that parenting feels like the game \"Overcooked.\" There's so much to do and so little time, and no matter what you do to prep, clean, manage, and care for babies, there is always more to do. It's a ceaseless to do list of tasks without a \"pause\" button. There were times when things felt impossible, we were physically drained, emotionally exhausted, and the only way we were able to get it all done was to ask for support.</p>\n<p>We built this game to give the player the experience of what it feels like to struggle as a parent facing the difficult task of acknowledging that additional support is needed, and then feel what it's like to receive that support when it is most needed.\r\n</p>\n<p>Built by Goma Games for Care Jam 2021\r\nJon, Kelli, Shante, Jackie, Julian\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.gomagames.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>Making this game took a village of people in order for it to be possible! In addition to our Game Dev team members, we want to thank:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Camryn, our nanny, who is staying a few more hours this week to watch the babies, so that Jon and Kelli could work on this game!\r\n</li><li>The friends and family who have helped care for our babies for either minutes, hours, or days over the past 6 months.\r\n</li><li>NDWA, the organization that Kelli works for, and how we heard about the Care Jam in the first place! NDWA has been extremely supportive of Kelli after returning as a new parent. :)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Being able to work on this was a\u00a0<em>HUGE</em>\u00a0accomplishment for Jon &amp; I. For the past 6 months, it seemed impossible to be able to carve out any creative time at all in our lives. But we did it! And it's possible, thanks to all the support we have!\r\n</p>\n<p>Eventbrite #:\u00a02353429569 (Jon),\u00a02353138389 (Kelli),\u00a02379228029 (Jackie), 2354238989 (Julian), 2353445069 (Shante)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T14:38:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f6/7f6d82636da6a8d69899a1fc913f62f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["gomagames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
