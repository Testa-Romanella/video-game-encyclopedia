{"id": 664045, "slug": "the-stroop-test-tahwi", "name": "The stroop test (Tahwi)", "name_original": "The stroop test (Tahwi)", "description": "<p>The famous \"Stroop Effect\" is named after J. Ridley Stroop who discovered this strange phenomenon in the 1930s. Here is your job: name the colors of the following words. Do NOT read the words...rather, say the color of the words. For example, if the word \"BLUE\" is printed in a red color, you should say \"RED\". Say the colors as fast as you can. It is not as easy as you might think!</p>\n<p>The words themselves have a strong influence over your ability to say the color. The interference between the different information (what the words say and the color of the words) your brain receives causes a problem. There are two theories that may explain the Stroop effect:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Speed of Processing Theory: the interference occurs because words are read faster than colors are named.\r\n</li><li>Selective Attention Theory: the interference occurs because naming colors requires more attention than reading words.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>I think that this puzzle would be easier for a very young child than for older children or adults. Try this out on some small kids who know their colors, but cannot yet read! I would imagine that the children would not get confused by this puzzle because the words would not have any meaning to them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T03:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67d9d3f044deacc925ffb8278701f2b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Tahwi"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
