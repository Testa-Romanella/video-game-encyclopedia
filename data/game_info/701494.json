Discover what the two most secretive members of your fraternity have been up to in their spare time, and learn what makes their new, nocturnal friends members of the mob. Definitely. For sure.\r\n</p>\n<p>They\u2019re totally not vampires. They can\u2019t be. That\u2019d be ridiculous. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Original soundtrack composed by Lyrinae.</li><li>Seven unreliable potential culprits, one missing person, and an unexpectedly chatty ghost.</li><li>Eleven unique endings</li><li>40,000 words of dialogue.\r\n</li><li>Interactive environment</li><li>The world\u2019s most oblivious herd.</li><li>One <em>grave </em>mystery to solve.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Your goal, as your frat boy of choice, is simple: your friend Yancy  is missing, and you need to find him before it\u2019s too late (if he\u2019s even  still alive).  </p>\n<p>There are seven suspects: Kyle, Brett, Keira, Brick, Jules, Luca, and Zane. \r\n </p>\n<p>In order to attain an ending for a particular character, you need to  speak with them during all three time periods they are present and  interactable in the hotel after the introduction (you must speak to  everyone in the introduction), with the exception of one secret ending  available towards the beginning of the game. You will want to focus on a  specific character each run, as failing to talk to any character at  least three times will result in a generic ending of failing to solve  the mystery. <br/></p>\n<p>Many of the endings will not go well for your chosen frat boy. Can you figure out how to save him <em>and </em>solve the mystery of Yancy's disappearance?</p>\n<p>If you're having trouble finding someone or getting a certain ending, check the endings guide thread linked at the bottom of this page!<br/></p>\n<p><em>If you'd like to kick in a tip to support us, here's our Ko-Fi!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T06:55:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/121b14ae3004b4769444c4baf6187ec5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hotel Staff Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
