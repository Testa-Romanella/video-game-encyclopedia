{"id": 978635, "slug": "great-gun-gauntlet", "name": "Great Gun Gauntlet", "name_original": "Great Gun Gauntlet", "description": "In a strange testing facility the player plays as an experimental defense robot being run through a series of challenging gauntlets where obstacles and turrets are brought into the testing arena using a series of conveyors.  Try to survive all the way to the end of each of the gauntlets, or play infinite mode and see how long you can go before the intense challenge finally beats you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe challenges the player can expect to face involve the many different kinds of obstacles the conveyors bring into the arena; some are simple such as basic boxes and barriers, others are more dangerous such as plasma coated objects, some are scary such as the imposing laser beams, but the most notable selection are different kinds of turret guns that take aim at the player and fire several different kinds of glowing bullets that one must dodge or deflect back at them using the robot's deflector shield.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe gauntlets themselves as they progress decide much of the gameplay.  The different phases can change the conveyor speeds and directions, the number of obstacles being brought into the arena, which obstacles are being brought in, and even where they are being brought in or for higher difficulty gauntlets how many bullets are being shot by turrets.  The amount of variety the gauntlets provide means not only can the same one feel different on repeat playthroughs, but different gauntlets are designed in different ways changing up the vibe of the gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor players looking to challenge their high scores or best times the gameplay should have a surprising amount of depth to discover past its simple surface; points are awarded not only for grabbing collectables, but also for destroying obstacles with deflected bullets!  With that alone a lot of strategy can be created as you try to figure out the best method for getting the most effective combo while playing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-18T07:19:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8faa34c03ab0f89040a99697c43fe8d3.jpg", "website": "https://www.goldencrabstudios.com/ggg", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoldenCrab Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GoldenCrab Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
