Using a combination of technology and supernatural powers, you must find and\u00a0cleanse the disease from the mind of its hosts.</p>\n\n\n<p>In <em>Pestilence</em>, the player must navigate through an abandoned subway system where a deadly disease has taken refuge to find human victims playing host to the disease. Upon locating the victims, the player will enter the victim\u2019s mind and remove the disease from the inside out. Utilizing the primary mechanic across four levels of gameplay, the player will encounter physical manifestations of the infection including rats, spiders, and wall eyes that will attempt to infect and kill the player. In the physical world, the player must traverse the level and avoid enemies to reach the victim. In the mindscape, the player must traverse the same, now distorted, level to defeat the enemies and remove the disease from the victim. If the player becomes infected, the level will restart at the last checkpoint.</p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Develop skills towards mastering the blink mechanic and its uses</li><li>Enjoy a balance of challenge and fun upon completing levels</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>The story follows Allos in his quest to restore his status as a god of disease. Having carelessly neglected control over one of his diseases, allowing it to escape to Earth prematurely, Allos\u2019 pantheon stripped him of his godhood, permitting only one road to redemption: reclamation. Allos is determined to restore his godhood, but the only way to do so is to journey to Earth and cleanse the disease from humanity, recapturing it in the process. Upon exiting his godly domain, only his ability to enter the mind of humans and to teleport, albeit a short distance, remain. The escaped disease affects and feeds on human minds, siphoning off their energy and sanity until they are a dying husk of their previous selves. The disease manifests itself as nightmarish mutations of creatures and entities it has observed during its time on Earth. These horrors act as defense mechanisms for the disease, protecting its numerous hosts from those who would seek to destroy it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After arriving on Earth, Allos encountered unexpected resistance from the disease, finding that his mortal body could not simply brush off the disease\u2019s attacks the way his godlier flesh could. The only way he could possibly evade the disease\u2019s defenses was to use the last of his godly abilities for short-range teleportation and tactical battlefield navigation. This limited power would prove useful in evading the few clusters of putrid, otherworldly rat packs and spiders that guarded the entrance to the long-abandoned subway, the settling ground for the disease. Having the means to achieve his goal, Allos ventures forth in search of the disease\u2019s hosts and, ultimately, the disease\u2019s own manifestations lurking deep within the tunnels.</p>\n\n\n<p>Facebook: Third Eye\u00a0Stout</p>\n<p>Instagram: @thirdeye_stout</p>\n<p>Twitter: @ThirdEyeStout</p>\n<p>Website: pestilencegame.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:01:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb9/eb9b8a4f1bc3c31906bfa18d65adced5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thirdeyestout"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
