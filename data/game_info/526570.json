It was meant to be just a prototype for creating other VN's afterward, but the project got so big and interesting that looked it would be a shame not to be developed into a full VN.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In Just Friends, you'll play as Aiden, a human that had the lucky chance to spend some days at a good resort by his boss's recommendation. With this little vacation, he will have the chance to relax and forget about work and life issues, the only probable issue is the time. Aiden has only three days to be at the resort, but is that enough time to make some friends? Between so many possibilities, will Aiden be able to make any memorable memories? That's only for him to find out.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Features of the demo 0.45:</p>\n<ul><li>Two routes to play with two entire days to dive into their story.\u00a0</li><li>Each route is individual, you won't find the tiger into the dog's route or vice-versa.</li><li>A gallery that unlocks any backgrounds you'll see during your gameplay.</li><li>A Music Player for you to listen to any of the game songs.\u00a0</li><li>A good log system for you to read the last 100 dialogs.\u00a0</li><li>The game scales automatically for you to play at free windowed mode or full-screen.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>This is an ongoing project.
