It\r\nis the year AD 396.</p>\n<p>The occupying Imperial forces are beginning to lose their support from\r\nRome and are busy preparing for an orderly withdrawal. Already their\r\ninfluence is contested. Pockets of resistance are forming in some remote\r\nareas.</p>\n<p>This is of great concern to many inhabitants. The educated elite\r\nand the Christian orthodoxy have largely benefited from Roman\r\nrule. There is fear of reprisals, revolt and invasion.</p>\n<p>For others, it will be a chance for power and riches. To forge trade\r\nwith Franks and Danes. A time to claim back the land from our oppressors.</p>\n<p>The source code is available here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b08/b083b20c7433748e1418a280d0cd0aa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tundish"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
