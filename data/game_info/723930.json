But if the food or part of the snake happens to fall outside the window while you're resizing it, the game will crash)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T08:06:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ac/5accfac75ab8eb22d5b516f6556c4b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moazoom"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
