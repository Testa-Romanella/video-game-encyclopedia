My game uses Stronger Together in the fact that when your character is fully assembled together in one piece he will move faster and be able to maneuver around enemy fire but as he gets more broken down that speed decreases and it gets to a point where self destructing is probably your best bet. So by staying together you are literally stronger. You could also argue the enemies being packed up and using their unique weaponry and attack style could make them stronger as well. Its a lot easier to die when you have to focus on a smaller robot dog enemy charging at you while also being fired at from the enemies behind it.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know your thoughts on my first game in the comments.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n\n<p>All the songs are made by\u00a0Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio go check out their Youtube Channel this music seriously added so much to my game and I am very grateful this high quality of music is Royalty Free and free for everyone to use in their projects seriously go check out their channel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_6hQy4elsyHhCOskZo0U5g</p>\n<p>(small mistake on main menu \"The System Has Failed\" is also made by\u00a0Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio but it cut off Audio just clearing that up)</p>\n<p>Tools Used:</p>\n<p>Unity</p>\n<p>Aseprite</p>\n<p>Audacity</p><p>My friend's elbow (for the laser sound effect)</p>\n<p>Lastly thanks Brackeys and BlackThornProd for all their incredible tutorial videos they really helped me when I was stuck or didnt quite understand something.</p>\n<p>Also thank you to all the people in the discord that answered my questions when I was confused you really saved my project's life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:14:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/887/887a79eed7e2d31e5eb1302d1e370c36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BigPapaOcnarf123"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
