With just basic geometry, rigid bodies, and colliders.\u00a0</p><p>The \"goal\" for this Rube Goldberg Machine was to push the small cart at the bottom to catch the falling domino brick. I spent most of the time designing the model and figuring out the parameters for Rigidbody in order to make the catch. By using the two large pink spheres, I was able to create a relatively symmetrical process. Moreover, the bright pink color created a visual focus point hence emphasized the two sections (upper section for the falling brick and lower section for the cart) that were working simultaneously.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T04:45:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03f/03f92b7da92f89464d2cd325a83c122b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WAngieZhao"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
