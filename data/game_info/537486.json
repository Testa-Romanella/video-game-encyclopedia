This short Bitsy game is a messy mish-mash of some of my memories from reading the book and a bunch of ideas I had about an odd, small town of ghouls and kids next to a graveyard. Reading that book is absolutely <em>not</em> a prerequisite for the enjoyment of this game.<br/></p>\n<p>What to expect from Ilyusha's Limbo?</p>\n<ul><li>10-15 minutes of Bitsy gameplay (and a few surprises)</li><li>You can end the game at any point and restart anew by speaking to the phantom in the town's monastery. The goal is to explore the town and you can spend as little or as much time as you want.</li><li>An original, \"trash-can Animal Crossing\" soundtrack by me</li><li>Lots of bizarre sprite interactions</li><li>RIYL: the Pathologic games and/or the chaos and whimsy of Chibi-Robo's character interactions</li></ul>\n<p>special thank you's to</p>\n<ul><li>Adam for Bitsy</li><li>David Mowatt for the bitsymuse hack</li><li>Vladimir Nikolic for the Leben font</li><li>the late Sheldon Kopp and his Eschatological Laundry List (1974) which I used for text in the Maze Of Eschatology</li><li>and - last but not least - the late F.M.D. for the Bros Karamazov and all of the other unforgettables</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T04:37:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee6/ee6723f532d27624dc81fa976422f769.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["obliviist"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
