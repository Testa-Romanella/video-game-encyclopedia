Stingy Jack was the meanest, toughest, and cheapest person in all the land. He bargained his way out of every debt, and he stole everything he could. The Devil wanted to see this for himself, so he made his way to Stingy Jack. He watched him all day and all night and saw everything he had been told. The Devil made up his mind, a man like Jack did not deserve to live. He waited in an alley, and as Jack came around the corner, he sprang! \"Stingy Jack!\" the Devil roared \"I have witnessed your sin and have come to claim your soul!\" Jack was neither frightened nor surprised, for knew this day would come. He simply took a last look around and a deep breath. \"Devil?\" Jack asked \"May I have one dying wish? I wish to go bowling one last time before I am taken.\" The Devil pondered this for a second, and saw no harm in granting Stingy Jack his wish. When they reached the bowling alley, Jack shared with the Devil a scheme. If the Devil were to transform himself into a bowling ball, neither Jack nor the Devil would have to pay for their game. The Devil loved this, and greedily turned himself into a bowling ball. Quickly, Jack pulled out a small silver cross and stuffed it into the bowling ball, trapping the Devil. Having outsmarted the Devil, Stingy Jack played as much bowling as his heart desired.</p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY:<br/></p>\n<p>Jack-O-Bowling is a sandbox bowling game.
