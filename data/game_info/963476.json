When your smartphone breaks and your internet connection goes down, it's up to you to reclaim your bandwidth using obsolete and outdated tech around your house. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith plot and narration inspired by classics such as The Stanley Parable, Call Hating is a work-from-home simulator wrapped in an escape room, stuffed with minigames, and baked in a 500-degree oven of dark and fourth wall-breaking humor.
