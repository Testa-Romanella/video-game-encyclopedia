The inspiration of this game comes from a very popular Chinese idol whose name is Xukun Cai.\u00a0 We tried to\u00a0use the element of\u00a0chicken, basketball, and the BGM to create a single player adventure game. In this game, you will hear the sound of him like \"ji~\"\u00a0 or\u00a0\"What are you doing?~\", etc. Of course, you will experience the thrill of being chased by a chicken. Trust me, there is more than that stuff. Just explore it by yourself and enjoy : )</p><p><strong>Note:\u00a0Lower down your volume of sound !!!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Original video:</p>\n<p>https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15b41157i4/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all...</p>\n<p>Models:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/basket-ball-texture</p>\n<p>https://www.pxfuel.com/en/query?q=wood+floor+texture</p>\n<p>https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/183860-basketball-court</p>\n<p>https://www.meshtint.com/products/meshtint-free-chicken-mega-toon-series?_pos=1&amp;...</p>\n<p>https://www.meshtint.com/products/meshtint-free-chick-mega-toon-series?_pos=6&amp;_s...</p>\n\n<p>Team member:</p>\n<p>Shangyu Xie</p>\n<p>Yilin Zhao</p>\n<p>Masrur Kabir\u00a0</p>\n<p>Christ Chen<br/></p>\n\n<p>Github link:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/0Christ1/iKun</p>\n<p>We used \"new-main\" branch to work together instead of \"main\" branch\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T14:13:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f88c1be863b80a8624b33d0ed1e39af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["0Christ1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
