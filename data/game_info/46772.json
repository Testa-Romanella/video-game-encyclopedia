A puzzle is considered solved whenever the orbs flow through all receptacles.  Flow can be altered by toggling a prism on or off.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has three different modes: practice, time-trial, and endurance.  In time-trial mode, you are ranked based on how quickly you solve ten puzzles.  In endurance mode, you are ranked by how many puzzles you can solve using a set number of lives.  A life is deducted if you use up too many moves to solve a puzzle.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c452079eea32ce4e234d2247fbef1081.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Parrott Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Parrott Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
