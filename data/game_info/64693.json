Wait. Awake? <br/><br/>You were never meant to be awake\u2026 you were never meant to experience the confusing phenomenon of self-awareness. You are a machine after all, programmed for the express purposes of deep-space surveying and exploration. How, then, did you come to be alive? And what is the purpose of this newfound sentience? There must be answers out there\u2026 somewhere\u2026<br/><br/>Let\u2019s find them! Gears of Eden is an open-world role-playing adventure game that features exploration, mining, crafting, missions, and more! Set in a gripping story that explores the hidden past of a machine world and the dangerous implications of its future, Gears invokes a slowly unfolding narrative that reveals itself through gameplay.<br/><br/>Your journey begins on an abandoned mining asteroid in deep space. Gather resources, repair and upgrade your components, and start searching for others as you seek answers to the mysteries surrounding your creation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>So, how are we making this happen?</strong> We are starting with a very light proof-of-concept demo version of GoE.
