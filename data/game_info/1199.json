This was in the 60&amp;#39;ies of the last century. Since then a lot has changed, but many of us remember the days when there was no Graphical User Interface.<br/><br/>This app now is introducing DOS for mobile devices. Not laptops, but phones. iPhone and iPad, to be precise. It is a perfect emulator of the DOS that so many games and applications in the 80&amp;#39;ies and 90&amp;#39;ies have been running on.<br/><br/>Win and Win95 were running on DOS, showing what a 16bit operating system is capable of. If sys ini, commanc.com, config.sys and .exe sound familiar to you, then this is the app for you.<br/><br/>The DOS is not just a CLI, it is a full fledged operating system. It does everything that the Ancient DOS did. It is capable of executing batch files or installing some of the game classics that never made it past DOS. It probably runs much better than the original DOS used to run on old PC&amp;#39;s, which were state of the art back then.<br/><br/>30 years is old enough to be called vintage, and it brings as much power as it did back then ;-) With this app you can get this vintage feeling on your iPhone or iPad.<br/><br/>\u25c6Features<br/>    \u25b8 SoundCard emulation<br/>    \u25b8 External Bluetooth Keyboard<br/>    \u25b8 Disk Operating System<br/>    \u25b8 Everything you would expect from DOS ;)<br/><br/>If you have ideas, feedback, suggestions or anything else you would like to tell us, do not hesitate to drop us a line!<br/><br/>And if you like Power DOS, be not shy to leave a good review!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50a/50a9ee77f7db4bb05be987dfed4c530d.jpeg", "website": "http://www.pilcrow.ch/power-dos/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Pilcrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Pilcrow"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
