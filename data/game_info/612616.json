I used Blender to create the models, character, and animations\u00a0and Unreal Engine for everything else. I used Unreal Marketplace assets to build the map as well.\u00a0The goal is to find 3 keys and make it to a secret room to escape. Your health constantly goes down and your stamina decreases when jumping. There are health and stamina pick ups with sound effects. There is also a\u00a0light switch to turn on lights in a dark hallway and the electrical box has lighting effects (sparks).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:39:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd16f61b388c9296a4bea27f0a92da7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tbrooks3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
