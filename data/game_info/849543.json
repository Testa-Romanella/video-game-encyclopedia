This game generally has the same mechanics as the original, but has different stages and some different aesthetics.</p>\n<p><em>One Shot Plus</em> is a puzzle game where you aim the launcher and shoot the ball for the goal. Occasionally the rotation or launch power will be randomized, so the player will not always have complete control of the launcher. The game provides stages in a random order, and ends if the player runs out of time or misses the goal. The ending screen will tell the player how many rounds they successfully completed.</p>\n\n<p>The controls are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Rotate Launcher</strong>: Move Mouse</li><li><strong>Adjust Power</strong>: Square Brackets (\"[]\")</li><li><strong>Launch Ball</strong>: Left-Mouse Click\u00a0</li><li><strong>Pause</strong>: [P] Key</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T05:36:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/817/817bf5acde153bd54389b7bf69f34f5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mecha-rm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
