It's not meant to be used normally but use it if you want to understand how the game works or if you just want to cheat, it's ok :)</p>Notes<p>This game have been made for the <strong>Trijam #193</strong>, in 5h of devtime, 2h of asset making and 1h of trying to make music. My goal was to do &gt;3h devtime and &gt;3h art, but I was feeling that the game was a bit hard to understand so I took some time to polish it. If the game is still to hard to understand, don't hesitate to cheat!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T05:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e9d4bde732a2b373e5bed106c8e2548.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Martin Cirice"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
