To do the basic groundwork of the game I used one of Brackeys tutorial\u00a0 series, but I added my own spin to it especially as the game goes on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u2019m still new to game development, so there\u2019s a lot that I\u2019d like to add and would\u2019ve added if I made this game now. However, I want to submit what I have here since it is a full experience that I am proud of, and move onto the next project. And I may update it later on.</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4a/b4ad408225b0a63772b6fbff694e868a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["noahaslan"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
