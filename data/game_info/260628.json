It seems like you do not know your audience very well.}<br/>{BeginWriting.formalOpen: Your opening sentence gets right to the point and your tone starts off as professional.}<br/>{Write1.active1: You announced your intention with the active voice, so it seemed as if you are taking responsibility for your own mistakes. It is a good start.}<br/>{Write1.passive1: You used the passive voice in the second sentence, so it seems like you are trying to remove yourself from blame by saying 'the essay couldn't be finished' instead of 'I didn't finish the essay'.}<br/>{Write1.buriedSubject: I was very confused by your letter. You buried your real subject inside the middle of this list of other things. I had to figure out that you were trying to ask for an extension. You should've just stated your subject upfront.}<br/>{Write2.logicalEvidence: Your evidence was very good. You had an example to back up your claim, and the article was written by a professor who applied the techniques in her own classroom, adding more validity.}<br/>{Write2.uncitedEvidence: Your evidence is good but you do not provide any sources. I am not sure if you are just making up your claims. Make sure you cite next time. }<br/>{Write2.emotionalEvidence: I can tell you are trying to appeal to my emotion. While I sympathize with you, this is probably not the best choice. Remember your audience when you choose your evidence. I am not easily swayed that way. }<br/>{Write2.badEmotionalEvidence: An emotional appeal wouldn't work on me anyway because I am your professor, but even if it did, you overdramatize your problems and it's hard to take you seriously. I am less inclined to sympathize with you when you come across as too over-the-top.}<br/>{Write2.noEvidence: You don't give me any reason as for why I should heed your request.}<br/>{Conclusion.commasplice: You have a comma splice in your last sentence. It weakens your point by making you look like a bad writer. I am less inclined to be lenient if you couldn't even proofread this. }<br/>{Conclusion.runon: It seems like you didn't even proofread this. This sentence just goes on and on. It is obviously a run-on and you aren't really saying anything either. }<br/>{Conclusion.goodend: Courteous ending. I like it.}<br/>{Picture.catPhoto: It seems you are trying to make me more sympathetic to your cause with the cat. The photo is cute but it won't earn you extra points with me.}<br/>{Picture.mentalHealthPhoto: The graph is a good addition. It conveys the data in an easy-to-read form and adds well to your argument. }<br/>\"</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he cannot give you an extension because your request is extremely last minute and unfair to other students, but at least you got some comments on your writing!</p>\n<p>Apply these lessons to Writ107T when you retake it next quarter.</p>\n<p>-&gt; END</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["danielshu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
