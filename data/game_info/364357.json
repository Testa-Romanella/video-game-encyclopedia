We had 2 days to create a game based on the theme \"Unexpected Combinaison\" using only Kenney's assets.</p>\n<p>Here is the list of all assets I used:</p>\n<ul><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/weapon-pack\u00a0</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/rpg-audio</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/furniture-kit</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/3d-characters</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/smoke-particles\u00a0</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/castle-kit</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/medals</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack-rpg-expansion</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/ranks-pack</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/fantasy-town-kit</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/medieval-town-base</li></ul>\n<p>Sadly the lack of time made me rush this game, hence the lack of content\u00a0and overhall quality. Only 1 map out of\u00a0 5 and\u00a01 type of ennemy out of 4 made it out. The story is\u00a0poorly explained, and\u00a0characters lack\u00a0animations. Please keep in mind that this game is the result of a 1 man team\u00a0 over 2 days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T05:58:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/307dead2ee8a499f202f4a3f5ce783e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sebastien Awali"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
