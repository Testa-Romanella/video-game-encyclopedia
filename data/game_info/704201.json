Each player has 30 units (5 * 6) and 5 cities in his supply. Divided into meele and ranged units. Combat is split into two phases, meele and ranged. Meele units fight first but only have a range of 1 field, while ranged units go second but can control the board with a large range of 3 fields. Every unit attacks all fields on the board in its range in a clockwise motion. While each unit and city has 3 life points, the different types of units damage each other differently in a rock-paper-scissors system. Each round players alternate placing 1 unit, another unit and 1 city. If at the end of a round after the combat phase a player has more cities on the board than his opponent, he receives 1 point for each of those cities.The game ends when white has no more units in his supply at the beginning of a round or one of the players has no more cities on the board and in his supply at the end of a round. When the game is over, the player with the most points wins.</p>Buy the physical Board Game\r\nRoadmap\r\n<p>- Singleplayer against AI opponent</p>\n<p>- Online challenges additionally to random matches</p>\n<p>- Save and resume online matches<br/></p>\n<p>- Tutorial</p>\n<p>- Local multiplayer</p>\n<p>- Different translations</p>\r\nCredits\r\nGame Icons from https://game-icons.net\r\nIcons made by\r\n- Lorc, http://lorcblog.blogspot.com\r\n- Delapouite, https://delapouite.com \r\n- Carl Olsen, https://twitter.com/unstoppableCarl", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:48:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c9f9be4364d6e84c06af73b9ef1335a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["fortytwoboxes"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
