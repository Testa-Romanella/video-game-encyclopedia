The tribe was peaceful and lived in harmony with nature. However, one day, a pack of wolves started attacking the tribe, destroying their homes and hunting their livestock. The villagers were afraid and didn't know what to do.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the village lived a shaman, who was known for his deep connection with the spirit world. The tribe turned to him for help, hoping he could save them from the wolves. The shaman agreed to help and set out into the forest to seek the help of the spirits.\r\n</p>\n<p>After several days of deep meditation and communication with the spirits, the shaman returned to the village with a plan. He gathered all the villagers and told them to prepare a feast. On the night of the feast, the shaman performed a ritual that called upon the spirits to protect the tribe from the wolves.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T05:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad5/ad5d9b5176240394824e650d66e51089.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alifadil"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
