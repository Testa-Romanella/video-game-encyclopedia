Every time AllfredOne spawn a clone he gives to him a part of his <strong>skills and statistics</strong> and can regain them only when re-merge with the clone, but seeing that AllfredOne likes to do nothing is not a big deal for him.\r\n</p>\n<p>You and your friends <strong>play as AllfredOne\u2019s clones</strong>, and your work is to <strong>accomplish</strong><strong> all the </strong><strong>tasks</strong> AllfredOne will give to you.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Cooperation</strong> and collaboration are the key for <strong>success</strong>, as any task will ask you and your friends to <strong>pull from a shared set of resources</strong>. Be too greedy and your teammates will not have enough of them to complete their job, be too generous and you will not have enough.\r\n</p>\n<p>In both cases someone will have to go back and forth asking for stats\u00a0 losing a lot of time, and <strong>time is not on your side</strong> because AllfredOne loves<strong> taking naps.</strong>\u00a0Every time he <strong>falls asleep</strong> all the <strong>clones will disappear</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Team members:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Roberto Buratti</li><li>Diego Zucca</li><li>Luca Squadroni</li><li>Jose Alvaro Flores Gambarelli</li><li>Giorgio Castiglioni</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T10:56:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/01617c4e4db23fd866aecaecbae0843e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
