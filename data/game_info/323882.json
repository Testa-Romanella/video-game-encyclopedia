You take control of Corious, a space-wandering tinkerer looking for signs of life, until his spaceship crashes on a deserted shattered world.<br/>\r\nThe core game loop consists of platforming as well as solving puzzles using little robots called minibots, which Corious discovers on the first level. The player is able to send out minibots at any time and take full control of them. The goal of the game is to reach the end of each level in order to pick up a new spaceship part to repair it.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>This game is playable with keyboard &amp; mouse as well as XInput controllers</p>\n<p>If you do not own a XInput controller, you can use this emulator to play the game with your controller: https://github.com/x360ce/x360ce#readme<br/>\n</p>\r\n\r\nAction            | Keyboard     / Controller\r\n_____________________________________________________\r\nMove Character    | WASD         / Left Stick\r\nMove Camera       | Mouse        / Right Stick\r\nJump              | Spacebar     / A-button\r\nZoom              | Mouse Scroll / Triggers, Bumpers\r\nSend out minibot  | LMB          / X-button\r\nHack              | E            / X-button\r\nBomb              | RMB          / B-button\r\nBounce            | LMB          / Y-button\r\n\r\nMinibots\r\n<p>The minibots have three unique abilites:</p>\r\nHacking\r\n\r\nBombing\r\n\r\nTrampoline\r\n\r\nWho are we?\r\n<p>Instance Games an indie game developer that brought together two student teams to create a larger game like All That's Left.
