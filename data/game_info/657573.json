That's the first thing that came to my mind when I saw that the theme for the Brackeys Game Jam #6 was chaos, I mean, a bunch of stuff blowing up in space seems pretty chaotic to me.</p>\n<p>The controls are pretty simple, Use the arrows or WASD to move the ship and space to shoot. There are some problems that I'll try to solve later, but the core gameplay is working for as long as I tested it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T04:06:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b5/2b5b7db2f77169d8c1b9341a731e3bd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alan Diniz"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
