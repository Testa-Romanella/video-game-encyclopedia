It was pretty fun to do, given that this was done in 3 days ^^.\r\nWe just implemente the features of serving and recieving from the other team, you cannot play beyond that point.\r\nThe point is that you can serve the ball and win the game by\u00a0making an ACE serve or lose the game if u send the ball to a player of the other team. You can switch between camera angles (even first person) but I recomend using the '1' when aiming.\r\nSpeaking of aim, you can change the direction, spin and power of your serve by pressing X or C and dragging the mouse.\r\nIf you have any doubt, press H to show all the things u can do in this 'demo'.\r\nAnyways, i hope you like it (?) even thought it's not even a full game itself XD\r\nFeel free to leave any comment or feedback!\r\nAlso his project\u00a0was made with Processing and we are only using math for everything (even the camera movement\u00a0with mathimatical matrix)\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n~Marc Romera\r\n~Ryan Palaz\u00f3n", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T04:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/473/47307a0011873c464a495532783ac936.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Marc Romera Rodriguez"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
