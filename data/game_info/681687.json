Because it is still in experimental you will need to do a few things to get it up and running.</p>\n<p>Setup Quest</p>\n<p>1) Enable Experimental Mode with the ADB command in SideQuest by clicking the icon in Sidequest's header in the top right and running \"shell setprop debug.oculus.experimentalEnabled 1\". This needs to be done after each reboot.</p>\n<p>2) Optional, but needed for big houses, disable guardian in quest settings after you have you floor height.</p>\n<p>Game Instructions</p>\n<p>1) Place nodes at each corner of your walls and doors with the right trigger going counter clockwise. If you put one in the wrong place, just click X on the left remote to clear them out.</p>\n<p>2) Press A on the right controller to Lock In your play area and walls. This will also start the game and dim the light.</p>\n<p>3) Press B on the right controller to turn on your flashlight. Use it to kill the enemies that are now spawning faster and faster and coming to find you. Just hold the light on them for 5 seconds.</p>\n<p>4) If the enemies get too close you will loose health and the game will stop and show your score. Restart with A on the right controller.</p>\n<p>Only Tested on Oculus Quest 2 running v33.</p>\n<p>Must have at least oculus fw version 32.</p><p>Zombie credit to\u00a0Dmitriy Dryzhak</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:13:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bb/9bb061543d435dbdf0b0c7c316c28185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["cazforshort"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
