I had wanted to try and make it all lore based, having it as a sort of mystery of what the Labyrinth is, which I think I conveyed.</p><p>I would have left it at just lore, but the way I implemented it, through conversation, naturally added to creating character based narrative design. So I decided to make the characters and their personality and then have them tell the lore, their version of it to show how the lore isn't just the history, but how the characters have grown into this history, what they know of their history and all.</p><p>I also tried to implement the \"Joker\" optional theme, however I'm not exactly the funniest, so I don't know how it sounds.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:26:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/1175e8454b362a618c6e6ed8849cc3d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deaglan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
