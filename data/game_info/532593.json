At night, they reached your castle, surprising everyone unprepared.<br/>Fleeing was the only option for these people and their king, as they did not own any weapons to defend themselves and defeat those monstrous creatures.</p>\n<p>Time had passed and after hiding from the pigs for so long, a citizen of your former kingdom crossed your path. He claimed to own a weapon, made to defeat the intruders but unfortunately he was not capable of using the mighty weapon himself.</p>\n<p>He handed you the weapon and suddenly what seemed like an electric current, started running through your veins! You swung the hammer around as if you hadn't done anything else in your life. It was at this moment you knew that you would take back your kingdom by defeating every single one of them!</p>\n\n<p>Asset pack\u00a0used: \"Kings and Pigs\"\u00a0by\u00a0PixelFrog here on itch.io<br/><br/><br/>Side note...:<br/>As this is my first game there may be bugs or features missing which would be obvious to someone else. This game was created as part of my university project I had to make because I've started studying game programming.<br/>I'll try to come back to this project in the future and expand it, or even to tidy up the code, as may not be perfect. But for now, this is the project I\u00a0handed in.<br/></p>\n<p>And given, that I\u00a0never touched Unity and C# before while creating this in 1,5 to 2 month... I like it \ud83d\ude42</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T04:31:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84d/84d115d06089bdd372efbc5970847b80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DustyJinx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
