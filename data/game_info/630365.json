You can do nothing, and see how people are vaccinated, thanks to the random camera that shows you the flow. Or you can press a key (any key) and see how you, an experimented troll, are vaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>But what you CANNOT DO is to click any key more than one time. Don't do it. You're a troll, and it will be dangerous.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T17:04:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50a/50a8ce5d862f7c3fe2a8cb6d6decfab8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josep Pons"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
