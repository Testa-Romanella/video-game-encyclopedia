If those spaces are occupied, another adjacent space is chosen.</li><li>The starting size ghost (I'll refer to it as a 4ghost since it contains 4 ghosts of the smallest unit, so an Nghost is made of N of the smallest units) can be split into two 2ghosts. Each 2ghost can be split into two 1ghosts. <strong>If a 1ghost is killed, the level restarts - you need all four 1ghosts to be fused back together to a 4ghost\u00a0to unlock the \"4\" doors at the end of each level.</strong></li><li>Fuse smaller ghosts together by moving ghosts of the same size into each other. Fusing two Nghosts creates a 2Nghost where they meet.\u00a0A 2ghost and 1ghost can't fuse.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Formations</p>\n<p>When you unlock formations, you can arrange the ghosts into specific patterns to use each formation's abilities. Note that for Mirror and Unity formations, there needs to be exactly 2 ghosts onscreen. (If you have 4 ghosts, positioning 2 pairs into either Mirror or Unity formation won't work)</p>\n<ul><li>Mirror formation: With exactly 2 ghosts, arrange ghosts diagonally to each other. Reflect purple projectiles on contact.</li><li>Unity formation:\u00a0With exactly 2 ghosts, arrange ghosts adjacent to each other (horizontal or vertical). Absorb green projectiles on contact. When you have energy stored, press J to release an attack in a 1x1 box around you (like the king in chess)</li><li>Phalanx formation: Arrange 4 ghosts into the corners of a cross (North East West South, or like the buttons on your d-pad) to defend against all types of damage, including bombs.</li><li>Blade formation: Arrange 4 ghosts in a horizontal or vertical line and press J to slash in the direction of your line. The attack is extremely far-reaching.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Good to know</p>\n<ul><li>You can split into as many as 4 ghosts. If any of these smallest ghosts dies, the level will restart since you need all 4 of you to continue.</li><li>To get to the next level, the door's lock needs to get unlocked and you need to fuse back to a single ghost.</li><li>There isn't a special significance to a small ghost and a medium ghost sharing the same grid cell, but it can help speed up fusing.</li><li>Brute force can often work, but I encourage you to try to find elegant solutions.</li><li>An easy way to tell which level you're on is by looking at the red/blue banners next to the level entrance. Red banners represent 1 level cleared, and blue banners represent 3 levels cleared. For example: if you see 1 blue banner and 2 red banners, you've cleared 1*3 + 2*1 levels and you're on level 6.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>(Soul Thief Games)</p>\n<ul><li>Zenryoku: Game Director, Concept &amp; Design, Programming, Writing, Music (ending song)</li><li>Nelson MacPherson: Character Portrait Art, Character\u00a0Sprite Art</li><li>pope: Music (the entire game)</li></ul>\n\n<p>(Other wonderful people)</p>\n<ul><li>Dungeon RPG Tileset by Rekkimaru</li><li>Minifantasy - Dungeon Audio Pack by Leohpaz</li><li>Universal UI/Menu Soundpack by Ellr</li><li>2d pixel art game spell/magic FX by ppeldo</li><li>Key Items 16x16 by DantePixels</li><li>Dungeon Tileset II by 0x72</li><li>Cute Bomb Character Sprite by Caz Creates Games</li><li>openmoji.org</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T05:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf5/cf560e079f360087226ca695379eaffa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zenryoku@soulthiefgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
