I've taken the Jam\u00a0theme of \"Only One\" and applied it to a turn-based\u00a0RPG! You've got to cue-up the right combination of one-off moves and unleash them to beat the enemy! But watch out! The enemy has one turn too! At the end of the round, you need to have more HP than the enemy. Also you need to be, you know, alive. Search the world to know what moves the enemies have!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is exclusively played with the mouse and the left mouse button (\"Only One\" input). Click where you want to move to, click green capsules (NPCs) to initiate conversation, click anywhere on screen to advance text, click on red capsules (Enemies) to initiate combat, and use the UI buttons\u00a0everywhere else!</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As of right now, the game just doesn't work. Ran fine in the Unity editor, but as a build it doesn't.\u00a0If anyone has any ideas what's wrong, please tell me!.</p><p>There's no sound in this game, so don't worry about adjusting your speakers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:33:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d1/2d17a5ae58e20dc71594c50f03f1737f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Calvin And Hobbies"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
