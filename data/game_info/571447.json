Use Match-3 to activate skills, spells, combos and a team attack to decimate your enemies!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\r\nMatch3\r\n\n<p>The Match3/Turn Based mechanic is responsible for allowing the player to make actions and decisions to defeat the opposing team. The match system works where the player matches 3 of the same tile then once that has been achieved they can then match up to another 3 of either the same tile or a different tile. Example is matching 3 fire tiles then being able to match 3 air tiles after. So long as the player has mana they match tiles in any direction to their heart\u2019s content (e.g., Max mana is 10 then players can match up to 10 tiles at a time).</p>\n\r\nSkills\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Continuing on, this is where the activation of skill come in according to their tile requirement, Air + Fire = Backstab and etc.</p>\n\r\nCombos and Skill Intensity\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>The combo and intensity system also come to play in this point. Players being able to match a number of tiles at a time will allow them to cast multiple skills at once but for the skills activate they have to be in the EXACT order of the required tiles (e.g., Fire + Air = Fireball while Air + Fire != Fireball).</p>\n\r\nStages\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>The player will have to play through multiple stages. The main goal of each stage will always be to defeat the opposing team. As the player moves on to new stages different enemies will propose new challenges to the player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T09:31:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba1/ba15c2f05f60cd995c7582901cbd3f2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jops", "Kinsworth", "Benilde GameDev"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
