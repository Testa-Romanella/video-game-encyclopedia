Pong: Revived is a remake of the classic 1972 arcade game by Atari for Mac. The mechanics of this game should need no explanation, but if\u00a0you somehow haven't heard of Pong, it's a game where you have two paddles controlled by two players and a ball. Move your paddle to hit the ball. If you miss, your opponent scores a point. First to 10 wins. The mechanics are a lot like tennis, except the net doesn't actually do anything.</p>\n<p>The game experience is highly customizable, including, but not limited to, colors, speeds, cheat codes, and backgrounds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43f803163c4a8f1cc29571e3bf98e239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Arc676"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
