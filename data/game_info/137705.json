She is scared and only you can save her!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The theme was \"Two Incompatible Genres\" so I\u00a0decided to make\u00a0a mixture of\u00a0<strong>Platformer\u00a0</strong>and <strong>FPS </strong>. You have to save the princess and get her out from the dungeon. Her arms get numb after drinking the potion of life. She quenched her thirst after drinking it but the outcome was horrifying. She lost the feelings of her arms. Now she asks your protection from the creepy monsters of the dungeons and puzzles to solve and get her out of the darkness.</p>\n<p>ALERT: This game is made by a single person who is an artist,sound,music,effects,level,UI and Programmer.</p>\n<p><strong>Audio</strong>: By me using Bosca Ceoil and last level track\u00a0from\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/gothicvania-town</p>\n<p><strong>Font</strong>:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/8bit-wonder.font</p>\n<p><strong>Art</strong>: Mostly by me using Piskel and some from\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/gothicvania-town</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects</strong>: By me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68d/68d217aeeb47469373283a3eccfe862e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VelocityEngine7"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
