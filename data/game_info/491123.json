Erich von Manstein, and attempts to win the game by sweeping the entire peninsula of Soviets. The Soviet player takes the role of the Soviet front commander(s) in the Crimea area, and is generally on the defensive (though often able to make telling counter-strikes), and must attempt to thwart his enemy\u2019s plans and hold out longer than happened historically.<br/><br/><br/><h3>A challenging strategic problem</h3>Be warned this is not an easy game to win as the Germans. The Soviet defender will dig in and make you fight to take the Crimea. You will need to make the most of your unit's abilities and bring overwhelming odds to critical points on the battlefield. <br/><br/>Game Scale: Each hex on the map equals approximately 7.5 miles/ 12 kilometers from side to side.<br/><br/>Units represent Division, Brigades, Regiments and Battalions that were present in the Crimea at this time.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T23:32:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfc/cfcc895aa5b73c5534466bab070380ed.jpg", "website": "http://www.yobowargames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Yobowargames", "BruinBearGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Yobowargames"], "esrb_rating": null}
