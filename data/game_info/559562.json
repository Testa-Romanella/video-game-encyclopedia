{"id": 559562, "slug": "ultra-gorilla-sphere", "name": "Ultra Gorilla Sphere", "name_original": "Ultra Gorilla Sphere", "description": "<p>As opposed to normal games where the player takes control of the character itself,\u00a0<em>Ultra\u00a0Gorilla Sphere</em>\u00a0has the player move their character around by tilting the world itself (the exception of this being\u00a0<em>Ultra Gorilla Sphere\u00a0Adventure</em>). By tilting the board at various angles, players can control the speed and turning of the character. The goal of each level is to reach the goal gate before the timer runs out, and without falling off the floor. Bonus points and extra lives can be increased by collecting bananas on the stage. Early games use traditional controllers to play while many recent titles utilize modern technology, such as the accelerometers of the Wii and iPhone titles. The gameplay is similar to\u00a0Atari Games' 1984 arcade video game\u00a0<em>Marble Madness</em>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:30:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6dca3714b00e008f680f494d72f64de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["keslo"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
