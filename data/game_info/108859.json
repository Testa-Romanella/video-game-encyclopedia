I decided to port <strong>Altair</strong>, a game from 1981 by the spanish company <strong>CIDELSA</strong>, which is a shoot 'em up with some interesting gameplay. It was finally the winner of the contest.</p><p>I released the game under the pseudonym <em>Inmensa Bola de Manteca</em>. When I was I child in Spain, as a joke, my friends used to say that the initials of the computer company IBM meant Inmensa Bola de Manteca (Immense Ball of Butter).</p><p>The game was programmed completely in <strong>Z80 assembly</strong>.</p><p>Later, I ported it to the Amstrad CPC.</p><p>The original game page is here: http://jorgicor.sdfeu.org/altair .</p>Emulate<br/><p>The emulated version that you can play here in the browser is the version for Spectrum. I am using the free software emulator JSSpeccy2 , but I had to revert to version 2.1 of this emulator (which does not play sound) because with sound there was a lot of strange noises in the last version.<br/></p><p>So you can play the game this way, but if you want a total faithful gameplay, and <strong>truly 80's arcade sound</strong>, I recommend instead using an emulator compiled for your operating system. For example, Fuse for Zx Spectrum emulation or Arnold for Amstrad.</p>Packages<p>Below you can find the <strong>Altair complete package</strong>. It contains the tape images to use with Spectrum emulators, disc images to use with Amstrad emulators and manuals in PDF, everything in Spanish and English.<br/></p>The <strong>Altair source code </strong>contains the complete source code of the game and tools required to build it except the assembler.
