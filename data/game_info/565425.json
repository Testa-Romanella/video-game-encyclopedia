Each game will pay homage to a different era in video game history. SAAW, believe it or not, was inspired by the Ultimate Play the Game series of arcade titles for the ZX Spectrum, and the title was clearly inspired by DOOM.\u00a0<br/><br/>SAAW unfortunately has no sound, I was planning on just adding sound effects but I didn't want it sounding empty, so it's better to have no sound at all, I guess. If a few people are interested I might throw in some sounds &amp; music later on.<br/><br/>Game II - [early 1980s]</p>\n<p>Total Dev Time: yeah about a week\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:03:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e47a84410ac5db2c4af92a45bb79a92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Astronaut Curve"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
