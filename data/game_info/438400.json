However, you should have read the fine print, because now you are forever indebted to the dragon and are in a little game to see how long you can run this shop before he burns it, and you, to the ground.</p>\n<p><em>Adventuring Supply Company</em> is a single-player business simulation game where you buy and sell items while dealing with events that happen while running a shop in a fantasy world. However, you also owe a dragon a lot of money, and must pay the installment at the end of the day, or else.</p>\n<p>The game was created by Dragon Mafia Studio, a team made up of Ball State University students Austin Tinkel, Daniel Gonzalez, Josh Johannsen, Katelynn Gossage, Matt Schrag, and Zachary Hughes in Unreal Engine 4\u00a0as part of a project for the CS 490: Software Development Studio in the Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>The target hardware is a 1080p monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
