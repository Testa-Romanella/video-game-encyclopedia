The theme inspired us to focus on leaks of emotion and information from strangers through eye contact. Using an eyetracker the player looks at aliens to elicit their personal stories. Aliens that the player doesn't listen to leave and new ones appear while a musician plays music to suit each of their moods.</p><p>The aliens' stories were provided by other participants at the jam who we recorded.<br/></p><p>CREDITS<br/>Lead Programmer, Game Designer: Oscar Losada<br/>Xtreme Programmer, Game Designer: Martin Andersen<br/>Producer, Artist, Sound Assistant, Game Designer: Elise Terranova<br/>Producer, Game Designer: Julia Lotzow<br/>Music Producer, Game Designer: Nino Vaskov<br/>Character Design, Game Designer: Zack Wood</p><p>Logo by Nordic Game Jam Logo Shop</p><p>Cast (Voice acting):<br/>God: Gregory Garcia<br/>Goiter: PJ<br/>Crazy: Magnus Elvstr\u00f8m Myr\u00e4lf<br/>Sexy: Nina Vinde Folkerson<br/>(Special thanks to Sandra Fagerli and Louise Lynggaard Olsen)</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"427\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/163150209\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p><p><p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/163150209\">Traingers - Nordic Game Jam 2016</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/eliseterranova\">Elise Terranova</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e6055fe002a23ae44dcd5d7a48efe2b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["julo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
