They were designed by the creators to provide support for the planets of each galaxy.</p>\n<p>In the galaxy N, inhabited by living creatures of a new form, an asteroid belt was discovered that threatens the existence of this species.</p>\n<p>Your spacecraft was sent to the above galaxy to clear space from asteroids and other space debris in order to prevent catastrophic consequences. During the transition between galaxies, the system of your ship failed and upon arrival you found yourself in the epicenter of an asteroid mass. The defense systems also could not withstand the onslaught of asteroid attacks from all possible sides, the ship was seriously damaged but managed to get out of the asteroid belt.</p>\n<p>In order to avert a galaxy-wide catastrophe, your ship needs immediate repair of failed parts.</p>\n<p>There are hundreds of workshops for the production of universal robots on the ship, many of which have not survived.</p>\n<p>Crew members went to the surviving workshops to ensure the birth and progression of the robots, so that they, in turn, could repair the ship for the mission was resumed.<br/></p>\n<p>You are one of the crew members. Upon arrival at the workshop, you need to manually produce the possible number of repair robots and escort them to the damage systems. There is not a minute to lose, the existence of the inhabitants of several planets depends on your actions.<br/></p>\n<p>[google translate]</p>\n<p>Good luck !!!</p>\n<p>Sources:</p><p>https://github.com/vito-Z80/Robro</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n\n<p>In each workshop, it is necessary to produce the required number of robots. The artificial intelligence of the newly created robots at the initial stage is set only for repair work, so in some cases you will have to direct the robots to the elevator shaft for them to go into outer space to repair parts of the ship.</p>\n<p>Many of the ship's internal security systems: guards, turrets, etc. are out of order and do not always behave adequately. You will be able to improve newly created robots to overcome broken systems.</p>\n<p>Your character can also be improved by finding various items on the ship.</p>\n<p>Control:</p>\n<p>cursor/space/ctrl/alt</p>\n<p>gamepad</p>\n<p>in game keys:</p>\n<p>escape - restart level.</p>\n<p>ctrl+q - to main menu.</p>\n<p>i - level task</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T00:52:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48ee54ed15c8ba5f7b1c7e0ad8a78d1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Serdjuk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
