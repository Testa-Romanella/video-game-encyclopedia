I really feel like it creates a gateway to my soul and, throughout my life, I haven't found many people with whom I've been able to share songs, not\u00a0in a way that makes me feel like they really understand what I'm trying to say through them.</p>\n<p>So I made this tiny game.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks toYago de Hita\u00a0 for his increidble support, and\u00a0Dan Cox, this game wouldn't have been possible without his amazing\u00a0Twine tutorials.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Note:\u00a0You will have to scroll down after every choice, since the chat window will go back to the top every time. I'm already working on fixing this thanks to the help of my beautiful friend\u00a0Yago, but as it is right now it can get a bit uncomfortable. I apologize and I hope you still enjoy it. :)</p>\n<p>Note II:\u00a0It's technically mobile friendly, but it's not super comfortable to play and some things may break due to the difference in resolution, so PC is the ideal platform to play this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T03:38:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dc/6dcab3af1c4a785a2954679502a6e6e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Misspeak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
