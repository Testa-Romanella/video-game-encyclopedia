Now it has mysteriously returned to the surface with its entire worker population replaced by a building full of ghosts.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt first the ghosts are hidden from sight. Follow your blinking proximity detector to track them down and zap them. And then run for your life! Because frankly, ghosts get really mad when you zap them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWork your way down through the building to the lower floors that are still deep underground. Interact with quirky characters, outwit puzzling levels, and unravel the sinister secret behind the building's return. Oh, and also avoid the internal defense systems of Building Six; the central computer is just as likely to consider YOU a threat as the ghosts. So that's helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHogogeist is a stealth/strategy game with moments of adrenaline-pumping chases. And if you're not careful, a healthy number of jump scares. Proceed with caution.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T02:06:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84b/84b09d403275010422911a40c2606c0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hogo Company"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hogo Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
