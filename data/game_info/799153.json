Snatch food and other items to give temporary boost to better your chances of survival, but be careful. One wrong move will make you fall to your unfortunate death.\r\n\r\nPower Up!\r\n<p>On you way up and up, use your tongue to grab power up to assist you in your adventure. Some will give you longer reach while might slow down platforms.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard:\r\n<p>Use A on keyboard to move Left</p>\n<p>Use D on keyboard to move right</p>\n<p>Left Click on Mouse to grapple on to platforms</p>\r\nMobile:\r\n<p>Use Left Arrow button to move left</p>\n<p>Use Right Arrow button to move right</p>\n<p>Tap on the platforms to grapple on to them</p>\n\r\nEarly Build\r\nCurrently this game is a very early build. There will be bugs and visual glitch but I do intend on fixes them soon. I might created a better grappling mechanic if it better the experience of the game. There will be much more to come like power ups, Particle effects, different type of platforms, maybe different ninja frogs. If you have an ideas please leave\u00a0\u00a0a comment and I will happily take it into consideration\u00a0<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T17:52:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dce/dcecb8d917132c7f4948de1406df53e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dumont Parker Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
