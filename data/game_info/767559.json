Theme: <strong>Delay the Inevitable</strong>\u00a0</p>\r\nTheme Summary\r\n<p>In this game you play a guardian angel trying to delay the inevitable things that happen to people. You cannot possibly delay them forever but you can attempt to hold these things off as long as you are able.\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The game is a hand/eye coordination challenge. You have to use your mouse and try to keep within the safe area while it moves around the screen. Each time you go outside you lose resources you need to keep delaying the inevitable. There are multiple levels and the difficulty ramps up on each playthrough.\r\n</p>\n\nGame Design Notes\r\n<p>I wanted a game mechanic that reinforced the theme. The best way I could think to do it was to have something that you would eventually fail. The goal being to delay the failure as long as possible.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each level is also a scenario that applies to the theme. I tried to give each scenario a pattern, sound and animations that worked together to create a separate concept in each one.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each playthrough increases in difficulty which means that you have a reason to keep going if you find the game enjoyable. It gets harder and harder as you progress.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T00:58:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5a8213e0e93d62a319c5c5504730c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["blockerz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
