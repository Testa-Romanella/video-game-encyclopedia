The idea behind it is pretty simple \u2013 we wanted to give you the opportunity to create a character and take them to the top of the wrestling world.<br/><br/>How do you do that? By getting yourself over. Have great matches, cut promos and win titles. You get to train your wrestler, work for different promotions, upgrade your gear and even react to online gossip, rumours and innuendo. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. It\u2019s truly a unique game that hasn\u2019t been developed for the wrestling scene before.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to make it to the biggest promotion in the game and become their world champion.
