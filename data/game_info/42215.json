{"id": 42215, "slug": "dying-light", "name": "Dying Light", "name_original": "Dying Light", "description": "<p>Dying Light is a first-person action horror game with the elements of survival. It is a first part of the Dying light series followed by Dying Light 2. The game is set in the open-world environment of fictional Harran city. Players are offered to assume the role of an undercover agent Kyle Crane who has been sent in the quarantine zone. His mission is to find the rogue politician Kadir &quot;Rais&quot; Suleiman lost somewhere in the infected giant city. On the way to achieving the goal, Kyle will meet other survivors, who desperately try to stay alive among zombies. The chief game mechanic is running the generators and turning on streetlights throughout Harran to make another part of the map accessible and safe at nighttime. The game features day/night time cycles that change the game remarkably: the action becomes fast-paced, and all the infected people turn into dangerous zombies. Therefore, the gameplay is based on armed combat against mutants and Kyle\u2019s sneak and parkour skill for preventing it.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2015-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-10T05:31:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4a5/4a5ce21f529cf8fd4670b4c3188b25df.jpg", "website": "http://dyinglightgame.com/", "rating": 4.09, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 166, "owned": 2790, "beaten": 1171, "toplay": 150, "dropped": 409, "playing": 80}, "playtime": 22, "achievements_count": 488, "ratings_count": 1315, "suggestions_count": 682, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1334, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Techland"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Warner Bros.
