Rumored to be more machine than man, Booth has at his\u00a0disposal legions of\u00a0 autonomous War Machines left over from the War, with plans to build a\u00a0Neo Confederate empire\u00a0in the dusty plains of the\u00a0Southwest.</p>\n\n<p>Steampunk Lincoln is the brainchild of Brandon Watson, a 3D Artist and Game Developer. The game has been a passion project of mine that I've been developing in my spare time over the past year or two.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inspired by games like Dark Souls and Steamworld Dig, my goal so far has been to attempt to create a polished vertical slice of the game as a foundation for further updates and developments.</p>\r\nFuture Updates\r\n<p>Some of what I'm hoping to\u00a0including in future updates are:</p>\n<ul><li>Fleshed out leveling system and skill tree</li><li>More enemies, levels, and bosses</li><li>A mobile base that can be upgraded over the course of the game, in the form of an airship known as 'The Gettysburg'\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nMusic Credits\r\n<p>Trailer / Boss Battle Music :\u00a0\u00a0Spanish Matador Of 21 Century by\u00a0Alex Khaskin<br/>Trailer Music :\u00a0\u00a0Maple Leaf Rag by Scott Joplin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T05:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f3e1216968c89b3e0abe8d9eb4d8446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 461, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Doc Watts"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
