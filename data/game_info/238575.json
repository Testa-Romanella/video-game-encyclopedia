Art Game!</em>\n<p><em>This is an art game.\r\nThere is little gameplay, the beginning is a bit confusing and so is the end.\r\nThe middle requires player effort to untangle the story and figure out what is\r\nhappening! A single play through probably\u00a0lasts just over an hour (depending on how you play it).</em></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The gameplay is a\r\nsort of hybrid of point &amp; click adventure and first person shooter with the\r\nworld moving while the pointer (cross hairs) remain in the centre of the\r\nscreen. The core gameplay is the exploration of each screen by\r\nzooming in and out in order to navigate and search.</p>\r\nGame description\r\n<ul><li>An art game\r\nmeditating on life, after-death and consciousness. </li><li>A journey into space\r\nthrough a fragmented memory palace. </li><li>An illustrated\r\ninteractive prose poem of ambient moments. </li><li>Salvaging of self\r\nthrough the voice hidden in photomontages.</li></ul>\n<p>The game comprises\r\neight chapters, each a single searchable screen. There are 120 spoken fragments\r\nof memory scattered across the eight chapters that together conjure an\r\nimpressionistic story.
