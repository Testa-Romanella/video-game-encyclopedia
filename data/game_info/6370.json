Try 8 Knights, 4 Bishops, and 3 pawns \u2014 why not?<br/><br/>As heard on NPR's Weekend Edition<br/><br/>5 out of 5 Stars \"An essential puzzle experience for anyone even remotely interested in strategy games\" - TouchArcade<br/><br/>Whether you play chess daily, or quit just after learning the rules, this small twist will open the door to an entire new world of chess.<br/><br/>------WHATS IN THE \u201cBOX\u201d?<br/>The free version of Really Bad Chess lets you compete vs. an AI in Ranked, Daily, or Weekly Challenges.

Really Bad Chess removes these boring restrictions and flips chess on its head.<br/><br/>As much as random pieces change the game in some ways, I was really surprised to notice how much the game remains the same, and how powerful some pieces are \u2014 you've never truly struggled against a pawn until you've struggled against a pawn in the back row.<br/><br/>For chess pros, Really Bad Chess will give you a new type of challenge \u2014 the pieces &amp; the moves are the same, but you'll have to throw out your openings and your understanding of normal patterns of play. <br/><br/>For novice chess players (like most of us), Really Bad Chess greatly opens up the game. Instead of starting by studying openings, in your first games you'll get to discover the joy (and challenge!) of learning how to checkmate.<br/><br/>I hope you have as much fun with Really Bad Chess as much as I did making it.<br/><br/>-zach", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T09:07:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/52714b522542ee90240859eb67a9dfde.jpg", "website": "http://www.reallybadchess.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Noodlecake Studios", "Zach Gage"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Zach Gage"], "esrb_rating": null}
