All graphics, sounds and music have been updated. The game now has an isometric perspective and has 3 levels in different environments, following a loose story.\u00a0I have also made minor code modifications such as adding a boss door in level 3 which opens when only one enemy is remaining and an introductory screen for each level. Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Evan M Saarinen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T07:39:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/507/50704d2485e9a50764f5d20f855575f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["emsaarin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
