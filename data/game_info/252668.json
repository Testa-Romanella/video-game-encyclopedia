They tell you how to play. If there's something you're unsure about read below :)\u00a0</p><p>Instructions:</p><p>- The game is a simple plat former with two different mechanics for each player. The smaller player character can perform an electric slam on plant enemies as an attack while the larger \u00a0of the two relies on his shield to reflect attacks for extra damage. <br/><br/>- The game uses W,A,S,D for player 1 and Arrow Keys for player two.\u00a0</p><p>-Jumping: W or Up Arrow</p><p>-Running: A and D or Left and Right Arrow keys</p><p>- Small Player's Slam move: Jumping in the air followed with holding the down key will charge a slam up before the player rapidly falls on the enemy.</p><p>-Small Player's pick up: The Smaller player can pick up the larger one when it is in proximity by holding down the Down Arrow Key. To throw the larger Player press up. Note if you are moving the Larger Player will be thrown in that direction. <br/></p><p>-Large Player's Shield move: Holding down the W key to bring up the shield following with A and D to change the shields angle. Changing the angle will allow you to reflect projectiles back at the enemies. <br/></p><p>-Large Player's Double Jump move: While being thrown by the smaller player you can press the W again quickly to double jump to reach higher places. This only occurs if you are thrown.\u00a0</p><p>Note:\u00a0 The smaller player\u00a0 can only hurt Plant Enemies while the Stone Enemies and Mosquitoes and Plant Enemies can be hurt by the Larger player.\u00a0</p><p>The larger player is stronger but slower while the smaller player is nimble but more frail. <br/></p><p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to this. Enjoy. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d42/d42c7c9185ac68c7753c209eef83341a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pizza Time"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
