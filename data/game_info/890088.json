I have zero knowledge or experience and started this project while using the 20 day trial of MZ. Most of the game is pretty much RTP, pre-made maps, and such. Later half the game I started messing around with plugins and used some of Visustella's (https://visustellamz.itch.io/)  free plugins for some quality of life. I had a few friends test it and I fixed most issues when found. Please give it a try and I hope you enjoy it. It's not a full game since it's mostly made for me to learn, but it's a good solid hour or so.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>-Starting character choice between boy/girl<br/></p>\n<p>-Starting job choice Warrior/Sorcerer/Hunter/Bandit</p>\n<p>-Unlockable jobs Martial Artist, Paladin, Spell Fencer, Lancer, and Healer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T05:10:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d76a955ea62baaf1a645b05a8dc4d22f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CG_Sidd"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
