This game is based on high speed and momentum and it could be a good speedrunning game if it was good at all, but as I have to attend classes\u00a0 therefore I made this game in 2 days and\u00a0this game is currently in development, I will probably release a few updates and will add some more features in this game in future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.How To Play</strong></p>\n<p>w - Move forward</p>\n<p>s - Move backwards</p>\n<p>a - Move left</p>\n<p>d- Move right</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Ctrl - To Crouch</p>\n<p>Left Mouse click\u00a0- To use Grappling Gun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.About</strong></p>\n<p>There are 3 levels in this game and a hidden level which is really easy to find, sorry the options button in this game doesn't work.
