I thought I'd release the old version as it had several levels complete, and had a built in end goal already for a sort of demo. everything in this build represents about half a months worth of work give or take. It has a built in speedrun timer and death counter. I think my best was 0 deaths and 1:11 roughly, see if you can beat my time I guess?</p><p>Anyways, the new build is coming along well and being made even faster than this one mostly because its been months since I've made this version and I've learnt a fair amount. hope someone gets some kind of enjoyment out of this.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/870/8702b36a296fad77cb6782f027692a11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["calcium_chan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
