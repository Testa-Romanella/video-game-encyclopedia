Using only one button (or touch/tap!) you are able to lean forward and backward to keep your balance and maintain a healthy speed. Keeping your balance arrow in the green area maximizes your speed (distance traveled, score).</p>\n<p>Over time the amount of effort it takes to keep balanced starts to weaken your legs and it gets tougher and tougher to maintain balance.</p>\r\nHow far can you get with one wheel and one button?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64b/64b9f45982eb248da62ea0480597e2ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Kevin Whitmore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
