The main bit of the game is you and a mate (because I refuse to learn AI) have to fight each other using minecarts. Whoever reaches a score of five first wins the game. Pretty simple aye? There isn't much polish to it right now, and controls will be in the start menu. I'd love to hear suggestions and feedback on how I can improve it.</p>\n<p>There also isn't sound as trying to make that work has been far too stubborn for me to care.\u00a0 There are two players, Red and Green, gameplay should be about the same. The two minecart sized boulders next to the player is how much you have to throw at the enemy, two each. You can only move vertically. Cheers, and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Made using Pico-8, a fantasy console made by Lexowaffle\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:56:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f0/8f0956376a0b1cc02a839122efe5ae54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ATACOMANS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
