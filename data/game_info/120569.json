It is highly recommended that you play <strong>Sleepless Night</strong> and <strong>Sleepless Night 2: Ladies' Night(mare)</strong> beforehand. This story focuses on what happens in that time when the protagonist from <strong><em>Sleepless Night</em></strong> is asleep and the girls from <strong>Sleepless Night 2</strong> are having their ladies' night. It'll throw some light on the events from the two games and is some sort of prelude to the third and final <strong>Sleepless Night</strong> game. You will meet old friends and new enemies. </p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong><br/> What is Haru up to now? His friends are in danger, and he has to make an important decision. The true villain shows up and threatens Haru and all the people he loves. Can Haru find his friends in time to warn them? Will he find the answers in Shizuka's house, or in the forest?</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/> Story, characters, music \u2013 Marcel Weyers<br/> Character art \u2013 NoodleBrains<br/> Backgrounds \u2013 Auro-Cyanide, OokamiKasumi<br/> Additional graphics \u2013 Torsten Sohrmann<br/> Engine \u2013 Ren'Py</p>\n<p>German translation \u2013 Marcel Weyers<br/> Dutch translation \u2013 Bob Reus<br/> Italian translation \u2013 Armando \"FL3R\" Fiore<br/> Korean translation \u2013 hgdear</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong><br/> Title: Midnight Chaos<br/> Release: April 1, 2014<br/> Genre: Short story/Horror<br/> Rated: 13+<br/> Resolution: 1280\u00d7800<br/> Platforms: Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Linux<br/> Endings: 1<br/> Languages: Dutch, English, German, Italian, Korean<br/> Version: 1.3</p>\n\n<p>Since <strong>Midnight Chaos</strong> is a thank you to the fans of the series, I wanted to make it available who support the Sleepless Night series in some way. If you've created fan art, fan fiction, a translation of one of the games, or something else or have provided me with resources for the games and/or helped me with programming/art/testing, just send me a message and I'll send you a link to the full game. Of course, you can also create something new, it doesn't have to be super complex, just something small is good enough. I'll post fan art and other things on my website and link to a page of yours if you want.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c26/c2680ae0ca88a68a18e1fb06f117b529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcel Weyers"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
