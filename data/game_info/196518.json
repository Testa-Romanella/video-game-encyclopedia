But watch out for your opponents - they want to get a good hand as fast as possible as well. What colors do they collect? And will you do if the cards you need don't end up on the table? Every tactic is quickly adjusted and with a little bit of vision and luck you can score more points than the other players!</p>\n<p>The rules are simple and the rounds are quick and fun.
