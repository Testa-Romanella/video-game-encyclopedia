Get to him undetected.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Week11: 29.10-7.11.2018\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Constraints:\u00a0 Learn about mesh creation and simple AI\u00a0</p>\n<p>Core Dynamic: Stealth</p>\n<p>Summary: First idea was for the game to be a stealth game with logic puzzles. In the end I got a little sick, and despite having the idea sorted - I guess I hadn't thought it enough. Struggling a bit about what do I want to do I ended up deciding on what I want to learn during this project. By deciding on toying with custom mesh creation, simple paroling AI and tile system (which I ended up discarding) I finally started the real work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What went bad: I didn't thought through the idea at the beginning of the week - instead I started to work as Arnold Schwarzenegger says in his speech \"you can have the best ship but without specific purpose you will be drifting around\" - and that is what has happened. Lesson learned - I will sit and think and only when everything is decided\u00a0I will start doing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What went good: For the first time since the week#5 Western I had fun when creating the enemies, figuring out how to make mesh and especially adding sounds as the last touch.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67b/67b3ba9b3f556ca969e63e0ab6f74e39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunny Valley Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
