They will strike you and try to push you over the edge. You must remain on the ground and push them off in order to defeat them.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Modes:</strong></p>\n<p>Classic Mode -\u00a0 There are a total of 10 waves. If you defeat them all, you win. It is recommended that you finish this before trying out arcade mode.</p>\n<p>Arcade Mode -\u00a0 There is no limit to the number of waves. Your goal is to get as high of a score as you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>- Press WASD or ARROW KEYS to move around.</p>\n<p>- Press SPACE to use the green power up.</p>\n<p>- Press ESCAPE to pause and resume the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemy Health:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All enemies have their own health bars. An enemy's health will heal the longer you do not attack him. If it reaches 0, he will stop moving for a while, giving you a chance to push him off.</p>\n<p><strong>Power Ups:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Yellow\u00a0 -\u00a0 This makes you tougher. Your attacks will be stronger and attacks on you will be less effective.</p>\n<p>Red -\u00a0 This makes you fire bullets at all enemies, doing significant damage to them.</p>\n<p>Green -\u00a0 This allows you to jump up and smash down on the ground, damaging all the enemies who are near and pushing them away.</p>\n<p><strong>Score Rules:</strong></p>\n<p>In arcade mode the amount of score you gain depends on your current multiplier.</p>\n<p>Every time you defeat an enemy, your multiplier increases and the multiplier bar fills up.</p>\n<p>The bar will decrease over time, faster if you stay near the center. When it becomes empty, your multiplier will decrease.</p>\n<p>To increase your multiplier you must stay away from the center and defeat enemies as quick as you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music by Cyberleaf Studio.</p>\n<p>Sound Effects by Dustyroom,\u00a0Little Robot Sound Factory, and\u00a0cabled_mess.</p>\n\n\n<p>I am an 18 year old student at the time of releasing. I am learning unity and this is the first game that I have created after getting a basic understanding of the unity engine. The idea that I built up on\u00a0is from one of the\u00a0tutorial prototypes I used to get started in the engine.\u00a0I have worked hard to make this a fun experience and I hope that you will like it.\u00a0 :)</p>\n<p>I would highly appreciate your feedback down in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T16:37:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a2/4a2e0a30c8cd6281c49929033735c9d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ali Murtaza"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
