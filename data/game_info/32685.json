Prince of Persia 2 is, however, more combat-heavy than its predecessor. In the first game, enemies appear only occasionally and are always alone, while in the sequel, up to four enemies may appear at once, sometimes flanking the player, and may even be instantly replaced by reinforcements when they are killed. As in Prince of Persia, the trick is to complete the game under a strict time limit from 75 minutes in the game that passes in real time. Lives are unlimited, but time cannot be regained (except by reverting to a previously saved game). In other areas, more significant improvements have been made. The graphics are far more complex than the simple look of the game&#39;s predecessor, the areas explored are larger, and the variety of backdrops is greater.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-21T08:09:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cf8/cf8405de7a4470611fc501d565342e23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.81, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 22, "beaten": 32, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 28, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 48, "suggestions_count": 392, "game_series_count": 13, "reviews_count": 48, "platforms": ["SNES", "Classic Macintosh", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Broderbund Software", "Br\u00f8derbund", "Broderbund"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment", "Broderbund Software", "Br\u00f8derbund", "Broderbund"], "esrb_rating": null}
