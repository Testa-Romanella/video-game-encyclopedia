{"id": 432395, "slug": "mona-vr", "name": "Mona VR", "name_original": "Mona VR", "description": "<p>Since October 2019, the extraordinary fame of Mona Lisa has pushed the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre to try and implement additional safety measures. Now, visitors have to queue through barriers to see the painting. <br/></p>\n<p>The museum also presents an official virtual reality experience which allows the visitor to meet face to face with Lisa Gherardini herself, thus removing the crowd and the difficulty of access to the painting. Although the initiative is laudable and the experience remarkable, we can wonder: what if the current conditions of visit of Mona Lisa, however unpleasant they are, were actually part of the authentic Mona Lisa experience in the 21th century? <br/></p>\n<p>Through this experience, we deliberately chose to replicate the exact conditions of visiting Mona Lisa today, as a humourous, playful and imaginative way of reflecting about core concepts of cultural heritage : originality and authenticity.</p>\n\n<p>Any pictures or selfies you take are saved right next to the game's exacutable, in the \"Pics\" folder. Do with them as you will !</p>\n\n<p>This experience requires a VR headset ! It has been tested with HTC Vive and Vive Pro, but uses SteamVR, so it should also work with other headsets.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T13:05:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/257/25723801fd55bbf5ca58d0b859bb926f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piers Bishop", "Ma\u00eblys Jusseaux"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
