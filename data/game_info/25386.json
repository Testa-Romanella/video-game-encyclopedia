As in the original \n      Columns, jewels fall into a bin, and you have to twist and manipulate \n      them to form matches of three or more in a vertical, horizontal, or \n      diagonal line to keep the jewels from stacking up and reaching the top. \n      In Columns III, you can get special magical jewels that will do things \n      like raising your opponent\u2019s crush bar or lowering yours, adding an \n      extra element of strategy to the game. This is a great game to play with \n      friends, so download it today and jump into the action!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
