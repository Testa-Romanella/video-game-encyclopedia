I decided I wanted to make a video game for the project, so I asked her if I could, and she was like \"frick yeah dude\" (paraphrased). we only had a couple days for the project so if it looks unfinished that's why.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I will probably update it when I feel like it to polish it up a little. so check back every once in a while for that I guess.<br/></p>\n<p>This is actually the first game I've ever publicly posted believe it or not. I hope to keep improving at coding and all that jazz.<br/></p>\n<p>all the assets in this game were made by me, kermit is owned by disney I guess\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>(can disney sue me for this?)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T10:03:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fd/9fdb7ba9e062d7406ea6f39e713105a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Rex Doom"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
