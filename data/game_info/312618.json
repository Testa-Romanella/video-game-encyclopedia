It serves as a sequel (though probably taking place before, or possibly not) to the developer&#39;s first game, Middens, with several reappearing themes and characters.<br />\nSet in the same surreal dystopian setting as Middens, you play as Gingiva, a young woman with an old fashioned clock winding key for a head, who is essentially an enslaved automaton factory worker. The story begins with the &quot;Holy Mother Most High&quot; requesting your presence; when you speak with her, she accuses you of slacking off in your work, and has you thrown in prison.</p>\n<p>However, in your prison cell, you meet with a sentient, disembodied mouth referred to as &quot;the Chatterteeth&quot; who helps you escape. Now on the run from the evil corporate executives, you must make your way through a bizarre, corrupted world filled with danger, in a quest to regain both your freedom, and your humanity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T02:49:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/617/6174a9048b144a006ce525fa9089bf75.jpg", "website": "https://gamejolt.com/games/gingiva/17758", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": [], "developers": ["The Gunseed Collab"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Gunseed Collab"], "esrb_rating": null}
