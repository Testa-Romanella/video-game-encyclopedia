{"id": 624848, "slug": "covid-colony", "name": "Covid Colony", "name_original": "Covid Colony", "description": "<p>Covid Colony is a 2D platformer and shooter game combined with side-scroller mechanics and puzzle interactions. This game was created for GEMASTIK 13 competition by the <strong>OneShot team</strong> (Muhammad Luthfi Idrus, Raihansyah Attallah Andrian, Sayid Abyan Rizal Shiddiq). This game is also based in <strong>Bahasa Indonesia</strong>, however the mechanics (except the puzzle questions) can be played normally by using this english guide. This game was developed with the intention\u00a0to tell people regarding the dangers of covid and some ways to prevent spreading of this deadly virus through the various mechanics, gameplay, and stories present in the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>In covid colony you will play as a white blood cell named \"Putih\" working to cleanse the blood colony from the corona virus in the form of covid colony. Putih can shoot bullets of various types in order to kill the covid colony. However, covid enemies will also shoot at you!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p>In order to defeat the covid colony, you must <strong>cleanse </strong>every part of the body from enemies. Be careful, as in some of the areas powerful bosses are lurking to destroy the blood colony!\u00a0Will Putih be able to defeat the covid colony and save the blood colony from this dangerous virus?!</p>\r\nSkills\r\n<p>There are several skills that Putih can use to fight the covid colony.\u00a0 These skills vary depending on your situation and time of need. Of course, each skill will have cooldowns depending on how powerful they are.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: There are plans to further develop other skills and abilities which the main character can have. Some of these plans however will not be mentioned in detail here on the game page.</p>\r\nControls\r\nMovement\r\n<p>Use <strong>A</strong>\u00a0and <strong>D</strong> to move left and right respectively. Use <strong>W</strong> or <strong>SPACE</strong> to jump. Use <strong>S</strong> to go down from platforms that are thin (empty below the platform).</p>\n\r\nShoot\r\n<p><strong>Left mouse click</strong> on any part of the screen. Projectile will go from Putih's location to the clicked point. There is also a <strong>critical chance</strong> mechanic where each bullet may be able to deliver critical damage to covid enemies. Originally Putih will only have <strong>10%</strong>\u00a0chance to deliver critical hits.</p>\r\nHP Bar and Lives\r\n<p>Putih\u00a0will originally have <strong>100 HP and 3 live</strong><strong>s</strong>. Putih will lose a life (heart) if you fall or lose all HP in your HP bar. If Putih loses a life, then you will be <strong>respawned with full HP</strong> but <strong>losing one life</strong>. Losing all your lives will result in game over.</p>\n\n<p>There are <strong>interactions</strong> in the world where Putih can <strong>increase</strong> the\u00a0maximum HP and critical chance which will be explained further below. These stats can be seen in the <strong>pause menu</strong> by pressing <strong>ESC</strong>.<br/></p>\n\r\nAbilities\r\nWeapon Modifiers\u00a0\r\n<p>In this game, there are several type of weapons that Putih can use to shoot at enemies. These modifiers can be changed at any time and sometimes are needed to solve certain puzzles. You can unlock different modifiers by <strong>progressing through the story</strong>. Only one type of modifier is available from the start. Only <strong>one</strong> modifier may be <strong>active </strong>at one time.</p>\n<p><strong>1. The Basic Weapon</strong></p>\n\n<p>This type of modifier\u00a0is available from the beginning. This bullet is the normal bullet that can be used to shoot at covids. It has decent fire rate and <strong>small</strong> amount of damage.\u00a0You can select to use this modifier by pressing\u00a0<strong>1</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: In v1.0 only the basic modifier is available. We have planned to develop two other weapon modifiers (\"Spread\" and \"Mirroring\") but have not yet been completed in this version.</p>\r\nPiercing Bullet\r\n<p>The piercing bullet is a special bullet available in<strong> later parts</strong> of the game. This skill is a very powerful weapon which delivers <strong>huge </strong>amount of damage to enemies. The speciality of this bullet is that it <strong>may go through</strong> covid enemies and will only be destroyed when hitting walls or platforms. Hence the name \"Piercing\".\u00a0 The piercing bullet is also called the <strong>\"Silver Bullet\"</strong> since it is powerful enough to destroy <strong>silver boxes</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Due to its powerful capabilities, this bullet can only be used <strong>one</strong> at a time and has a <strong>cooldown </strong>of <strong>15 seconds</strong>. You may toggle wether to use this bullet or not which can be seen\u00a0in the player HUD. To toggle on and off\u00a0press <strong>4</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: In v1.0 the piercing bullet is made available from the start to test this feature against enemies as well as some puzzles involving the silver bullet.<br/></p>\r\nMask\r\n<p>The mask is a mechanic that Putih can use when available. When activated, the mask will provide\u00a0 a temporary shield for <strong>10 seconds</strong> which can be used in crucial situations. However, the mask skill has\u00a0 a <strong>cooldown </strong>of <strong>30 seconds</strong>. To use the mask press <strong>F</strong> when available. The mask is a skill available from the start.</p>\n\n\r\nCovid Colony\r\n<p>There are various members of covid colony and they come in all shapes and sizes. Starting from the soldiers which can be seen commonly throughout the game and the more deadly\u00a0generals in the covid army. Each type of enemy has their own skills and abilities so watch out for them!</p>\r\nSoldiers\r\n<p>Every soldier in the covid colony will do anything they can to stop Putih from cleansing areas of the blood colony. They are ordered to shoot Putih <strong>on sight</strong>. However, they will <strong>not chase</strong> you and will only <strong>patrol</strong> their areas. Thus, if you are able to <strong>hide from their line of sight</strong> by using the environment (walls, platforms, etc.) they will <strong>not shoot</strong> at you and will only <strong>continue patroling</strong>. There are several type of soldiers in the covid colony army.</p>\r\nCovid Soldier\r\n<p>Covid Soldier is the <strong>basic enemy</strong> you can find in the game. They are\u00a0the easiest members to defeat from\u00a0the covid colony\u00a0. The Covid Soldier\u00a0also has <strong>low </strong><strong>HP</strong> and can deal <strong>low damage</strong>. However, the soldiers often show up in groups so be careful not to be\u00a0surrounded by them.</p>\n\r\nSergeant Covid\r\n<p>Sergeant Covid is the second type of\u00a0enemy in the game. This enemy is harder to kill than Covid Soldiers primarily because it <strong>has a shield</strong>. The sergeant\u00a0has the <strong>same abilities</strong> as the Covid Soldiers. The main difference between them lies in the <strong>ammount of\u00a0HP</strong> that Sergeant Covid has because of the shield. To defeat the Sergeant you must <strong>destroy the shield first</strong>, which will take more time compared to Covid Soldiers.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: In v1.0 there are only two types of soldiers available. We planned to have two other variants of soldiers to develop.<br/></p>\r\nGenerals (Bosses)\r\n<p>Generals are the leaders a.k.a. bosses\u00a0of the covid colony army. They <strong>lurk and control certain areas</strong>. To reach them, first you must <strong>cleanse your way through soldiers\u00a0</strong>of the covid colony present in the area. Each general has <strong>unique set of skills and attack patterns</strong> that you must take note of. Be very careful since\u00a0during battle these generals\u00a0may<strong> use a different attack </strong>pattern once their <strong>HP has reached a certain threshold</strong>.</p>\r\nCaptain Flu\r\n<p>Captain Flu is the <strong>first General</strong> that you will encounter at the<strong> end of\u00a0Chapter 2</strong>. Unlike the enemies stated above, Captain Flu has <strong>a lot more HP</strong> and <strong>various mechanics</strong> to attack Putih. Be sure to watch out every type of its attack patterns!\u00a0If you\u00a0are able to defeat Captain Flu, you will be rewarded with a new weapon modifier which is the\u00a0<strong>\"Spread\" modifier</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: In v1.0 only one boss is available which is Captain Flu. The weapon modifier \"Spread\" will also not yet be rewarded as Chapter 3 is not yet available.</p>\n\r\nWorld Mechanics\r\nCheckpoint\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Covid Colony has\u00a0 checkpoints <strong>spread throughout every single chapter</strong>. Putih will be able to <strong>respawn</strong> to the <strong>last </strong>checkpoint that you've <strong>passed through</strong> when you die either by falling or losing all your HP. Passed checkpoints are marked by the <strong>flag </strong>(right picture), while checkpoints that have not yet been passed can only be seen by the <strong>flag pole\u00a0</strong>(left picture). Pass through the flag pole to trigger the checkpoint.</p>\r\nEncounters\r\n\n<p>An encounter is when you have <strong>triggered enemies</strong> of the covid colony to spawn by enetering their area. During an encounter, you will be <strong>locked</strong> in certain areas with several enemies at once and you will <strong>not be able to escape</strong>. The only way to get out is by <strong>defeating all enemies</strong> in the area. When you have died in an area, you will be <strong>respawned to the last checkpoint</strong> you passed through.</p>\r\nBoxes and Silver Boxes\r\n\n<p>Boxes are objects that are <strong>blocking</strong> your way to go further. Boxes can be destroyed with <strong>any types of projectile</strong> once their HP bar is empty.\u00a0Silver Boxes are boxes that can <strong>only</strong> be destroyed by using <strong>Silver Bullets</strong> (i.e. Piercing Bullet). Destroy every box you can find as it <strong>may lead to new unexplored areas</strong>.\u00a0BOOM!</p>\r\nArtefacts\r\n\n<p>Artefacts are interactable objects that can give Putih a <strong>permanent power up</strong> in the form of <strong>increased maximum HP or cirtical chance</strong> (cannot be chosen, fixed by the system). To interact with an artifact press <strong>E</strong>. When interacted, you must correctly <strong>answer a quiz</strong> to gain the power up (<strong>still in Bahasa Indonesia</strong>). Answering <strong>incorectly </strong>will result in <strong>an encounter</strong> with enemies from the Covid Colony. On the other hand, anwering <strong>correctly </strong>will give you<strong> full health restoration</strong> and<strong> gain the permanent power up</strong>.</p>\n<p>Artefacts are <strong>optional </strong>objectives that you may choose to obtain or not. Power ups you gained from artefacts will be <strong>permanent across all levels</strong> after you <strong>sucessfully finish the current level</strong>. If you obtain the power up but did not finish the chapter, you power up will not be kept and you must the quiz and the chapter again. Once obtained and successfully finishing the chapter, you will not be able to obtain the same artefact again in another playthrough of the same chapter.</p>\n\r\nOther Game Features\r\nChapters (Levels)\r\n<p>There are <strong>five planned chapters</strong> in Covid Colony. Entering each chapter will <strong>reset</strong> the HP and life bar. Only <strong>gathered skills</strong> will be available when entering any level. You can select previous levels that you have previously completed in order to explore more of the previous area to <strong>achieve 100% completion</strong>. Generally, the camera will <strong>follow Putih</strong> when exploring each area <strong>except during encounters</strong>. Each chapter also has a certain body part that it resembles. Here are details on each chapter:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Chapter 1: White Blood Academy</strong></li></ul>\n<p>The first chapter is basically a <strong>tutorial phase</strong> where you will be guided on the mechanics available in the game (<strong>still in Bahasa Indonesia</strong> however). By completing the tutorial phase, Putih have successfully become a White Blood soldier capable of dealing with deadly viruses. The White Blood Academy is located in the <strong>spinal cord and bone marrows</strong>\u00a0of the body.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Chapter 2: The Covid Attacks!</strong></li></ul>\n<p>The second chapter is a level located in the <strong>mouth and nasal cavity</strong>. Here you can begin to\u00a0freely explore the are\u00a0and try to find a way to\u00a0reach Captain Flu. There are various interactions spread throughout the level.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: In v1.0 only Chapters 1 and 2 are fully developed. The other three chapters will be released in later versions of the game.<br/></p>\r\nSave\r\n\r\n<p>There are <strong>no manual saves</strong> in Covid Colony. Auto saving will <strong>automatically </strong>be done <strong>after you finished any chapter</strong> or when you have <strong>exited the game</strong> after finishing a chapter. Your progress inside a chapter <strong>will not be saved</strong> <strong>if you leave the chapte</strong>r (i.e. you must restart at the beginning of the level when you leave the level).</p>\n\r\nVersion Notes (v1.0)\r\n<ul><li>Piercing Bullet can be used from the start (not as originally planned as explained above)</li><li>The\u00a0<strong>encyclopedia</strong>\u00a0menu is available from the pause menu but cannot be seen yet.<br/>\n</li><li>Some soldier enemy types\u00a0that have been planned (not mentioned above):\u00a0<ul><li><strong>\"Covid Bomber\"</strong> (Flying enemies)\u00a0</li><li><strong>\"Twin Covids\"</strong> (Twin tower connected enemies).</li></ul></li><li>Some generals that have been planned (not mentioned above):\u00a0<ul><li>\"<strong>Colonel Pneumonia</strong>\" (Chapter 3 Boss)</li><li>\"<strong>General Dengue</strong>\" (Chapter 4 Boss)</li><li>\"<strong>King Corona</strong>\" (Final Boss)</li></ul></li><li>Some skills that have been planned (not mentioned above):<ul><li><strong>\"Spread\" modifier</strong> (Modifier that can shoot three bullets at once)</li><li><strong>\"Mirroring\" modifier</strong> (Modifier that can shoot two bullets in different directions at once)</li></ul></li><li>Some features that have been planned\u00a0(not mentioned above):<ul><li><strong>Gates and Gate Button</strong> (For Puzzles)</li><li><strong>Encyclopedia\u00a0</strong>(Progress record of each chapter, enemy details, skill details, etc.)</li><li><strong>Collectibles</strong> (Inside chapters to collect and gain extra lives)</li><li><strong>Achievements</strong> (Overall progress and some specified to each chapter or enemy)</li><li><strong>New Game+ </strong>(To replay levels with all skills obtained in order to gather achievements or collectibles).</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:41:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf855ca8fc7ada6c361b05b784a7be7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jaden0904"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
