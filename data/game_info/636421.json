Both have same awesome music but different gfx.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Pong4K 2019. Code/SFX by Cobe, Pixel Art by Koyot1222, Testing/Support by</p>\n<p>Lemming880.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>4 players can play sharing 2 CD32 joy pads. One player plays on d-pad and the</p>\n<p>other one uses red/blue/green/yellow buttons the same as if they were d-pad:</p>\n<p>red=left, yellow=right, blue=down, green=up. The player jumps by pressing the</p>\n<p>direction button (up/down/left/right) depending on the side that it is facing.</p>\n<p>During the game:</p>\n<p>Play button - pause</p>\n<p>Backward/Esc - back to Title Screen</p>\n<p>If you don't like to share or you don't have two CD32 joy pads but you have a</p>\n<p>keyboard, 3rd and 4th player can useWASD+LAlt (jump) and Arrows+RAlt (jump)</p>\n<p>keys.</p>\n<p>On the Title Screen you can start one of the three game modes by moving the</p>\n<p>joystick in port 2 up or down and pressing fire. You can also enter the options</p>\n<p>menu. In options menu use left/right to change:</p>\n<p>-game difficulty</p>\n<p>-match duration</p>\n<p>-number of joysticks/joy pads used</p>\n<p>When you start the game all the players are controlled by CPU. You join the game</p>\n<p>by pressing the jump button (direction button).</p>\n<p>Game modes:</p>\n<p>2x2 - two players are positioned at the top and two at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>They play in co-op mode and their points areadded up. At the start only two</p>\n<p>players are initialized. The other two players will appear if they press jump to</p>\n<p>join. The Sauceris revolving in random directions around the center of the</p>\n<p>screen and can also bounce the ball. It slowly approaches the centerof the</p>\n<p>screen and when it reaches the center gravity will kick in.</p>\n<p>IIxII - two players are positioned at the left and two at the right part of the</p>\n<p>screen. At each side there is a goal. One player ispositioned near the goal and</p>\n<p>plays as goal-keeper while the other one is positioned closer to the center and</p>\n<p>plays as an attacker.</p>\n<p>4x4 - each player is positioned at his own side of the screen. +1 point goes to</p>\n<p>the player that was last to hit the ball before itwent out of the screen. -1</p>\n<p>point goes to the player on of the side of the screen where the ball went out.</p>\n<p>Points don't go below zero.</p>\n<p>Power ups are activated by breaking the boxes that appear on the screen. All the</p>\n<p>boxes take two hits to be broken except theblack one which needs only one hit.</p>\n<p>-Green box - slows down all players for 5 seconds except the one who broke it.</p>\n<p>-Blue box - freezes all players for 3 seconds except the one who broke it.</p>\n<p>-Purple box - fades screen to black and back.</p>\n<p>-Black box - does nothing.</p>\n<p>Tip: If you are moving or jumping, part of your acceleration will be passed to</p>\n<p>the ball thus the angle of the bounced ball will be changed.</p>\n<p>If you're playing from emulator, 100% stereo separation is recommended.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T09:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298bdf33fe6a839145a738a1d25474c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amiga Cobe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
