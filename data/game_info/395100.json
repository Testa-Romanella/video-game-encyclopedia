Take control of the beloved kitten chef to make some of her most famous recipes as seen on her show.</p>\n\n<p>Cooking with Cat is a single player\u00a0game focused on\u00a0the simplicity of a cat's life...\u00a0 so that means knocking things over! Fill out Chef Mina's ingredient sheet, or put in some <em>yucky</em> ingredients, or simply push them all on to the floor as any esteemed cat chef would.</p>\n\r\nYour very own Cooking Show!\r\n<p>Your kitten-hood dream has finally come true! After years of blood, sweat, and tears at the elite\u00a0<em>Le Cat-don Mew </em>school in Paris,\u00a0 you're now a world-renowned chef. Every Sunday morning, millions of adoring fans tune their TVs to channel 629 for your morning cooking show, Cooking with Cat. Hundreds of fans line up outside for a chance to come and watch the magic happen live, since admission is based on who brings the chef the tastiest fish breakfast of course.</p>\r\nNo Pressure Gameplay!\r\n<p>There are no timers, no ranking systems, or angry owners scolding you for just doing your due diligence as a cat. Take things at your own pace! Chef Mina's final creations vary based on the number of ingredients that end up in the bowl (and even more varied creations for when a yucky ingredient goes in). Take as much time as you need to ensure perfection in the kitchen! However, if you make something nasty there's no guarantee Chef Mina will enjoy it... but she'll probably gobble it up anyway.</p>\r\nUnique and Adorable Art!\r\n<p>Chef Mina's design was made based off of the artist's real-life cat, who shares a similar love of pushing things from high places. The 2D art style was chosen to reflect the playfulness of being a cat and tossing things around, while also being pleasant to look at. The items in 3D were downloaded for free from the Unity Asset Store (so don't try to commission us for 3D modelling work!)</p><ul><li><em>Programming/Design: Max</em></li><li><em>Art/Programming: Anna</em></li><li><em>Design: Kate</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T04:44:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f0/6f007ba2b05afbc54e21421e6b2cf912.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kate", "Anna", "xasm", "CookingWithCat"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
