FootLOL lets you use mines, shields, aliens, cows, guns and many more cheats to decimate the opposing team and protect your players. Play against your friends or AI opponents.<br/><br/>As a manager, you\u2019ll take your team through a few training matches, before being unleashed on new planets. As you go, you\u2019ll unlock new gadgets, improve your players\u2019 performance, and unlock new kits and hats for them to wear.<br/><br/>Opponents often have the same tricks you do so it\u2019s not as simple as knocking the ball in the back of the net.  You\u2019ll need to fulfil the conditions for each level \u2013 which might mean losing, or fighting your way back from defeat! Thankfully, the addictive action, cute characters and the best arsenal seen in a football game since, well, Arsenal make every match too close to call.<br/><br/>Once you\u2019ve finished FootLOL\u2019s tournament mode, you can play against the computer or go online for gripping multiplayer.
