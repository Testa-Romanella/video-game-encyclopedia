Go far distances, and go fast while doing it. Jump over trash, beach balls, and gaps in the road. Grind some rails, and just look cool.<br/><br/>You've got some gnarly tricks too! Drop down immediately in air to get right back to the ground. Kickflip midair to double jump. Don't get wrecked!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T03:18:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da5bd436a0fe1d80549c59106f7e3311.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jasoonmargoon", "Gnarvana Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Gnarvana Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
