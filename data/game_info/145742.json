It's inspired by the end of Wall-E in that sense.</p><p>The goal is to wander the area and grow plants in order to restore life to the various regions. Currently, aside from a tutorial region, there are 4 small regions to test out the various mechanics of the game. The player has the ability to create wind tunnels, and can splash out water in order to fully grow plants.</p>Credits:Programmers:<ul><li>Arsany Azmy</li><li>Connor McGwire</li><li>Michael Ritchie</li><li>Spencer Milner</li></ul>Art:<ul><li>Connor McGwire</li></ul>Music:<ul><li>Colin McGwire</li></ul>Sound Effects from FreeSound.org:<ul><li>Digging sound (earth platform) - prozaciswack</li><li>Planting sound - Hodomostvarujemritam</li><li>Wind sound - jimmygu3</li><li>Splash sound - angeliqueperdikes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/225/2250e6f9226d0b9f26c037a9bf46c359.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TeamD4D"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
