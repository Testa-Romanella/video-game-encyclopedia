Grab your baseball cap and loosen your pants, it's time to fight endless hordes of enemies and collect every weapon crate you can. Prepare for an arcade delight with tight controls, refreshing game mechanics, cracking retro art and a terribly hip chiptune soundtrack.<br/><br/>\"Supremely straightforward, criminally addictive, and easily the best retro action title I\u2019ve ever played on iOS.\" - AppAdvice<br/><br/>You're put into a combat arena with only a basic weapon and a clear goal: collect as many crates as you possibly can. The enemies will start coming soon, and they won't ever stop. A steady supply of new weapons will be provided by the crates, but you can only hold one weapon at a time. Will the next weapon you find be better than the one you have, or worse? You may want to ride it out a little longer with a weapon you like, but your score won't move if you don't grab those crates. Super Crate Box seems like a straightforward action game, but having to adapt to your ever-changing offensive abilities means no two rounds are ever quite the same.<br/><br/>As you collect more crates round after round, you'll unlock new weapons that will have a chance of appearing from then on. Do particularly well in a single round, and you might unlock a new character, arena, or gameplay mode. Each new thing you uncover adds another layer to the game, creating fresh challenges and situations. The enemies continue to get stronger and faster the longer you play, so even the best player will eventually meet their end. How many crates can you claim before then?<br/><br/>- Endless Action: You'll never run out of enemies to blast!<br/>- Crates Are Great: Grab a crate to get a different weapon and wreak havoc in new ways!<br/>- Unlock Cool New Stuff: New weapons! New characters! New stages!<br/>- Wacky Weapons: More than a dozen different ways of dealing destruction including rocket launchers, katanas, land mines, and more!<br/>- Ambush Mode: Normal Mode not random enough for you? How about randomly appearing enemies?<br/><br/>Super Crate Box is one of the many fantastic games brought back to life by GameClub, fully updated to support the latest versions of iOS and newest devices.<br/><br/>**************************************************<br/><br/>Super Crate Box is playable for free, with some sections and features available only to subscribers of GameClub Pro, an optional auto-renewing monthly subscription which also removes ads.
