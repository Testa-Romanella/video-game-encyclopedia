Players change the 3 values with the 2 switches and the triggers on the vive controllers. This outputs a fail%, which deforms the balls coming out of the factory. The Perfection value is the \"nonmarkovian value\" that represents how much data we have gathered from the black box. The Shift lasts about 3minutes 25seconds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ea/9ea29dd97fc3d3fe67ec600d32dc73f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steelfraud"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
