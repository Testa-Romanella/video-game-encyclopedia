In it, you take the role of a hunter-gatherer who is constantly moving and exploring new procedurally generated and tile-based levels to gain resources. If you don't collect enough (50) food per level, you will lose. You can also collect other resources such as ore and logs that you can sell in the shop in\u00a0order to buy more either more food or powerful and probably unbalanced\u00a0upgrades. The shop will have a small chance to\u00a0 appear after you finish a level.\u00a0There is also a blizzard on your tail, meaning you only have a limited amount of time in each level, so you have to take quick and strategical decisions about which resources to collect and prioritize, ensuring you get as many resources as possible without losing. The snow and music will warn you when the blizzard is getting too close (along with a handy timer).</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Click to collect an adjacent resource</p>\n<p>Press Space (while standing in the exit tile)\u00a0to move on the next level</p>\n<p>Press Escape to pause the game</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>WILDCARDS</p>\n<p>Better, faster, stronger: The shop features upgrades.</p>\n<p>Educational: See educational information in the pause screen.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>BUGS</p>\n<p>If you click on a tile at the uppermost row, then it will not register the same as the other tiles.
