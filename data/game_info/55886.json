Cars continuously drive forward through rectangular channels in a simple maze. At the four cardinal directions are gaps where a car can change lanes. The goal is to collect dots in the maze while avoiding collisions with the computer-controlled car that is also collecting dots. It's the first maze game where the goal is to run over dots, and Head On is considered a precursor to Namco's 1980 hit Pac-Man.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1979-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-24T10:57:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b8/9b891bd24b181444e0838314170312e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Game Boy"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Gremlin"], "esrb_rating": null}
