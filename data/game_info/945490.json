I wanted to make a hockey game, and also something simple and arcadey. I may come back and finish this up at some point but it was largely a learning project, so who knows. Total run time... idunno.... 10 minutes??<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a post apocalyptic hellscape, the world driven to a nuclear winter following the end of the 2069 war between the mightiest world powers- The Confederate States of Canada and The Scandinavian Megagovernment. In this violent, frozen world one sport reigns supreme- blood hockey. Unfortunately for you, the Maw Riders, a group of raiders who settled on the radioactive crater of the first bomb, have made you their prisoner and plaything. They will throw irradiated horrors and their own men in the rink they\u2019ve locked you in, but you don\u2019t give up that easily. They want a show? You\u2019ll give \u2018em a show.</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate any feedback, tips, or tricks to improve this game or future projects!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T08:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a0/7a0f520f0a948b82091ac1fc9e4cfd50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anticharmquark"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
