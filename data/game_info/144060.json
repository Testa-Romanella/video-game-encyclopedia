The inspiration for this was a much smaller tale: \"For sale: baby shoes, never worn.\" We wanted to try something similar; a game that told a story through implication and imagery, instead of exposition. Theories are welcome in the comments!\u00a0<br/><br/>This was done for the 72-hour Jam, but we decided to impose the same rules as the Compo (blew the 48-hour deadline, though we lost most of a day due to tech difficulties and prior engagements). The engine was coded entirely during the competition, using Java, LWJGL, and Slick-Util. None of the visual or audio assets were made prior to the Jam either.\u00a0<br/><br/>Considering that this was our first Ludum Dare, we're pretty happy with how the game came out. Here's hoping you enjoy it too, it was a blast to make!\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Buttons -\u00a0<strong>Mouse</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Left Click</strong></li><li>Move - <strong>Arrows</strong></li><li>Attack - <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong></li><li>Jump - <strong>S</strong></li></ul>Credits\u00a0\r\n<ul><li><strong>HitchH1k3r</strong>\u00a0(@HitchH1k3r,\u00a0hitchh1k3rsguide.com)</li><li><strong>Naali</strong>\u00a0(@AlopexL)</li><li><strong>Day</strong>\u00a0(Solifuge,\u00a0@Dahold)</li></ul>Special Thanks\r\n<ul><li>The small but dedicated Twitch TV audience who kept us company while we worked.</li><li>A Legit Viking who shall remain nameless, but offered much Historical and Mythological Consultation, and provided vital Scandinavian Fact-Checking Services.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/757/757dbd76096426c7314912e247d5df69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunspider", "HitchH1k3r"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
