Getting the collisions to work satisfactorily was a bit of a pain but I've also managed to make the ball speed increase in relation to paddle speed on contact. I've also added a feature to change the score needed to win.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T08:19:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/475/4754cde43e98aaac16b0472cc9faed03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Drahcir Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
