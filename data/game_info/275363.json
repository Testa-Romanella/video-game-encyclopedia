It was developed very much as a learning project, to help our newly created game studio develop a functioning workflow, and as such it has a rather limited scope.<br/></p>\n<p>Since it's a learning project, it is completely free to play, although donations are welcome! Also, we would of course love to hear your thoughts about the game. Any feedback will be useful to us as we tackle future, larger projects. <br/><strong>Styrbj\u00f6rn Andersson,<br/>PastPixel developer</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Programming, art, audio and music</strong><br/>Styrbj\u00f6rn Andersson</p>\n<p><strong>Play Testing<br/></strong>Erik Andersson<br/>Elias Andersson<br/>Veronica Andersson<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bcb467fcc7d525fabd27b51f752a1b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["styrbjorn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
