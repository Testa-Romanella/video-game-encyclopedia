Inspired by the manga, Three Days of Happiness by Miaki Sugaru, this was\u00a0written for my final assignment in my Writing for Games I class. The constraint was\u00a0the\u00a0Telltale Games test:\u00a0writers had to create a story involving a visit to a bank, include at least 5 interactive choices, and take no more than approx.\u00a07 mins to complete a playthrough of a path.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's not as poignant as I\u00a0hoped, but it's a small story with a lesson about hope. There are two endings to obtain depending on your choices. It has been roughly proofread and playtested, though occasional typos may be present.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was previously titled Life's Worth. I\u00a0debated on a number of titles but decided to settle with a twist on the phrase terms of service; another title I considered was the phrase cost of living.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dev time:\u00a0approximately 15 hours\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T17:01:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1e74a0580231e716d20c0573face84d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lexi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
