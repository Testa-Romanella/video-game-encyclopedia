I will... make it move! And it will keep moving until it hits a wall, like those mini-games some games have. But here's the twist, it'll... hmm.....\u00a0<em>what if it were a shooter..?</em></p>\n<p>And then, a month and a half later, <em>Moving Box Shooter</em> was complete.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game is my first attempt at creating and releasing a fully realized game. Every single aspect of the game was done by me, including the original soundtrack, the sound effects,\u00a0and the artworks. The only things I didn't create myself were the tools I used, and a few public domain audio samples.</p>\n<p>It was challenging, to say the least. And the game is a mess under the hood. You don't want to know the atrocities I\u00a0had to commit to make that UI.\u00a0<strong>Trust me.</strong></p>\n<p>But hey, it works! There's definitely going to be small bugs and crashes here and there, but the game should generally run smoothly. Hopefully. There are a few (mostly graphical) things I might fix/add later in a patch. But for now, it is what it is.</p>\n\n<p>The game should run on Windows, and\u00a0<em>might</em>\u00a0run on Linux. Unfortunately, I can't export to Mac due to some proprietary notarization nonsense.</p>\n\n<p>TOOLS USED (that I can think of off the top of my head):</p>\n\n<p>Godot 3.4.2</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The game engine.</p>\n\n<p>Furnace Tracker 0.6 pre3</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A multi-system second generation tracker made by tildearrow. In other words, it's a tool for making chiptune, but on steroids. Soundtrack made with the YM2612, Game Boy, and a Generic PCM. Sound effects made with a tildearrow Sound Unit. You might not know what that means, but you'll hear it either way.</p>\n\n<p>Inkscape 1.1</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Vector graphics tool.</p>\n\n<p>Audacity 2.4.2</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Used briefly for the tutorial dialogues, and for converting the music from .wav to .ogg</p>\n\n<p>VCV Rack</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Used in the soundtrack\u00a0to make a sample for\u00a0<strong>Dark</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>GIMP</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Used to export the icon.</p>\n\n<p>rcedit</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 An... extension..?\u00a0 \u00a0for Godot that is required for setting meta-data.
