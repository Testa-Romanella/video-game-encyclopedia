The game is engaging for all, yet for survivors and children who are currently battling cancer, the game is empowering. The developer has truly set out to make a game that kids can play while receiving cancer treatments; something to distract them, but at the same time, put them back in control of their battle. In addition to this being a great game, the developer is donating all their proceeds from the game to Game Changer Charity, a wonderful non-profit organization whose mission is to spread hope and love to children staying in hospitals.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen we think of video games, our minds go to epic battles, fantasy worlds, crazy races and mind-boggling adventures. For Kenny Roy, creating a game is about hitting the perfect balance between pure amusement and lifting spirits.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22f/22ff4b06d63c5c7a3e90d1c33ae349a9.jpg", "website": "http://doubleplusgoodgames.com/portfolio/i-hope/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 23, "owned": 35, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Kenny Roy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["++Good Games", "GameChanger Charity"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
