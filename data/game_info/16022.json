She has no memories at all, not even knowing her own name.<br />\nTo make matters worse, the first person she meets is out to kill her.<br />\nOur heroine runs for her life through the unknown streets, only to run headfirst into another stranger. Fortunately for her, this man is the don of the mafia famiglia Oz. With no love for would-be murderers of innocent women, he drives off her attacker and takes her underneath his famiglia\u2019s wing.<br />\nThis is hardly the end of her troubles, however. Famiglia Oz is but one of many different mafia famiglie in town, and bitter conflicts for territory rage eternally between them all. Only on Sundays does peace return to the town by a mutual compromise, and come the next day the battles continue anew as if they had never ceased.<br />\nIt is in this war-torn town that our rootless heroine must find her way. Who amongst the mafias simply seeks to use her for their own ends, and who can she truly come to trust... and even love?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-17T23:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49f/49fe2687864cf67b5ecbb62e9ec76fdb.jpg", "website": "http://mangagamer.org/ozmafia", "rating": 3.78, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 15, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 449, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PS Vita"], "developers": ["Poni-Pachet SY"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["MangaGamer"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
