I plan on releasing another RPG similar to it, but it's still in its draft stage.</ul><ul>I had to take a sudden hiatus due to a multitude of stuff going down in my personal life. Without revealing too much, I was not in the mental or physical space to work on or finish any games I started.</ul><ul><p>Around December I finally felt a little more secure in my living situation to fix up this game. It's been a bit of a hassle to find a balance between working on this while being a full-time student, but I'm happy to finally have this version of the prologue out.</p><p>I'm hoping this year, life won't throw anymore curveballs at me so I can actually finish my projects.</p></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T10:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/389/3893080dfafc4eff8aaeabd513416ff6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["saltie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
