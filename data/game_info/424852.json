Download for a faster experience.<br/></p>\n<p>You are a STARSHIP CAPTAIN, flying your incredible STARSHIP through a DANGEROUS ASTEROID FIELD. You must AVOID these ASTEROIDS as quickly as you can, whilst ACQUIRING the valuable SPACE COINS you come across.</p>\n<p>Asteroid Avoider is a short minigame I made in DragonRuby. I made this game a while back and meant to turn it into more, but haven't had the inspiration to continue it. I might turn it into a more complete game in the future. For now though, it's playable as a mini-game! Try and get as many coins as you can, and good luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a40e33f5d32914023c1f10ceed5b1d9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Doctor Joshua"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
