The task itself is made that much more difficult due to the fact that he is not allowed the use of any weapons. His code of conduct prevents him from purchasing any firearms, such as: 9mm pistols, AK-47 rifles, double-barreled shotguns, long-scoped sniper rifles etc. His code also prevents him from using any blunt instruments, including his staff. That being said, he does have the power of space-time continuum at his fingertips, including the ability to both rewind and completely freeze time around him, which is a considerable advantage.</p>\n<p>Buttons:</p>\n<p>Movement - WASD<br/>Jump - Space<br/>Restart - R<br/>Interact with Object - Left Click<br/>Freeze Single Enemy(not available from the start) - Right Click<br/>Interact with door - E<br/>Rewind Time - Q<br/>Freeze Time - F</p>\n<p>Details - This is a game made for the 4th Brackeys Game Jam, theme being \"Rewind\". <br/>Total Dev Time - 1 Week</p>\n<p>Font Used - m5x7 by Daniel Linssen</p>\n<p>Sound samples: - soundbible.com<br/>- freesound.org</p>\n<p>Edit:</p>\n<p>There is an issue when pressing the left alt key.
