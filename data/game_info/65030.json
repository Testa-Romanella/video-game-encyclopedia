We currently support both mouse-keyboard and gamepad-controller setups. The game will feature collectible upgrades for weapons and armor that are located throughout the world of Zarda. They will enhance the characters abilities and enable them to access areas in previous levels that they could not and unlock new abilities.\u200b<br/><br/><br/>The final game will present non-linear level progression. After completing some of the starting stages the player will have the freedom of choice to choose where you want to go similar to the overworld style in games like Shovel knight.<br/><br/>Each character has a unique set of abilities that differentiate their playstyle from each other. Saya the Fox is a very melee and speed oriented chatacter, whereas Sil the Squirrel is more focused on range combat and heavy weapons.<br/><br/><br/>Our game presents a unique artstyle apart from other indie games that are released. While most focus on pixel art of the 8bit or 16 bit era we've decided to apprach this from a different angle. Our artist was inspired from the artstyle from \"My Life as a Teenage Robot\" and infused the artwork with much of its inspration.<br/><br/><br/>We certainly want N.U.T.Z. to be the best game and we have ideas that would enhance it beyond the base game we've presented so far. <br/><br/>Some stretch goals and plans include:<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>New game +, where a new challenge awaits you<br/></li><li>Boss Rush mode<br/></li><li>In game vehicles to take control of.<br/></li><li>Fully voiced characters and dialogue.<br/></li><li>Co-op and verses multiplayer (local and internet)<br/></li><li>Ports to consoles like the Nintendo Switch<br/></li><li>Localizations to different languages</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>[h1]The Story:[/h1]<br/><br/>There exists a peaceful world in a far away galaxy. The Planet \u201cZarda\u201d<br/>is a utopia, where all live in harmony and balance with themselves and<br/>the planet. Centuries of peace among its nations have lead to<br/>disarmament and have long done away with improving or maintaining their military power. However, this would have repercussions as the world comes under attack by an alien menace. The sudden invasion of the nomadic reptilian invaders known as the Saurian Empire catches the defense force of the planet off guard. They aren't prepared to fight a proper military force that has been fighting for centuries, one that<br/>consumes the resources and living beings of any planet unfortunate<br/>enough to stand in its way.<br/><br/>Sil and Saya, our game's protagonists come under attack at an outpost. With their comrades dead and the defense forces in disarray they takethe fight to the enemy themselves. Along the way they'll meet newfriends and enemies, and discover the ancient secrets of the world while they battle for survival of the fittest.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/943/94313da438815069de8e9c49cf003c10.jpg", "website": "http://www.nutzgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 456, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pandemonium Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pandemonium Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
