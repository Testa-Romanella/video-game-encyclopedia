The fortress works as an ancient nexus for different planes of existence. The depths are in an eternal turmoil as both old and new gods struggle for power, it\u2019s up to the players to choose their position and stance in all of this.<br />\nThe game is a hybrid of survival horror and dungeon crawler genres with its influences ranging from Silent Hill to Nethack.

You can target individual limbs of your enemies to dismember them strategically and thus maximize your chances for survival. However, just the same, enemies can also cut off the arms and the legs of your playable characters if you are not careful. You need to prepare well for every encounter if you wish to stay alive. But don\u2019t forget that running away from threats is often the best solution as well. There are many ways for survival in Fear &amp; Hunger - You can find better equipment, learn different blood and love magic, fuse characters into each other, pray different gods, talk your way out of battles, meet new party members, snipe enemies from distance, use traps to disable them\u2026 and so on. The Idea is to use what you got at your disposal and be creative with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-23T11:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40ffb9b3224a89f17cb398b79468a9d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.06, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 22, "owned": 141, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 15, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 34, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 35, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Miro Haverinen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Happy Paintings"], "esrb_rating": null}
