Meet the witnesses, hunt for clues, and gather alibis in a world where no-one will help you with anything until you solve a puzzle for them first!<br/><br/>With a run-time of a few hours, Victoria Clair and the Mystery Express is perfect for a weekend of puzzle-solving play! Tell a friend. Grab your cat. Maybe your cat will help you with the puzzles? I don't know. I had enough trouble getting my own cat to voice-act for this thing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T02:27:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/295/2958883d3307c86bc987b071bb252664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Kiang"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Michael Kiang"], "esrb_rating": null}
