Maybe for some that isolation is key. Not for me. This year I formed a partnership with Edgar Castro Design, to begin work on two projects. We click well, and make a good team - enhancing each others abilities. Also company is good, and I want to have fun making stuff. </p><p>This week we decided to take a break from our current projects and dive into something new and separate from what we've been doing. We decided to have a 4 hour game-jam. I had already began working of a fishing game for class, we decided it would serve as our jumping off point. </p><p>Edgar is much more experienced programmer, so it was great to have additional guidance and explanation as to what's what.</p><p>I had gone to a party the night before, where I found myself drinking alcohol, not for the fun of it but as a necessary substance in dealing with some truly vapid conversations. I then quickly checked myself and realized, no, I'm just being a pretentious ass. People are allowed to find comforts in social norms and college party stories. People need those things too. </p><p>I'm drunk, I voice note Edgar saying I had an idea for the game jam. How we can transform the fishing game. To play it from the perspective of what a pretentious ass would see or read into when engaging in regular social interactions.</p><p>A game where a player is within a conversation, fishing for compliments - or for specific sentences that allows them further their own personal agenda of self-validation. </p><p>Now this was a 4 hour game jam - so it's not completely perfect or polished but the basic idea is there. There's a lot more work to be done and Edgar and I have already decided to make it more gamey and fleshed out, as a fun think to interact with on both of our sites.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b34/b348b6edcb862e1c572be0cb4e7a1b46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rohil"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
