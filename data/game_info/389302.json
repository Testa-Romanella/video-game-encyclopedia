We've decided to make a game where you control a local pearl goddess\u00a0who is cleaning the ocean and restoring life.\u00a0</p><p>The pearls are known to be made out of pollution inside a pearl clam, that is why we decided to make it our main character.\u00a0<br/>The game has two ending, either the player wins, beats the timer and pollution or they lose and never make it in time.\u00a0<br/>Both ways the pearl will break, because it's impossible to save everything\u00a0at this point in ocean pollution so either way the pearl is too polluted to carry on, even if the player wins.\u00a0<br/>The goal is to heal all the creatures and seaweed and replenish all the oily blobs that are making the sea life\u00a0infected.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:04:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d564cfd8905265f52ac37324806b4f1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BelugaWhales"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
