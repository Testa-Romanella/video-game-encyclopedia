I thought I could develop it and study for school at the same time and get the full game out by Halloween. However, between midterms and various assignments, I couldn't get much more done than learning to 3D model and animate a lighter in blender. So, over the weekend of Halloween 2020, I decided I couldn't finish the whole thing for Halloween, but I still wanted to put something out. So, here's a prototype.</p><p>Sorry about the crappy screenshots. It's literally the night of Halloween, I just spent several hours of both today and yesterday rushing on the game to finish it, and I don't really have the time to go through and take stunning screenshots of every feature I've implemented so far. <br/></p><p>You're stuck in an infinite maze with enemies that chase you and will kill you if they touch you. Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around. Switch between your lighter and your rifle using the 1 and 2 keys. Hit space to jump. Left click to fire your gun if you have it equipped. Some parts of the maze are lit, and others have an enemy waiting to ambush you. Carefully navigate around. If you find a small pyramid on the ground, that's currently the portal to the next part of the maze. Touch it and wait in order to proceed to the next part of the maze. Currently there is no scoring system of any kind.\u00a0</p><p>If a monster kills you, hit the R key to restart.</p><p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T04:37:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/929/9294a1c0c769fa02376c5834205ee1b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["blehmeh98"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
