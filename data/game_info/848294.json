You will have to start from the beginning.</p>\r\nMissiles\r\n<p>You start with 1 missile, but you can hold up to 3 (indicated in the top right).</p>\n<p>Pressing X fires a missile. Missiles explode damaging all enemies caught in the blast.</p>\r\nPower\r\n<p>You start with 0 power with a max of 9 (indicated in the top left).</p>\n<p>Collecting a Power Pip increases your power by 1. Getting hit costs 3 power.</p>\n<p>Enemies will sometimes drop a Power Pip when destroyed.</p>\n<p>Destroying an enemy while it is attacking increases the odds of a drop.</p>\n<p>When you have full power, you will automatically enter Power Mode, tripling the shots from your main guns.</p>\n<p>After 6 seconds, you will exit Power Mode. Time spent in hyperspace (between waves) doesn't count.</p>\n<p>Collecting Power Pips while in Power Mode extends the timer. Getting hit reduces it.</p>\r\nBonuses\r\n<p>Every 10,000 points a bonus missile will appear.</p>\n<p>Damaging a bonus missile enough turns it into a bonus heart (1-up)!</p>\n<p>Be careful! Damaging a bonus heart too much destroys it!</p>\n<p>Collecting a bonus missile while you have 3 missiles or a bonus heart while you have 3 lives awards 1,000 points.</p>\r\nScoring\r\n<p>Destroying more powerful enemies awards more points (indicated in the top middle).</p>\n<p>Destroying an enemy while it is attacking increases your chain (indicated below score).</p>\n<p>Continuing to destroy enemies during their attack awards bravery points based on your chain.</p>\n<p>Watch out! If you destroy an enemy during its attack, another enemy will immediately attack in retaliation!</p>\n<p>If an enemy completes an attack run, you will lose your chain.</p>\n<p>If your score is high enough, you will be able to enter your name in the highscore table!</p>\n<p>Use Up/Down to change the letter, use Right/O to move to the next letter, use Left/X to move to the previous letter.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All art, music, sounds, and code were created by R.
