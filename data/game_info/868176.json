{"id": 868176, "slug": "closer-to-home", "name": "Closer To Home", "name_original": "Closer To Home", "description": "<strong>Closer To Home</strong> is a primarily dialogue-focused surreal horror exploration game. As you navigate the world and talk to its inhabitants you will come into possession of items that allow progression through the game. Ability granting items are explained in inventory descriptions. The world occasionally changes, so be observant of audio and visual changes. Check back in on the world's inhabitants from time to time, as they remember you. Please read the content warnings if you are one to heed them. I made this game entirely on my own, without any prior experience, so do not be surprised if you find a bug here or there.
