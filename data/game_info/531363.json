You go through a portal that teleports you to a garden, and fantastic creatures guide you through the space.\u00a0 This project provides a safe-space for those who struggle to find a place of comfort and happiness throughout their day-to-day lives. Once someone has experienced The Garden, it becomes a place that can be revisited as many times as one wants. I want to create a pleasant memory; a sanctuary for people to revisit whenever they want. The human brain is a powerful creative tool; a portal into many realms. Our subconscious manifests itself within our dreams. Even though dreams are only simulations, our minds put us in \u2018imagined\u2019 situations and we live through them. The experience is real even if it isn\u2019t accomplished in the physical realm.\u00a0 We may doubt that The Garden exists as real, but once we experience it we understand that it is genuine nonetheless--even if it\u2019s just inside our minds or inside a video game. No matter how we see it, we lived it; the experience is real.<br/></p>\n<p>This project stems from my own personal experiences and daydreams: I think of it as a secret feel-good tool kit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I believe we all deserve a place to retreat and feel secure. Not many can afford the luxuries of travel and so The Garden is a way for one\u2019s mind to take a vacation but also ease the conscience. It\u2019s a way for people to find light in the dark; to find hope when all seems lost.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T05:51:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e1/5e1280c7253a94c9f6c88771d24c0103.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aya.Avalon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
