Little by little, the witch must learn the ropes of running\u00a0the apothecary and gently bring it back to life. She must discover hidden stories, master her craft and grow as a witch;\u00a0only then will she get the key to break her curse.</em><br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed by Team Sunfly, a group of 5 with a shared love for game development and storytelling. Wanting to add a brand new flavour to the theme of \u2018food\u2019, we decided to sprinkle a little bit of magic into it; from the place where our game takes place, to the outlandish drinks we serve, right down to the customers that visit our humble little apothecary. Set in modern times with hints of desi roots, <em>\u2018Potion Cure\u2019 </em>is a HCG game that contains more than what meets the eye.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Some of the magical customers we feature are:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Guardian of the Apple Trees</li><li>The Dhol Ghoul</li><li>The Pigeon Triplet</li><li>Ghost of Eras Past</li><li>Punk Rock Djinn</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Instructions to play:</strong><br/>Make potions by\u00a0<strong>dragging and dropping</strong>\u00a0the correct ingredients- as per the given recipe cards-\u00a0into the cauldron and\u00a0<strong>clicking on the ladle</strong>\u00a0to stir before bottling it all up.
