Developed in two weeks by my little solo-dev self\u00a0for My First Game Jam (it's actually my second game jam, but they said that's okay). With this sketch of a game, I wanted to explore the idea of a game where everything changes with the push of a button. It has just a touch of narrative, a sprinkling of game mechanics and I hope you enjoy it!<br/></p>\n<p>Game developed by Laurie Noel<br/>Art by Laurie Noel and the GB Studio Tutorial Game</p>\n<p>(Music wasn't within the scope of the jam, but this is a nice listen while playing.)</p>\n<p>Recommendation: play with some notepaper handy.\u00a0If controls don't seem to work on launch, try clicking inside the game window.</p>\n<p>If you experience any bugs please let me know!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoyed what I\u00a0made?\u00a0Say thanks with a ko-fi.
