Carl convinced them to come with him because someone told him there was a device there called a phone making strange sounds. It was also said to be haunted by a purple man (the man behind the slaughte-) with a top hat, and he was hoping with someone as cool as Rabbo and as useful but lame and passive-aggressive and annoying and fearful and bad smelling and weird as Cheesemouth to come with him. Anyways, they only have flashlights, bats, and buckets to fend off the monsters that lurk in...Freak's Forest.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Quagmire &amp; Cartoon Rabbit's Goal:</p>\n\n<p>To grab all the players and drag them into the cave before time runs out</p>\n<p>Carl, Cheesemouth, and Rabbo's Goal:</p>\n<p>\u00a0Keep the shed's power on and survive the clock (and the monsters)</p>\n<p>Carl</p>\n<p>Use the up arrow to jump and the left and right arrows to run. Tapping the jump key will make you jump lower, whereas pressing it will do the opposite. Pressing M in the air will make you perform a charge jump and give you a big air boost. Pressing M on the ground will make you use the tool you have equipped. Press the down arrow while in front of a tool at the shed to equip or unequip it.</p>\n<p>Cheesemouth</p>\n<p>Use W to jump and A and D to run. Tapping the jump key will make you jump lower, whereas pressing it will do the opposite. Pressing E in the air will make you perform a charge jump and give you a big air boost. Pressing E on the ground will make you use the tool you have equipped. Press S while in front of a tool at the shed to equip or unequip it.</p>\n<p>Rabbo</p>\n<p>Use T to jump and F and H to run. Tapping the jump key will make you jump lower, whereas pressing it will do the opposite. Pressing Y in the air will make you perform a charge jump and give you a big air boost. Pressing Y on the ground will make you use the tool you have equipped. Press G while in front of a tool at the shed to equip or unequip it.</p>\n<p>Jump while stunned to get up. Press the 'equip button' while touching a shed powerline to repair it. Repair all damaged powerlines to restore the power to the shed. The timer will pause if the power to the shed goes out and will not start back up until it's restored. If the shed runs out of power it will become transparent and not be able to keep Quagmire or Cartoon Rabbit out, making you vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Quagmire &amp; Cartoon Rabbit</p>\n<p>Use I to jump and J and L to run. Tapping the jump key will make you jump lower, whereas pressing it will do the opposite. Pressing O on the ground will make you attack. Pressing P on the ground will make you grab. Press P while holding someone to drop them. Press K while at the starting area (cave/rock) to swap between characters.</p>\n<p>Cartoon Rabbit is much faster and his hits launch farther than Quagmire, but his hits are much harder to land. Quagmire's grab is also significantly easier to grab with than Cartoon Rabbit's. The flashlight is only effective on Cartoon Rabbit and the bucket is only effective on Quagmire, while the bat is effective on both AND has knockback, but does not stun either of them. Cartoon Rabbit is also stunned for longer than Quagmire. The only way to get out of a grab is for Quagmire or Cartoon Rabbit to be hit/stunned.</p>\n<p>@Whatsisname3\u00a0(Scratch) - Skid#1584 (Discord)\u00a0(now the official composer of Capybara Carl Moves Out) inspired me to make this game with his awesome music (which is in the game).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T15:48:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f27/f27b8c31437bd7e486283431c83fb550.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["RayFwafwa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
