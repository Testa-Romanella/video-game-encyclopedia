Within this digital nightmare, few things are certain, other than that you will fail. Luckily, that's not a big deal.</p><p>IHTBAC is a game centered around completing challenging levels, in the fastest time possible. The game features 26 carefully crafted levels and bronze, silver and gold times to beat for each of them.</p><p>If you can get all gold, get in touch.

It's a precision platformer based around time-trials, with 26 levels that start hard and get harder.
