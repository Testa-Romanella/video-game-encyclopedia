We took 2 weeks to design a game with the goal of using an alternate controller. To do so, we chose to link mushrooms to the device \"Makey makey\" (&gt;\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU) to serve our purpose.\u00a0<br/>- Host tells the fatal destiny of a parasitized insect controlled by a cordyceps (a mushroom). The parasite is controlled by a reproduction of the interior architecture of its host.\u00a0<br/>The goal is to guide the insect as far as possible, attracted to danger like its peers.\u00a0<br/>- I took care of the creation of the characters, including the player, the insects and the boss. I also did some concept for the main menu, the introduction and the \"Game over\" screen.\u00a0<br/>If you like the project, do not hesitate to listen the soundtrack of our Sound designer!
