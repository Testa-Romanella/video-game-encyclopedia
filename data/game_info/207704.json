Initial work resulted in a simple C# that sim-\r\nulated the SIR model. This was then extended to become the central behavior in a\r\nshort game. Both the simple script and the model in the game were evaluated to\r\nensure their accurate portrayal of the model. The prototype for this game was then\r\ndeployed to several participants in two short evaluation experiments. Though nei-\r\nther work demonstrated a conclusive trend, the work within provides some insight\r\ninto creating a game that conveys information about the SIR model of epidemics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f7/6f7c17078c42ca020f6d2aa3999d0e0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mateovargas"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
