You have been warned.\r\n</p>\n<p>I made this game using an old 90's engine called Klik &amp; Play, and I recompiled it using ANOTHER 90's game engine, called The Games Factory, to give the game support for 64-bit systems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Potato game. TOO!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Too</strong>\u00a0times the fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Too</strong>\u00a0times the challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Too</strong>\u00a0times the potato.</p>\n<p>WARNING: This game contains potatoes, ghosts, space, PINGAS guards, and a stupidly big file size. You have been warned.\r\n</p>\n<p>Potato game. Too! is (obviously) a\u00a0sequel to Potato game. (if you haven't already played the first one, do it now) It was created ENTIRELY using The Games Factory, Klik &amp; Play's sucessor. This is probably my biggest project yet, and it shows. (i mean come on, LOOK AT THAT FILE SIZE) I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Potato game.
