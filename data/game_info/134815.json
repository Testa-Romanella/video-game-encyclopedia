When an enemy is fully inside its outline, press Z or X on your keyboard (or alternate between the two). Enemies approach you keeping time with the music, so try to use sound to help you time your hits!</p>\n<p>Your ability to hit the enemies in time with the music will affect your Soul Purity. Will you become a WARRIOR OF LIGHT, or sink to the levels of HELLSPAWN? (The game is pretty challenging, so don't worry if you're not perfect the first time -- keep practicing!)<br/></p>\n<p>Rhythm Salvation was made by two developers at Paralune for the Summer 2018 UE4 jam. It's inspired by personal experiences with guilt, self-punishment, and OCD, but we also just wanted to make a fun rhythm game.</p>\n<p>Let us know what you think in the comments!</p>\n\n<p>INSTALLATION:</p>\n<p>Unzip the download folder and run the \"UE4Jam2018.exe\" executable.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0c/c0c776c2f957510beff20004b9e0d498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paralune"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
