So are we, which is why we searched the corners of the internet for all the humor we could find and used it to create an AI. It doesn't come with a whitepaper, it wasn't built by scientists, and it certainly doesn't benefit society. It is however, hilarious.<br/><br/>That's right, we trained an AI to be funny and made it into a party game.<br/><br/>Turing Quest pits you and your friends against our humorous AI to write jokes. Players will vote on if your joke or an AI generated response was better. It's a chaotic, edgy, and hilarious experience for up to 6 players.<h3>How It Works</h3><ul><li> Start the game and display on a TV, a large monitor, or screen share for remote play with Discord / Zoom / Steam Broadcast or similar service.<br/></li><li> Players connect to the game on their phone's web browser.<br/></li><li> Each player constructs a question which someone else will have to answer.<br/></li><li> Everyone writes funny answers to each other's questions.<br/></li><li> Answers are mixed with AI responses.<br/></li><li> Players all vote on who's answer is funniest, the human player's or AI's.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T04:16:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a92/a92b2900a0196bb807b1b13c671806d6.jpg", "website": "https://turingquest.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Kranial"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kranial"], "esrb_rating": null}
