The player has nothing to defend or attack, just a flashlight to see better. Only after taking the first page, does the player begin to be chased by the creature known as Slender Man, a tall, faceless man who wears a suit and is able to stretch his limbs. When Slender Man is nearby, the game screen will be noisy. The degree of difficulty and the music of the game change as the pages are collected. The game ends after the player has taken the 6 pages.</p>\n<p>Download the full version from the google play store\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.juliopepe.slenderblocks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T05:11:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ca/6caa197dbf6c587bb4197badf623b46a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Julio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
