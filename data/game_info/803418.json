{"id": 803418, "slug": "path-of-magical-words", "name": "Path of Magical Words", "name_original": "Path of Magical Words", "description": "<p>Path of Magical Words is a word building game in which you have nine randomly drawn letters for word formation in each round. The goal is to collect as many points as possible by the end of the game. One of the sources of points is the 1-9 points rewards placed in the occupiable squares of the playing field. 100 points are awarded if the playing field is fully explored, i.e. no square is left covered. Joining in the scattered pre-entered letters earns 5 points per piece, and if all of them are used by the end of the game, an additional 50 points are awarded. There are also various objects marked with pictures on the playing field (hovering the cursor over them or tapping on the touch screen will display the word), which will earn you 10 points per item and another round. If all these objects are used, it is worth 100 points. The point values awarded for the words created are influenced by the number of new letters on the board:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>1-4 letters - 0 points\r\n</li><li>5 letters - 5 points\r\n</li><li>6 letters - 10 points\r\n</li><li>7 letters - 15 points\r\n</li><li>8 letters - 20 points\r\n</li><li>9 letters - 25 points</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T15:35:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7d/d7d039498f077ee0a12c23de74da08bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["betuTboy"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
