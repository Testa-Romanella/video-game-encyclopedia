Pick the right cup and feel good about yourself for having extremely big brain\u00a0or extreme good luck. Play with your friends if you have any :). If you don't, don't worry the computer is there to play with you all day and it will never get tired with you :).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, don't forget to use the shuffle increase and decrease in main menu. You can have infinite amount of shuffles if you want. You just have to use the left mouse button to increase and right mouse button to decrease the number of shuffles. I hope you use this feature a lot :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T11:21:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79f/79fef7a9dda33b1a3cddd8f32287f31b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Marqueeplier"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
