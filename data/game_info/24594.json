Select from either an analog or digital clock and set up \n      to three alarms (with snooze functionality for those that need it). Make \n      your own Town Tune or use sounds created in Nintendo DSi Sound, and \n      assign them to the alarms you\u2019ve set. Use the system's internal clock or \n      offset the time however you like. Then sit back and watch as different \n      characters from Animal Crossing appear and the color of the sky changes \n      as time passes. Never miss an important appointment with one of your \n      Animal Crossing friends again!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12ceb17956711eef4a020fe773ede73b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
