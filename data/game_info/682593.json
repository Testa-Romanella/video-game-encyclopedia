When you have filled a row or a column then it disappears. You can't rotate the pieces, they are rotated themself. The game is over when your current piece is nowhere fitting in the box.</p>\n<p>Controls are 1, 2, 3 (select the piece) and cursor-keys for moving and space-bar for setting the piece.</p>\n<p>The original game is a C64-Game (freeware) by Nick Sherman of the last year.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55d/55daff55b0fd94af8a9f677d9044638c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bardon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
