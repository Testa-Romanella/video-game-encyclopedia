Thank you so much for supporting my game!\r\n<p>Aeon\u2019s Destiny is a <strong>5 \u2013 10 hour indie RPG</strong> with <strong>8 unique endings</strong>,\u00a0set in the fantasy world of Eruto. The player controls a fallen paladin who has lost his memories, found crashed onto the floor of a forest by an old man. He is soon tasked with\u00a0protecting Aeon, a quiet girl from Eldigen Village who has somehow absorbed the powers of the fallen God, Fortuna. Along with Aeon\u2019s rage-filled brother Zave and comically wacky alchemist Epora, the group journeys to Mt. Alpho, far to the North, in the hope to communicate with the remaining Gods and prevent the imbalance that is slowly killing their world.</p>\n<p><strong>FREE STRATEGY GUIDE (PDF) INCLUDED WITH EVERY PURCHASE. :)</strong></p>\n<p>The game was passionately created and balanced by Lewis Wood over a period of around 1 year. I have dreamed about creating my own video game all my life, and here it is!!\u00a0I welcome ALL constructive criticism and feedback to make this game the best it can be. Thanks again for supporting my JRPG style game!</p>\n<p><strong>ALTERNATIVELY</strong>,\u00a0the <strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> of the game is for kind people who would love to give that extra level of financial support\u00a0- the player will begin the game with a Key to a previous-inaccessible house in the starting village of Eldigen, containing great early-game equipment, an assortment of useful consumables, a free bed to rest in, and a sneak-peak at an upcoming project.\u00a0<strong>This is totally optional and really appreciated, and does not affect the balance of the base game.</strong></p>\n<p><em>(Save files may not transfer between versions, so if you would purchase the Deluxe Edition please begin playing it instead of the base edition).</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T05:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/052fcd3d3cdb79a67576b6dd52345b70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lewis1992"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
