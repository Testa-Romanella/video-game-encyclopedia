A lack of physics knowledge and the challenge of drawing the trajectories at a reasonable speed defeated me.\u00a0Over two decades later, and inspired by the nostalgia of the recent Black Mirror special\u00a0Bandersnatch, I\u00a0decided to have another crack at it. I\u00a0used\u00a0Wikipedia\u00a0to create the physics model,\u00a0and with some tricks I\u00a0got the trajectory traces\u00a0fast enough\u00a0to make the game viable.</p>\n<p>This work is free to download, but it remains protected by copyright, and I offer no licence to the user.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>I\u00a0started this Sinclair BASIC game\u00a0almost 25 years ago using\u00a0a Spectrum +2 and a C60 cassette tape.
