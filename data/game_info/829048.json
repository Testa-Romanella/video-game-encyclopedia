Open the multi-tool to fix them with the right tools (play matching sounds). The flashlight lets you equip it for some seconds. The Oxygen Tank gives you oxygen and unlocks the next platform. Move to the left to fall to the next platform. You don't need to fix the flashlight to get to the next level. If your oxygen runs out you lose and return to the main menu.\r\n</p>\r\nSOUND PUZZLE\r\n<p>When you play the sounds with the multitool you have to keep track how many you played. The puzzle resets every time you play a full set of notes. eg. if you hear the notes A, C, F#. you have to play sets of 3. once you play 3 notes if they dont match the puzzle your note reset, so if you play G, A, C, F# even though the A C F# sounds correct, the game will have registered G A C, reset, F#...(waiting for the rest)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T07:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec0/ec0a4ffc863e9bf42c17b94c046157be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlanIII"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
