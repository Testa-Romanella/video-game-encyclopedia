This game is all about Turtalia's newest species, the Turtalians. The Turtalians are a mutated species of turtle discovered on the planet Turtalia in 3087, by Dr. Joseph Wrench. Joe's idea of their origins is that back in 2037, when the first manned rocket ship exited the solar system, they brought turtles to see if they could find a planet that can support life. They found the then-unnamed Turtalia, and left the turtles on the planet. Then they went back to earth to tell NASA about their discoveries. However, they didn't compensate enough for the planet's extra gravity, and they crash-landed back on the planet. Dr. Joe thinks that while they were gone, the local wildlife caused the turtles' anatomy to drastically change, and thus came the Turtalians. But the other sentient wildlife didn't take too fondly to the new invasive species. Now you, Dan D. Lione, 5th leader of The Turtalian Empire, must defend your country, do you have what it takes?\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T04:22:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/808/80815a6e11c8d4e4f954c5e0538e5e6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WrapWrenchGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
