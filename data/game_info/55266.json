The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version was developed by Funcom on contract with Disney and was released on January 1, 1996. It was followed by a later version for the Game Boy developed by Tiertex Design Studios and released on June 10, 1996, nearly a year after the film's premiere. A Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game was under development around the same time as the Mega Drive/Genesis version, but was canceled due to development being too far behind to coincide with the Mega Drive/Genesis release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-12T16:10:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/217/21794484383090f357aff7117bb9e631.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 24, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 24, "platforms": ["Game Boy", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Funcom", "Tiertex Design Studios", "Tiertex"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Disney Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
