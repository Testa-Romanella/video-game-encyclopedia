Im not lying.</p>\n<p>This game was made in about 2 hours and 30 minuites on the first monday of the summer in 2020.

Most big things I work on dont get released on my itch.io though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T06:49:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f3f463a60c91bf869db140a6d05ad52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Redfive11"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
