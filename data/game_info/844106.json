From the lowliest Push and Pull Bots used to carefully handle your precious luggage, to the ZappBots who are there to keep you safe from any stray homicidal aliens. We put them all through a set of carefully crafted scenarios, to make sure that nothing can possibly go wrong.</p>\n<p>Take control of the bots and help in training them how to move cargo to the teleport points without losing any to hostile aliens or overzealous ZappBots. Once you have completed all the training levels you will be qualified as a fully affiliated Bot Pilot, and be able to apply for positions in our team.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move.</p>\n<p>X to start</p>\n<p>R to Restart Level</p>\n<p>U/Z to Undo</p>\n<p>Waggle your fingers on mobile, but best played with a keyboard.</p>\n<p>Use Level Select to select a level!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T17:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6a/b6ae3eb4b8d135c171f53c3a5be26193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrBedfordVan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
