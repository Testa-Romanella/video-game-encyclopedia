Now held captive by the mysterious \"C.E.O.\", you must help him escape while traversing 15 random levels, collecting orbs and fighting dangerous bosses. A challenging cartoony throwback to a bygone era of hardcore arcade-style fun. 100 cards to collect! Over 20 trophies to earn! Unlock extra modes, including local co-op! Join Karl and banish evil from this building once and for all. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is a series of levels given at random. You never know which stage will be next in a playthrough. Each of the 3 zones pick 5 stages randomly. Much of the challenge comes from learning the best way to traverse a level. Also, Karl cannot fall too far or its curtains for him! Every stage contains 15 glowing orbs and one treasure chest. You must collect at least 10 orbs to complete the stage, or get them all for a perfect score. Time is also a factor, due to a ticking bonus clock. Speedruns net the most massive scores, and are fun and challenging. Do you have what it takes to collect all 15 orbs on every stage?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T18:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/92487664b3360749cf6af16ca2ff88bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Disaster Squad Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Disaster Squad Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
