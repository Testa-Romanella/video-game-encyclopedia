To make it so you don't have to just guess whether there's a pair like that, I made it so if you chord, and there's a pair in the way, it doesn't clear those spaces. Chording is when you click on a number, and the flags around it match the number, so you can quickly clear the empty spaces.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T11:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9c/a9c1bde35fbf0a82220946fa29c8423e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["duncanacnud"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
