It's summer\". This game is a story based first person 3D farming simulator. The story revolves around a Dylan, a 20's something man who has been sent to his grandfathers barn to help him out in his farm help by planting crops, feeding the animals and then selling them at his home shop. The more the quality of his crops are the better amount he receives eventually leading to shorter amount of work he has to do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The factors affecting the quality of crops will be depended upon the time at which they are watered and fertilizers and spray are used at the right time which is depended on an algorithm that is individual to each plant.</p>\n<p>What I envision is to port this game into VR. Heavy optimizations are required to do so. I am certain that this will be done in a month or under. I have completed making almost 70% of the game. This is the first prototype I built.I have 2 more levels which are essential to the story and hope you will enjoy it whenever it's made\u00a0\u00a0and make you happy just as it made me when I thought about it.</p>\n<p>As you know VR development is quite expensive, any donation will help. If it receives enough amount of support I will make it my top priority and finish it at soon as possible.
