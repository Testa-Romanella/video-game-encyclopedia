This game is inspired by Move or Die, Cosmic Chaos, Brawlhala and Gang Beasts. The concept idea for this game is:</p><p>\"How can simple-randomized control blockers be used to support replayability in couch party games, that allow users to network and create a sense of community?\"<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The initial state of the game has 2 mini-games but later down the line, I will be adding more. Please donate if you liked the game though, means a lot.<br/><br/><strong>Side note: You need to play the game with at least two people on one device. So a controller is needed.<br/></strong></p><p>Credits: <strong>@arsenite.wav</strong> for making the game poster.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T09:10:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27b/27b2fd1bbeb2f8f76e61aed6ae36577c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Khatim Javed"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
