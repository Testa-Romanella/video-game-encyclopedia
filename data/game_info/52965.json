However a scientist named Dr. Minimizer has an idea: using a device he calls &quot;The Minimizer Ray&quot;, he will shrink the planet&#39;s population to 1/360 of its original size, and so create a world more suitable to our current status. If this is to be successful, the doctor needs to create a supersoldier: somebody who can prepare the planet for us when we are eventually minimized. In order to do this, the doctor enlists the help of 12 volunteers for an experiment. The experiment consists of racetracks that are considered various dangerous environments as to ascertain the suitable skills for the supersoldier. </p>\n<p>Micro Maniacs (FoxKids.com Micro Maniacs Racing in North America) is a racing video game developed by Codemasters for PlayStation and Game Boy Color. It is a spin-off to the Micro Machines games, the main difference being that players control tiny characters where a few racetracks feature the use of vehicles. The North American version was sponsored by Fox Kids, and so the game&#39;s name was changed there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-13T17:54:43", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Codemasters"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["THQ", "Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
