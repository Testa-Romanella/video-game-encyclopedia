A game with only one button! Destroy stuff!<br/><br/>This is a game I made for the FUN button one button game jam. Besides the menus, all you do in the game is hit space (or click the fun button).\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the button is pressed and you are close enough to a surface directly under you, the arrow will go up and down. When the button is released, you will be launched relative to how far the arrow was extended. Complete objectives and destroy notable signs for combos. Combo count also goes up every 8 seconds as long as you hit something every 2 seconds.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Some notes:</strong><br/><br/>There are 4 cut-scenes in the game. Each getting progressively crazier. The first is right when you start the game, the other three happen when you finish a level of objectives (objectives are saved round-to-round).<br/><br/>\u00a0A couple of the level 3 objectives are really difficult. I wonder if anyone will even see the last cut-scene because of them(specifically the coke bottle and the water towers. 100k for high score might be difficult too but I think is probably do-able if you are really going for it).<br/><br/>Known issues:<br/>Once in a while you will take a hard bounce off of a light pole. So far I\u00a0am just chalking it up to Unity physics.<br/><br/>Thanks to:<br/>Filebase from GamedevHQ.com<br/>Catlike coding<br/>Music licensed from arlist.io:<br/>Duda by Ian Post<br/>Freerolling by T.
