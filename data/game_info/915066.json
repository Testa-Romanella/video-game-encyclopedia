In fact, it was less of a peace than it was an absolute silence.\r\nHow long has it been since there's been any real excitement? They say that hardly anyone comes into the bookshop anymore...\r\nThose were the rumors stirring in the village. In truth, it seemed that the youkai and gods of Gensokyo had lost any sort of \"passion\"-- their drive, their joviality, their petty squabbles, and most of all, their interest in humanity. This was a cause for concern.\r\nIf youkai and gods simply went without interacting with humans in any capacity, then sooner or later, their very existence would be threatened. And after all, Gensokyo was constructed for their preservation.\r\nAnd yet, in the midst of this, there were still reports of fairies that maintained constant uproar. Of course, this drew suspicion.\r\nLuckily, there were those who held passions so burning\u00a0that somehow, they went entirely unaffected. Sensing something wrong, they went into action.\"\r\n<p><strong><em>Ecstatic and Expressive Allies</em>\u00a0</strong>is a short, one-stage shoot-em-up that is a Touhou Project derivative work. In it, pick between four difficulties and\u00a0two teams and battle against a new and\u00a0original character based on Roman mythology, with original danmaku patterns.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Play as Reimu and Marisa, the lovely Forward-Focused Adoration\u00a0Type, or play as Yuyuko and Yukari, the cunning Any Way Wide Type.\r\n</p>\n<p>Touhou Project original concept, characters, and other elements are the property of ZUN and Team Shanghai Alice.
