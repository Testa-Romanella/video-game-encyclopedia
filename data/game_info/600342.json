It sounds simple but you'll find some very passive aggressive shadows along the way.\r\n </p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>There  are plenty of trees and cliffs around, dash around the shadows that  inconvenience you. Or go ahead and attack them if you are so bold. You  only have 45 seconds in each level to get to the gate before you start  to bleed out and die.\r\n </p>\r\nEnemies\r\n<p>There are 8 different  enemies to encounter; ranging from large to tiny. You can choose to  avoid them or take them head on! Attack with SPACE or X on your  controller. The enemies can not hurt you though!\r\n </p>\r\nItems\r\n<p><em>Treasure Chests</em> - Contain Hearts and Coins! There will be one on each level that also contains the key to escape!\r\n </p>\n<p><em>Coins</em> - Use coins to purchase extra hearts on the title screen! Just Dash with L-CTRL or B on your controller.\r\n </p>\n<p><em>Hearts</em> - These will recover those you've lost. They can be found in treasure chests.\r\n </p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Controller Support\r\n</li><li>Save and Load system\r\n</li><li>Decent art for a guy that isn't an artist\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6f/f6fb9100315ef9f801f6fc6bb25307af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patrick"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
