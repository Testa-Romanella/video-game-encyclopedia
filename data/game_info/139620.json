The aim of the game is to keep them from falling into your area and hitting the water by tapping each one, which releases a defensive orb.</p><p>If you make a hit, you destroy the threat, but if you miss you'll just have one more falling object to deal with when gravity brings your orb back towards you twice as fast.</p><p>So rather than just tapping away blindly, Vanish requires precision and timing. The movements and speeds of the falling balls can be unpredictable as you progress, adding something of a wrinkle into the game and throwing gamers off. The longer you keep your area protected, the higher your score!</p><p>Expect to addicted within minutes, and at times, slightly mad at yourself as you're sure to make mistakes in the early going!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e28/e28207581558afa80f25055e8aa4819b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["The Mascoteers"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
