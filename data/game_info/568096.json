I thought I fixed it but I guess it's still broken :D</li></ul>\n<p>How it fits into the jam theme:</p>\n<ul><li>The theme was \"failure is progress\". I decided to make a small exploration game where you die every 10 seconds but\u00a0keep your progress. At the beginning you only have enough time to collect a few items and unlock a few doors, but as the game continues you can unlock more battery-packs which gives you more and more time to explore.</li></ul>Haiku, the Robot - full game\r\n<p>Currently, I am developing <strong>Haiku, the Robot </strong>(the real game) full-time. It's a cute robot\u00a0Metroidvania game set in a post-apocalyptic world of machinery.

Only a few lines of code were reused from other projects.</li><li>All music and sound effects were from freesound.org.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4f24b4b9c121f822c444e67fbad3772.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mister Morris"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
