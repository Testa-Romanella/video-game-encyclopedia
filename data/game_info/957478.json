A small village was right outside the forest where the witch resided, and the villagers were very fearful of this wicked sorceress. It was said that the witch would curse any villager who dared venturing near her cottage, so no one dared coming close to the witch to confirm their superstitions. Rumors said that even the witch was cursed herself, but the witch had long forgotten what spell had been cast, if any, that would cause such rumor and gossip. Even so, the witch and the villagers continued living their lives as distant neighbors, until one day a brave young man from the village came to ask a favor of the witch, for his ailing wife.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>2 Beautifully illustrated CGs<br/></li><li>1 Ending<br/></li><li>Platform : PC/Online<br/></li><li>Rated : E10+</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T08:09:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afc/afc81ef68e3ff41814e892c74af5671a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sonya Fung"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["CloudNovel"], "esrb_rating": null}
