Collect all of the tomte and progress through sixteen bite-sized stages.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nA gust of icy wind blew open Kimmy's front door, allowing her curious tomte to mosey out and travel through a magical door. Jump, avoid critters and falling ice, then catch all of your tomte as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nD-Pad -&gt; Control Kimmy\r\n<strong>A Button -&gt; Jump, Navigate the Menu</strong>\n<strong>B Button\u00a0-&gt; View the Previous Menu Option</strong>\r\nStart -&gt; Pauses the Game\r\n\r\n<em>Tomte Trouble</em>\u00a0follows a simple gameplay loop: collect all of the tomte on the screen to open the magical door to the next stage.\u00a0\r\nColliding with falling icicles or animals will force Kimmy to take a breather, sending her back to the stage's start position.\r\nBecause the tomte love you, collecting one as you collide with a critter may briefly protect you from needing to take a breather.\r\nOn average, a single playthrough of <em>Tomte Trouble</em> will take 3 minutes, depending on your platforming experience. You will see your total time in seconds after each stage (this timer excludes pauses, stage-clear text windows, and cutscenes). Careful platforming and speed will reward you with a better clear rank, ranging from S to C. Earning a B or higher will unlock additional background palettes. Share your final time and clear rank in the comments!\r\n\n<em>Tomte Trouble </em>was explicitly designed for the Game Boy Color. The game has been tested and runs properly on software emulators, FPGA devices such as the MiSTer, flash carts with original Hardware, and the Analogue Pocket.\u00a0\r\nPlease Note: <em>Tomte Trouble</em> is incompatible with the original Game Boy and its revisions, including the Super Game Boy. The game also uses an auto-save feature for unlocked backgrounds.\r\nPurchasing\u00a0<em>Tomte Trouble</em> will grant you access to a Game Boy Color ROM, an Analogue Pocket File, and an experimental Nintendo 64 ROM. A text file for emulating\u00a0<em>Tomte Trouble</em> is also included.\r\n\r\nCreated by Next Day Games\r\nGraphics &amp; Design by Anders Mattson\r\nMusic by Pete Jonas\r\nMade with GB Studio &amp; Aseprite\r\nFonts: GBS Sans by Joel J Games,\u00a0PIXELS-R-US by castpixel,\u00a0\u00a0Silver by Poppy Works\r\nA special thanks to\u00a0the playtesters and the GB Studio community.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T16:07:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b9/3b93e9b67baed0ed303e61a30299eb3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Next Day Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
