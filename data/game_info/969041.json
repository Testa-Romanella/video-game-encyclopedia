Additional functionality will be implemented in the future. Also, current functionality may be altered or removed with or without notice.)<br/><br/>A PvP indie pixel-art monster battler with a unique approach to turn-based combat. Choose your moves 3 turns ahead... and create a \"Plan B\" for if things go wrong! Will you wield your contingency plans to create ambiguous multi-layered strategies, or to fortify a brute-force offense?<br/><br/>Choose from a diverse pool of Creatures, each with their own unique attacks and animations, to build a team that suits your preferences. Then go head-to-head against other players online.<br/><br/>This game's system is unique in that players must publicly declare their moves up to 3 turns in advance. However, what a player says they're going to do might not match their real intentions -- with \"Contingency Plans,\" a player can make secret modifications to their publicly-stated orders that only take effect if certain conditions are met! The key to victory is to thwart the opponent's publicly-declared moves while trying not to inadvertently trigger their Contingency Plans.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T01:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/452/452e37ffbd3418438069b8ec58c02276.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brian Ito-Kiley"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brian Ito-Kiley"], "esrb_rating": null}
