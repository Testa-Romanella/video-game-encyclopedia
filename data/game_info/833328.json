Each would have different buffs and you would get more points for delivering correct cool snacks to the NPCs. But I had some major technical difficulties getting to grips with game development after a 4+ year hiatus.</p>\n<p>As a result, all I was able to put together is a small map, a single NPC sprite (the red slime) and a few lolly textures, but they only differ visually. The game is also missing audio as I had lost several hours of progress with just one day to go.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The world and the main character are based on a 3rd party assets from the Modern Exteriors asset pack\u00a0by limezu<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Note, I updated this submission a day later because I've made a few errors in the export. The only changes are:</p>\n<p>- the game is no longer exported in `debug` mode so it should actually run relatively okay</p>\n<p>- the game icon has been set</p>\n<p>- there is a web version available</p>\n<p>Other than that what you see here today is exactly what I've had made within the jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T17:24:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e300f0521b3dd10550e6613d1f315e18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["NBGamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
