Dash, shoot, teleport and enter the stage to fight in unique arenas, featuring impossible geometry, where there is no right side up and death comes from any direction.<br/><br/>Set in an alternative universe, where the Roman Empire never collapsed, you take on the role of a new breed of a gladiator on your road to becoming a champion. Use your speed, aim, and wits to outmaneuver and defeat your enemies, reducing them to a puddle beneath your feet.<br/><br/><strong>Core Features</strong><br/><ul><li><strong>Loadout Management</strong> \u2013 Players have a chance to utilize different loadouts, comprised of weapons, throwable buffs/ de-buffs, shields and teleport methods. At any given time, the player has 3 active slots for combinations of those elements.

The game allows for switching the player's primary hand.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Teleport Attacks and telefrags</strong> \u2013 Teleport is contact weapons inflicting \"Melee Damage\" at the same time allowing the player to move through play space, thus adding an extra layer to the standard teleport mechanic used in VR.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Guns</strong> \u2013 Guns are ranged weapons inflicting \"Range Damage\" upon the target.

Their downside is their vulnerability to teleport attacks.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Dash</strong> \u2013 allows for short and fast jumps from place to place on a given surface. This is the primary mode of locomotion in Telefrag VR.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Impossible spaces</strong> \u2013 Walkable surfaces can be placed regardless of gravity, meaning the player can travel on any designated surface regardless of its rotation and position relative to the \u201ctrue\u201d ground.

Players are matched against each other, their loadouts put as a wager for the outcome of the match. The winner may take the losers equipment. Both Player receive currency at the end of the match based on their score. The losing party can buy back their lost loadout. Currency multiplier is applied for each won match, effectively introducing a \u201cwin streak\u201d mechanic.</li></ul><br/><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br/>Telefrag will feature a full arena game mode, where players stand head to head in 1v1 battles, their hard-earned loadouts as wagers.

No problem, teleport through your enemies to see them reduced to a pulp.<br/><br/><strong>Shooter</strong><br/>Block incoming shots with an energy shield and shoot your opponents with a range of firearms, from the staples of the genre to new and unique entries.
