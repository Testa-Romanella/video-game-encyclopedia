The goal was to add a door or animation when you finished the level to leave the boxy level, hence the title. I also would have liked to add more levels with more challenges: spikes, enemies, and gaps in the wall you can fall through.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T12:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d1/5d15f524d0a9235c1b5ee50c950c9577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NewShamu"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
