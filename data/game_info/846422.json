The behavior of the machine is calculated using the laws of the real physical world. You won't be able to pass this game just by pressing the gas pedal. On any bump, you can be carried off the track. The passage time is limited, but you can extend it by collecting the appropriate items. Part of the route will need to be passed with a top view, the other part - with a first-person view.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T06:22:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57e/57e151b39aa8dbf61a23bfe1474f8674.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aleksey"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["AlekseyN"], "esrb_rating": null}
