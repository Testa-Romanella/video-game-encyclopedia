Right now you can play 5 stages and defeat 4 bosses. There are more 10 stages and bosses planned for the 1.0 release.</em></p>\r\nIf you're a weirdo like me who always wanted to play as many digimon as possible in a platformer game, this fan-game is\u00a0for you.\r\n<p><em>Scroll down to download the game!</em></p>\n<ul><li>When the 1.0 comes out, you'll be able to play as <strong>48 </strong>child/rookie digimon. And each single one will be able to digivolve at least 2 levels and most of them 3 levels (<em>adult/champion &gt; perfect/ultimate &gt; ultimate/mega</em>).</li><li>Each character is able to perform a <em>physical attack</em> and a <em>ranged skill</em>. Some of them also have abilities like <em>flight</em>\u00a0or <em>swimming</em>.</li></ul>\n<p>This is <em>not </em>just a promise though, most of them are already programmed in, gameplay wise.\u00a0I just need to finish the stages and the interface in which they'll be unlocked and selected. I plan to release the final build still this <em>semester</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>If you play the game, please feel free to leave feedback, specially if you find any bug :)</strong></p>\n<p>And the game is using <em>japanese </em>names. Just personal preference, nothing else.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T04:00:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/448/448141f124fed9a1aa4b296bc3e43f5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 28, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sette fan-games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
