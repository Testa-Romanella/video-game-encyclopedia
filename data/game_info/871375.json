So there will be multiple challenging levels.</p>\n<p>3)\u00a0Im going to try and make a new enemy with different features, like size and maybe I can create a script of my own that allows the new enemy to do something none of the others can.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0am also going to try and potentially reskin the character, although I am not too much of a fan of the idea of trying to reskin the character because I attempted to reskin the character in my 2D shooter and faced difficulty with making my reskin appear, and this project requires me to create falling, dying, and running animations, so there's no guarantee I'll have time to complete this modification.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Created by Yusuf Nashif\r\n</p>\n<p>Assets By: CAS 117</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T06:08:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b6ca8c980b850a79176881cb4420aed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["nashifyu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
