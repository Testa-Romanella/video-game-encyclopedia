Why do I bother?</em><br/>\n</p><p>\n<em>Walking to Sad Pianos While Pressing W</em> is a pretentious waste of time and space. You are some beardman walking around a city. Then it ends. It's got achievements though. Kids like those.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>Walking to Sad Pianos</em> was a mistake.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tInspired by such \"masterpieces\" as Polygon's Game of the Year \r\n\t<em>Gone Home</em>, the actually great <em>Stanley Parable</em>, and the awful, awful, worthless piece of crap created by that non-dev FoldableHuman called <em>Resist</em>, which this game is a parody of, or something. I forgot what I was doing half-way through.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBlah.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tInspired by this tweet:\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\thttps://twitter.com/GamingAndPandas/status/582740995185324032\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlso inspired by this game:\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\thttp://thebestgamers.net/art.html\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t(Just in case there's any shenanigans: The reviews inside the game from Polygon and Kotaku are obviously fake. I shouldn't even have to say this.)\r\n</p>PRESS<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tThe great guys at \r\n\tlo-ping.org (i.e. the guys who inspired me to make the game in the first place) made this Polygon-tastic video review that's here on YouTube. So go watch that instead:\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlso, Michael Campbell (@EvilBobDALMYT) wrote for Super Nerd Land a review of the game, which is here.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\thttp://supernerdland.com/walking-to-sad-pianos-while-pressing-w-review/\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tWHY IS THERE A TEN MINUTE REVIEW OF THE GAME \u2014 WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? I mean, The Button Buddies guys at Digitato played my game recently apparently maybe, so there you go. (Warning: It spoils the entire \"game\". Did I say \"warning\"? I meant \"pro-tip\".)\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tI feel as if I had vomited over a carpet, and people had stood around to contemplate the stain.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfb/cfb85b734c66c40819850bbfeed324e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MarsCat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
