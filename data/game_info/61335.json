Each stage will be unique and modeled around the opponent. Stages could also have sudden changes in combat mechanics, like switching from the usual free-roam to a platformer.<br/><br/>The concept is simple, your goal is to deplete the enemy's health bar before they do the same to you.<br/><br/>You attack by staying on top of a white-bordered object, most commonly a circle. <br/><br/>You have to stay on it long enough for the white parts to completely disappear to cause damage to the enemy.<br/><br/>That's easier said than done because the enemy will throw everything its got at you to keep you off it.<br/><br/>If you find yourself low on health, chase the green HP Savers.<br/><br/>It's up to you to decide how risky you want to play it.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e2/5e266a06a2531a209a8943e11e7dfa01.jpg", "website": "https://www.metanormalgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Melancholic Nights Studio"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Melancholic Nights Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
