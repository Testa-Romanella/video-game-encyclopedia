He must therefore hack the NASA servers in order to access his PC remotely. The only computer available is an old PC from his childhood. He must therefore hack 6 computers in order to obtain the computing power necessary to crack NASA's servers.</p>\n<p>\u200cThe game is turn-based pok\u00e9mon style. There are six computers to defeat. Each one will give you access to its characteristic attack. There are a total of 11 different attacks.</p>\n<p>\u200c We are two to have developed the game, in 4 days. This is our very first jame game. Our team is made up of a programmer and a designer / animator.</p>\n<p>We were obviously not able to integrate all the functionalities planned at the base.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite everything, we are very proud of the final rendering of the project. The development was difficult and tiring, but really rewarding.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credit:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming: Dorian Sanjivy\u00a0</p>\n<p>Visual / Animations: Abel Graux</p>\n<p>Without forgetting all our friends who supported us during this project.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Adam Haynes and ThePrimeCronus for allowing us to use their music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b9/2b9b0c271bac474e7c6b602e9db7f0f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Les Gros Shlags"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
