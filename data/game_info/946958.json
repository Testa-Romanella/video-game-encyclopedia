You can use it to tilt your matchstick down for increasing the amount of light radiating from the flame. Be careful though, this also increases how fast your matchstick burns down.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T07:06:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/705/705dc8f6955b917e99d0a9f5f28c8156.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScallyGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
