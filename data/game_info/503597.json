{"id": 503597, "slug": "hyper-racer", "name": "Hyper Racer", "name_original": "Hyper Racer", "description": "<p>In this Ludum Dare 47 Entry (Theme was stuck in a loop), you race on the insides of a tube in the depths of space! Compete against yourself for space and master the curvy nature of the tracks. How many laps can you complete?</p>\n<p><strong>THIS GAME IS BEST PLAYED ON A CONTROLLER, SITTING DOWN, WITH A FORWARD LEANING STANCE FOR MAXIMUM COMPETITIVENESS.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>This game is a basic prototype made within 72 hours by 3 brilliant artists and 2 programmers! The game is by no means complete and contains a few features that we weren't able to fully implement due to the nature of game jams.<br/></p>\n<p>Here's a rundown of what we managed to achieve and what we were aiming for!</p>\n<p>The game contains a few maps for you to explore, namely an easy and a medium one. We had so many ideas for tracks and track segments, but the poor art team already had so much on their plates that we decided to bite off more than we could chew.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Our character drives around the tubes in a fashion very similarly to the way mario runs around the planets and stuff in Mario Galaxy, but we just flip the normals so that you drive on the inside of a mesh (well it was modeled as our outside).</p>\n\n<p>The music was intended to get more intense and groovey with each lap, but we weren't able to get proper bopping dynamic music in because none of us are musicians and 72 hours isn't long enough to learn the ins and outs of music. We made an attempt and after a few laps, it switches to some much better tunes to please your ears! <br/></p>\n<p>We weren't able to stop the player from turning around and going the wrong direction, which means that you could just go across the start finish line a billion times, but we really don't recommend that, because that's not fun :(</p>\n<p><strong>Progression</strong></p>\n<p>As you complete laps, a new ghost spawns where you first started your race! This means, the new ghost will be really slow but will eventually get up to speed many laps later. During this time, your speed will increase with each lap meaning you get a chance to overtake the ghosts with sheer pace, and not just driving ability alone</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><ul><li>Environment Art - Alex Akins</li><li>UI Art - Maxime Vincent, George Nikolaou</li><li>Vehicle Design - Maxime Vincent</li><li>Programming - William Akins, Gregory Neale</li><li>Music &amp; Audio - William Akins, Gregory Neale</li></ul><p>Additional Music by:</p>\n<ul><li>Purple Planet Music </li><li>Our Music Box</li></ul>\n<p>Spline Mesh tool we adapted for our game:</p>\n<ul><li>Benoit Dumas</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Change Log (Bug Fixes the latest version includes)</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Fixed game breaking bug on the expert map that would allow you to fly away with your car, lol</li><li>Fixed bug where your car would detech from the map on the expert map when going down steep slopes</li><li>Fixed audio issue where a new audio track would begin playing over each other every lap until your ear bleed</li><li>Fixed issue where you could not quit the game (Well you could but you were basically crashing it, and windows forced closed the game)</li><li>Fixed some collision issues where your car would get stuck in the ground, (some of these still persist in latest)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:13:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e76/e7665d84ebc2357129162a35eab8cef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 385, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Will", "AlexAkins", "Gregory Neale", "Yung Wheenus", "MaxDaMiner"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
