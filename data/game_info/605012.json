This characteristic makes the neuronal circuits malleable and is at the basis of the formation of memories and learning as well as in the adaptation to injuries and traumatic events throughout adult life. A game has been created in Unity, in which there is a main neuron, called Player, that has to be able to go through a maze in the maximum time stipulated. During his journey, he will encounter several neurons with whom he will establish connections. However, the neurons in the labyrinth are of three types: blue and green that add time and red ones that subtract time and chase the Player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T08:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fd21a9ea6304ad63a859259be2e6fea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["francisco25meira"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
