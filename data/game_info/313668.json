I was unable to submit the game on time as I went over the deadline by a few minutes. Still pretty rough around the edges, but is any jam game ever polished? In any case, I still wanted to share it as a stepping stone on my way to learn Unity.</p>\n<p>The theme was Childhood Dreams. The idea I wanted to implement was a child dreaming about his favorite games and wanting to develop one himself. It's a little auto-biographical. The gameplay involves jumping at the text bubbles and some lite-platforming.</p>\n<p>Several resources were used in this game such as: <em>Supercyan Character Pack Free Sample</em> available on the Unity Asset Store, the music track called <em>Happy Arcade Tune</em> by Rezoner found on opengameart.org, and the sound effect used for the text bubble was also found on opengameart.org.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard: <strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> to move and turn, <strong>SPACE</strong> to jump, <strong>C</strong> to switch camera towards front or back, <strong>ESC to close game</strong>.</p>\n<p>Gamepad (360, untested with other gamepads): <strong>Left Analog</strong> for movement, <strong>A</strong> to jump, <strong>B</strong> to switch camera towards front or back, <strong>Back </strong>button to quit game.</p>\n<p><strong>BUGS</strong></p>\n<p>There's a bug with the controller (at least on my end, let me know if the same happens to you), when I click <strong>B</strong> to change the camera, the game is no longer active with the controller but the browser instead. I then have to click in the game window again to make it active. Going fullscreen prevents this.</p><p>Sometimes pressing the jump button multiple times will make the character \"fly\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T06:44:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dc/8dc9921d41e59cee8f1c87c75342c08b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Burnerknight Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
