Our aggressive King is about to start another war and it is inevitable that he will eventually. We can delay the inevitable by delivering beer into his castle for free. That'll hold the old sod up for a while. However, don't forget to sell beer to the locals to compensate for your efforts. You can also buy and sell other goods to increase your income.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the way, the king expects you to accumulate a fortune of 1,000,000 gold coins.
