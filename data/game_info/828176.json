You'll be able to explore some of its remains, and get lost in the endless fog of this mysterious place.<br/><br/>This project wasn't made for the purpose of being a video game. It's a digital interactive piece of art. Therefore, gameplay and storytelling were put aside for this project. The world the spectator sets foot in is based on a world I developed through an illustrated work called <em>Megalostructure</em>. A series of pictures depicting the layered world with its different locations <em>Forgotten City</em> is set in. The objective of this interactive piece of art was to get the feeling of jumping into those images, and get lost inside them.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> = Move Around<br/><strong>Mouse</strong> = Look Around<br/><strong>F</strong> = Flashlight On/Off<br/></p>\n<p>If you are interested in <em>Megalostructure</em>, here's a link to see more of this world:<br/>https://www.artstation.com/artwork/4XeeZ4<br/></p><p>Main 3D modeling, texturing, and programming were made by myself.<br/>A few 3D models, as well as all the soundscape are free to use elements found on the internet.</p><p>Forgotten City was made in Unreal Engine.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T16:42:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50d/50dda8929815c3f2d655cda572455e35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roy Acquasaliente"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
