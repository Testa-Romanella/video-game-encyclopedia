Most of the music and assets were taken from other places, though Dragon\u00a0Adventure contains the most hand-made/modified assets. The games are truly not great, but they're a fun look back at where I started.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0re-discovered these games recently as I\u00a0was looking through an old external hard drive, and I\u00a0didn't want to lose them again. The hype in the\u00a0descriptions above are certainly jokes, but I'm honestly pretty proud of what 15-year-old me was able to accomplish, and it led me down the path of making some real things 10 years later.</p>\n<p>I hope I'm able to continue on this path and make some even better stuff farther down the line.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The download for this collection is a\u00a0.zip\u00a0folder that contains sub-folders README.txt files and the game's executable. Read the README to learn more about the game, and read the in-game instructions to learn how to play each game.</p>\n<p>The executables themselves were created on a Windows XP machine using Game Maker 4, which should mean they'll run on just about any Windows machine (I tested them on my fully-updated Windows 10 machine and a Windows 7 machine\u00a0and they were all\u00a0fine), and I bet it will run in Linux with probably any version of WINE.</p>\n<p>Just unzip the file and\u00a0run the executable, and it should launch the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f84b11ab2d7bdf67f63064b31eb2db1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alamantus GameDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
