Only then does the head of the caterpillar become vulnerable. Beware though as the caterpillar can regrow its body parts upon contact with them, with it's speed increasing (or decreasing) depending on the amount of body parts it is composed of.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a8b64048cd76d1dba50d612861c2499.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Henry Threadwell"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
