When you drive, using controls causes them to freeze/disappear for an increasing duration. The control scheme may abruptly swap on certain power ups. You may even be forced to remap controls from other directions when you run out of required controls when hurtling towards a bend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f3a1b1d1d02bc31b4dc958553fc04ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hpurane"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
