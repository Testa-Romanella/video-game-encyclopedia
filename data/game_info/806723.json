You can have dance-offs with disco goers and possess them to make them dance with other disco goers. You can also shoot funky \"powder\" to get them in the mood for some groove.<br/> There are multiple floors you can switch between but be careful. There are disco goers that are stronger than others and don't give in to the funk so easily. You can possess stronger enemies to give yourself an easier time on your feet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-21T00:48:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/958/958e86c54914968809d11102810cf102.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Breda University of Applied Sciences"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
