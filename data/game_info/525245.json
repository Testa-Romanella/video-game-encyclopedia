Grab three of your friends, and create a room (using an identical room name as eachother!) and you'll be able to choose from 1 of 4 currently playable characters. Once chosen, you'll all be thrust directly into a boss fight potentially in the full game. **Warning!** This current build is not easy!\u00a0It is difficult for a single person to beat, and without team work it could be hard for even 4! Work together and keep each other in the fight as you take down this boss.</p><p>For the full ability list of each playable character,\u00a0please refer to this Imgur Link:\u00a0</p><p>https://imgur.com/a/M4h5Zku</p><p>When you are attacked by the boss, and your health bar becomes empty, you will be KO-ed and unable to cast abilities. If you are KO-ed that's okay! Your allies can pick you back up by simply healing you in any way, shape, or form. If all of you and your allies are KO-ed, there are none of you that can continue the fight...meaning you have failed. Once this has happened, everyone will need to reset the game in order to try again!</p><p>In the upper right is a WIP section, to give you a short preview of the opening cutscene into the game. I hope you find all of this both fun, and interesting, and I hope for your continued support during the development of The Indigo Project 366!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T04:55:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee5030045282790f40ccb25a2519e0cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlueScarfGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
