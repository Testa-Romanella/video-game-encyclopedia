Once they begin a job, they're racing the clock, and so are you. They can't wait for you to finish hacking or dodging police. Be ready when they are. Fortunately, they're not COMPLETELY suicidal. They'll let you know how long before they dive, so keep an eye on your timer.</p><p>\n<br/>\r\n\tDROPS ONBOARD - This is how many Dead Drops are aboard your current ride. Fly off either side of your display, and our operatives will take your car the rest of the way to safety. You'll need to hack another if there are more Drops left. Now, as long as you don't have any Drops aboard when your dumbass either crashes, gets lost in the smog, or gets caught by the fuzz, you can just hack another and carry on. Use this to your advantage to distract cops with captured decoys.</p><p>\r\n\tDROPS SAFE - The number on the left is how many drops you've gotten to safety, the number on the right is how many drops are working the job. I think you can figure out the rest.</p><p><strong>What is a Dead Drop:</strong></p><p>\r\n\tIf data = $$$, Dead Drops are the bank robbers. Elite hackers, these \r\nbrave souls break into data centers and take all they can. \r\nUnfortunately, they tend to alert security in the process. Since going \r\none on one with armed guards is suicide, they do the next logical thing:\r\n Dive out the nearest window.</p><p>\n<br/>\r\n\tThat's where you come in. As a TranJack, your job is to hack into the \r\nlocal traffic control database and secure a getaway vehicle. Once \r\nacquired, snatch the Dead Drops and get them to safety before they, and \r\nmore importantly their stolen data, are either captured by the Police or\r\n end up organic graffiti on the pavement below.</p><p>Twitter: @BerickCook</p><p>Email: BerickCook@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f09/f093e3bac61a99ba543475d846e593f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BerickCook"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
