I know reuploading games is against the rules, but my original submission was literally unplayable so who cares, it wasn't going to win haha.</p>\n<p>Literally, my first ever game dev project that I've actually kind of finished, it's not perfect by any means but at least you can shoot stuff.\u00a0 I know it's not that fun to play but gets better the further you progress. Enjoy!<br/><br/>Thank you for the feedback and support.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T11:24:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c80/c805429460fcfd0d281d5806c48de857.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Username.png"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
