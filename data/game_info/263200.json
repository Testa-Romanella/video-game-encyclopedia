Achieve Neon Dark.</p>\n<p>The dystopian 3D platformer Neon Dark was a passion project by me, Matthew (it was also a proof of concept that I could make something). I made everything except the skybox (yes, the music and sound effects, sprites, animations etc.). It was originally going to be a 3rd person survival shooter. But I guess enough of those exist (that and initial technical difficulties got in the way). Anyway, it ended up being a speedrunning first person game where you have a blaster and jetpack, and you have to race around a very vertical level destroying generators to dim the lights. When the lights are black, you win! Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Feel free to post your time in the comments\u00a0(my best so far is 01:11.65).</p>\n<p>Best time: DogStylist with 00:59.53</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a24/a24c3bb21e6c67d8999d0ff534b26340.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Daymare5"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
