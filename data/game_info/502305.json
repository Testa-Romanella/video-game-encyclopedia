{"id": 502305, "slug": "psychonaut", "name": "Psychonaut", "name_original": "Psychonaut", "description": "<p>Submitted to the Unusual Suspects Jam.\u00a0A Custom playbook for Blades in the dark!</p><p>On the underworld of The Dusk, knowledge is the one thing that can keep your body and\u00a0spirit togheter. The more exclusive it is, the better. Thinning the veil between this world and\u00a0what lies beyond, psychonauts may be the perfect sources - if you find one that is reliable\u00a0enough.<br/><br/>Psychonauts uncover what lies beyond perception. The use of hallucinogenic methods are the price they pay to leave their bodies and embark on inner voyages where they meet the threads that connect all forms of consciousness. Some of them develop tics, unnaturally rigid\u00a0habits, strange postures or colored, exposed veins from their most recent journeys in the unknown.</p><p>When you play a psychonaut, you gain XP when addressing challenges with<br/>mind-altering techniques or esoteric insight. Use all manners of substances and<br/>practices to lean on the borders of known reality, explore the depths of human psyche, and beyond. Manifest your power through sheer will - after all, eventually every scoundrel gets\u00a0insane or dead. Unlock what knowledge you can before you suffer either.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T03:39:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ce/7cece0669787298e2cbdc7b5f52ad83b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Guilherme Monocores"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
