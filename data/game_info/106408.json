However, that has not come without dissentions among the Sophorians, and sometimes very violent conflicts. In the recent past two huge attacks had occurred that threatened the whole civilization. The first one struck the government. The second one struck the Sophorian army. But was there a connection between those attacks, and will history repeat itself over and over until there's no civilization left? <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tIt has now been a year since a devastating EMP wave left one of the largest cities broken and disconnected. A lot of labour and resources went into restoring the city over the course of the year, but it appears things are not about to settle down yet. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tAdrial and his team of allies have been caught in another attack - but who is attacking this time and what are their motives?
