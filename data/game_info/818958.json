Would you keep your resolve when a mysterious force threathens to take that love away from you? Would you just roll the dice and be prepared to sacrifice everything?<br/><br/>You win a single battle by having higher Resolve value than your opponent which is indicated by the value in the middle of the card. Winning a battle gives you the dice from the middle of the board and you gain as much Lifepoints as the dies face value.<br/><br/>All the art in the game are procedurally generated by AI.<br/>Right Clicking a card will zoom in so you can see the effect more clearly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:21:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e604a63bfbc300e5c55f299671e3beb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PastoriVasara"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
