Created by variously gone-mad poets. 5 games.<br/>\r\nCurator: Ilia Mazo.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n1. \u00abThe Trolley Odyssey\u00bb. A parable about the path to a dream. The dream role belongs to a Mountain.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are a trolley. Rolling around the city through your trolley-life, you know. Passengers inside will get mad, if you get out of the way. But you will get out and get it. A dream. A Mountain. And then they will sing a song for the first time in their passenger life. A song about the journey and voices in our heads.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n2. \u00abA Silent Room\u00bb is an existential hokku. Don\u2019t you go outside without a hat?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCome in. Wellcome. A room. The room is always warm. It is funny, sad, calm, loud, and quiet inside. All your stuff is here, isn\u2019t it? Sure, it is. It is your room. Time passes by, things go away and leave marks in your head. The more you remember, the less air you have. Have you ever seen this place, these walls before? You have already been here. Come inside. Lie down. It is silent. It is always silent. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u00abThe Flower\u00bb is a dating-madness simulator. A flower afflatus, post-modern and post-psycho poetry. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter a long-long working day on a Plantation, you are in high spirits. Happy, right! Today is the day, today is the date with your lovely beloved. Your heart is burning, your breathing is rapid, the urban landscape around blooms in a euphoric frenzy of colors. Something makes you think better, feel better, see better, bloom better. But something is missing\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBouquet! It would be extremely unethical to show up for a date without a bunch of flowers. No problem, it has never been a problem for you. Look around. All you need is to pick a few flowers\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u00abORG\u00bb is a futuristic shoot-a-fable about the censor routine of the nearest future.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCongratulations! You have just got a promotion. From now on you are responsible for the art transfer through CAD (Culture Assurance Department). Be careful, the cultural enrichment of our clients lies in your hands.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe future is CAD. CAD is the Future.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u00abTicker\u00bb is a running-n-crying runner about the mind night, the utterance impossibility.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nShortly before going to bed, you uprise a few words in front of your eyes and write them down on a piece of paper. You will try to remember the words\u2019 order through falling asleep\u2026the words\u2026the order\u2026ords\u2026woder\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach pulsating beat of your sleepy mind brings you closer and closer to the non-verbalized world. There is nothing to say. Say no more.
