{"id": 45551, "slug": "skelattack", "name": "Skelattack", "name_original": "Skelattack", "description": "For centuries, mankind has traveled the land to raid dungeons for riches and glory.<br/><strong>This is not their story.</strong><br/><br/>I invite you to ponder what daily life is like for the dungeon-dwellers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You are Skully, an enchanted skeleton, living in the deepest part of the dungeon. You awaken to the terrible sound of the alarm Bell, letting you know that intruders have been seen within the dungeon. <br/><br/>Joined by your helpful bat companion Imber and armed with magic, you exit into the Sewers of the dungeon sword in hand to begin your hunt. Why are they here? No intruders can be left alive to tell of this place.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Dungeon Travel</strong><br/><br/>Making the player feel agile and in-control was a must from day one. You can jump, double-jump, and wall-slide on all surfaces. Your sword attacks are lightning-quick.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Dungeon Living</strong><br/><br/>There's lots to see in this massive dungeon. It is divided into distinct areas that serve a purpose for the entities who live there:<br/><br/><strong>The Sewer</strong> - dark and wet...the lowest part of the dungeon that handles waste management and water flow.<br/><strong>The Prison</strong> - where intruders unlucky enough to not be killed are left to starve in hanging cells.<br/><strong>The Greenery</strong> - where beautiful plants are cultivated.<br/><strong>The Library</strong> - full of the collective knowledge of the many who have lived in the dungeon.<br/><br/>...and much more as you explore the world of Skelattack to uncover why the \"heroes\" are raiding your dungeon!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Friendly Faces</strong><br/><br/>There will be a number of interesting characters to meet and chat with. Bouncing Jellies, Demons, and of course other skeletons. Many of these characters can assist you in some way, while others just want to chat or thank you for your service. Some of them (such as the Jellies) are too weak to defend themselves, and are incredibly grateful that you fight in their name.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Unfriendly Faces</strong><br/><br/>Raiders, thieves, and warriors from miles around have descended upon your home in search of treasure. The enemies you encounter will have strengths and powers that must be dealt with accordingly.<br/><br/><strong>Tribal Warriors</strong> - Not much for armor, but his punch will knock you back!<br/><strong>Knights</strong> - Beware the long reach of his sword! He is wearing armor as well, and can take more punishment.<br/><strong>Flame Mages</strong> - Physically weak, but will constantly launch fireballs at you when you're in range.<br/><strong>Armored Boss</strong> - Insane reach, HP and attack power. He's also accompanied by a flying beast that shoots magical in your direction. Getting close is risky.<br/><br/>...and others that are both challenging and fun!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Upgrades</strong><br/><br/>Within the dungeon you may find a Blacksmith who can surely improve the damage dealt by your sword!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Bat Companion</strong><br/><br/>Imber is your best friend, and always ready to chat! Talking with her during normal gameplay is completely optional, but it's interesting to hear what insights she may have about certain situations. She has amazing hearing, and can tell you if any enemies are still left in an area before you leave. She will handle all of your magic spells (as long as you have Magic Power). Don't leave home without her!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Magic Spells</strong><br/><br/>Use magic spells to destroy enemies or to help overcome obstacles. Imber can only carry one magic scroll at a time, so choose wisely! There will be areas in the game where you can exchange magic spells to change your dungeon-crawling strategy.<br/><br/><strong>Cure</strong> - heal a certain amount of HP<br/><strong>Fire</strong> - Shoot a wall of flames out from the ground in front of you and burn your enemies (or certain obstacles).<br/><strong>Air</strong> - Use this spell in the air to essentially get a 3rd jump! Useful for platforming and finding hidden areas.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Traps</strong><br/><br/>No dungeon is built for comfort. There are a number of pitfalls and traps that will kill you easily. Arrow traps, cursed runestones, spinning sawblades, and fall damage need to be handled with care. Be smart and use traps to your advantage to hurt your enemies!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Music</strong><br/><br/>We have an amazing bone-tingling soundtrack created by Jamal Green. Whether in the sewers, the greenery, or the library, the music sets the atmosphere for your journey.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Lore</strong><br/><br/>The world of Skelattack is rich with stories, history, and the memories of a booming society. Humans raid dungeons without a second thought to the lives of those inside. The inhabitants of the dungeon feel shunned by the world, and in many cases have turned to literature and the arts to have some semblance of a normal life. <br/><br/>Lore can be found by reading at book shelves. Each bit of lore is called randomly within the game, so you never know what you'll find next. All discovered Lore is saved into the Library, where it can be read at a later date, and in greater detail.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Puzzles</strong><br/><br/>While action is the name of the game, light-puzzles will help keep you on your toes as you traverse the levels of the dungeon. You'll need to pull some levers to unlock areas where enemies lurk, or be creative and find the right path leading to the exit. Knowing when and where to use certain magic spells is also important if you want to find all of the dungeon's secrets.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Saving</strong><br/><br/>Skelattack auto-saves in each new area but has built in checkpoints at the blue torches. Players respawn at the blue torches while game over is non-existent. The game remembers where you are, all of your stats, as well as any enemies you have killed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-16T15:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/362ea090d090d2cc1973a1b7faafda38.jpg", "website": "http://www.skelattack.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 47, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["David Stanley", "Ukuza"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Konami", "Ukuza"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
