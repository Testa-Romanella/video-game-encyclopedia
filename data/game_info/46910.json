R12.<br/><br/>In Cinderella Escape 2 Revenge, Cinderella is back with her new goddess power. She is going to reveal the Evil Plan of the Evil Prince and have her revenge. Therefore, the game is no longer a Puzzle Game, it's now an Action Game. <br/><br/>In order to acquire a better experience and enjoy Hack-n-Slash Action Game, I strongly recommend that you use a controller or gamepad to play this game. It's fully supported aside from the launcher. Have fun!<strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br/><ul><li>Hack and Slash Fighting Style<br/><br/>You've never seen a Fairytale princess fights like this. You can easily combine attack-A &amp; attack-B to develop your own fighting style. Dodging and Guarding are also available which makes the battle more exciting. Finally, a special attack is the most powerful technique to destroy large groups of enemies.<br/></li><li>Armor Break!<br/><br/>There is a gauge that shows the current durability of your clothes. Your clothes will break when the durability reaches zero. Once your clothes are broken, all damage you take will interrupt your attacks.<br/></li><li>Real-time Story Cutscenes<br/><br/>There are 33 cutscenes in this game. The story is quite funny. You'll find a very different concept about Snow White and Pinocchio and both of them connect to Cinderella's story.<br/></li><li>Costumes and Accessories<br/><br/>There are 4 parts that you can customize your character, including Hair, Lingerie, Clothing, Accessories.
