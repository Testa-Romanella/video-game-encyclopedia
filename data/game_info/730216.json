The player controls a cannon that can fire \u2018particles\u2019 (photons), with the goal of being absorbed by an electron.\r\n</p>\n<p>The photon can only be absorbed as a wave, so the player must switch it to acting as one.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, there are barriers in the way that will absorb the wave if it passes all the way through, or reflect the particle, lowering its speed. The particle can only bounce 6 times before it is destroyed. The player can switch the wave back to a particle by observing its position while it is part-way through a barrier, using quantum tunnelling to go through. The outside of the electron also acts as a barrier.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game supports keyboard and gamepad. Nintendo button labels have been used.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player can adjust the initial speed of the particle, which can increase or decrease the challenge to suit.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T06:48:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f29/f2944b1315677e734df42fd851a4251e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["aidan-hall"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
