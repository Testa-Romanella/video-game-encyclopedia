Destroy them before they reach the end of the screen. Don't forget to reload, each shell has four bullets. If just one robot manages to escape, you are doomed, and you'll have to start over.</p>\n<p>This game was made as an exercise for a videogame course. Everything on it was made by me except for the SFX and the music, which was made by Musicbed Artists.
