Move carefully young one.</p>\n\n<p>Created as part of\u00a0Game Maker's Toolkit Jam\r\n</p>\r\nGame Jam Stuff\r\n<p>This is my third game jam, first time doing one in 48 hours. This time I wanted to focus on gameplay, using a restricted color palette, animations, and actually doing the sounds myself. So this time I did everything and in a shorter period of time :)</p>\n<p>Given the theme of the jam, I decided to have my dual purpose design be that when you move you also attack. I also wanted to mimic the Otomata music sequencer for the audio. One thing led to another and my dual purpose design became quadruple: you move to attack, to see, and to play music. (Also the enemies only move when you do.)<br/></p>\n<p>I hope everyone enjoys it!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>EVERYTHING:\u00a0twitter.com/paigemarincak</li></ul>\r\nTools\r\n<ul><li>Game Engine: Game Maker Studio</li><li>Music: Audacity,\u00a0http://websynths.com/</li><li>Art: Pyxel Edit</li><li>Color Palette: http://riemea.deviantart.com/art/Limited-Palette-Color-Studies-386914904</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/213/2131086ce2357fdc96e07139da6557a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Atemly Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
