It's my biggest damedev project yet! I hope to get it finished and released within a few more months, but no promises.</p>\n<p>(o\uff9fv\uff9f)\u30ce</p>\n\n<p>Most controllers should be supported. However, it can also be played on a keyboard. Z/C is the \"O\" button and X/V is the \"X\" button.</p>\n<p>A note about how the game saves: Every time you enter the train car with the exit door, the game saves. This is the only way to save though, and even though there are checkpoints throughout the levels, you have to beat the level in order to be able to save the game (this is due to the limitations of PICO-8 and how I chose to program my game).</p>\n<p>And if you choose to play the browser version, be warned: It may or may not save your progress. And if it does save, it might get deleted somehow later. So it's a safer bet to go with the download.<br/></p>\n<p>Oh and please let me know if you experience any bugs or notice the game misbehaving in any way! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T08:35:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4d/a4d882d720bbb42d53a30b84c45adf26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["The Mace"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
