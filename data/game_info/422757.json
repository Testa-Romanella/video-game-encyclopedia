In order to help Pilot cope, her mind is split into two. Maybe she can keep herself company.</em><br/></p>\n<p>I challenged myself to make a short visual novel in 3 days. I'd been sitting on this idea for a while, but was finally motivated to make it, mainly because I am stuck inside and have nothing else to do but social-distancing and Animal Crossing. Thank you coronavirus. Anyway, please enjoy! - Denny</p>\n<p>Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Tumblr\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Twitch\u00a0| Behind the Scenes | OST</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:58:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a5/9a548f079629092b70b61c4490fc4180.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["90% Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
