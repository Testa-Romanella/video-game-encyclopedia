However because of your devotion to the time warping arts, you forgot all of your basic of magic! Rewind through time to change your age and use different magic spells. Can you defeat all the waves of\u00a0the dungeon?</p>\n<p>Waves of enemies will come, to complete a wave you kill the enemies with your spells. Change age to change your spells. Each age has four spells each for:\u00a0fire, water, earth and air. To change age you need a Time Point(bottom right).\u00a0Depending on your age spells do more or less damage and cost more or less mana. If you run out of mana there are a\u00a0few spots that spawn mana pickups as well as enemies dropping pickups for mana, health, and time points.</p>\n<p>The Orb on the right is health, left is mana.\u00a0The green bar on the right tells you when you get your next time point. Total time points is also there. The bottom left tell you your current school of magic. The bar at the top fills with wave progress.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>HOLD TAB - Open the age change menu, use A and D to change</p>\n<p>HOLD SHIFT - Open the spell type change menu, use A and D to change</p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK - Cast spell at mouse position</p>\n<p><strong>Spells Cheat Sheet</strong></p>\r\nElderAdultTeenChildFireMeteorFire StormFire StreamFire BallWaterTsunamiBlizzardHealBubbleEarthEarthquakeWallSandsOfTimePebbleAirTyphoonMisty StepGustHaste\r\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>All assets made by me during jam time except for the following:</p>\n<p>A* pathfinding:\u00a0https://arongranberg.com/astar/</p>\n<p>Sound effects from:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.gamemasteraudio.com/</p>\n<p>Font from:\u00a0https://www.1001freefonts.com/</p>\n<p>Tools Used:</p>\n<p>Aseprite:\u00a0https://www.aseprite.org/</p>\n<p>Waveform free:\u00a0https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-free</p>\n<p>Unity:\u00a0https://unity.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Notes/Thoughts:</strong></p>\n<p>This game has so much more potential then i released for the jam. Out of all my jam games i most want to continue working on this one and will definitely come back to this. This jam ended up being pretty scuffed for me, I only worked on this for around 48 hours in total and a lot of that was in art.
