Use gorillas to capture monkey-generating shrines, or send your sword-wielding monkeys to thin the enemy horde. Protect and defend the central sanctuary from the enemy horde that threatens the jungle!<br/></p>\n<p>Our game was inspired by the Chilean idiom \"monos con navaja\", literally \"monkeys with pocketknives,\"\u00a0which is akin to saying\u00a0 \"a bull in a china shop,\" but the stakes are greater. The idea is that you'd control a large number of chaotic monkeys, and you have to protect and defend your own monkeys and towers--not only from your opponent, but also from your own unruly and unwieldy \"monos con navaja\".<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS -\u00a0Player 1</strong><br/>WASD to move<br/>Space to swap between monkeys and gorillas</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS -\u00a0Player 1</strong><br/>Arrow keys to move<br/>Enter to swap between monkeys and gorillas<br/></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>THE INDIE GAME JAM,\u00a0PRESENTED BY SCHICK HYDRO<br/></strong>This game was created as part of \"The Indie Game Jam, presented by Schick Hydro\" in partnership with Playcrafting.
