The theme of the jam was scarcity. I implemented scarcity by giving the player a limited amount of time to finish each level. In addition, I gave the player a special ability that greatly helps complete the objective of the level.\u00a0 This special ability can only be used a certain amount of time for each level. <strong>Perspective</strong> features five short levels featuring challenges that the player must complete using his special ability while making sure that they beat the clock.   </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Have fun - Braydpoul\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>http://www.purple-planet.com/</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCuU3AOdtYsVxWrS4ECP4VA<br/></p>\n<p>I would also like to thank my brother for helping me out with some of the art.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/625920ff6d482bf2507e54fa23033bd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["braydpoul"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
