Space to Jump, Arrow Keys, or WASD to move,\u00a0 'r' to restart. This game is a simple, yet difficult platformer made using Unity. Only 10 levels but may take a long time to beat(30min-1hour, maybe less if you are great at games like this), some people may even believe it to be impossible-trust me, it's not impossible. Every level has been thoroughly tested and they are all beatable... just a little difficult.\u00a0Screenshot the game end screen and post it in the comments to brag that you can beat it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T10:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58f/58f6c12dd31c0e499e2861bdd50ce3f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lzimm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
