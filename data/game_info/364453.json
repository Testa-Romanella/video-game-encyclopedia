Offering more than 190 levels distributed in many different country sections with unique backround and designs, it will take you a long time to play through all levels. Levels themselves are not easy to beat and may enrage you.\u00a0 I'd be really happy if you supported the game if you see potential in it, updates will be coming! Have fun!(Bearbeitet)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T06:19:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4e/f4ef54848ea51a01fb03348c8ad94d4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vescito"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
