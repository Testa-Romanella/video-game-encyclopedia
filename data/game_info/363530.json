More information on\u00a0http://meditations.games/</p>\n<p>Big thanks to\u00a0Santiago Molina for letting me use his song\u00a0Mui\u00f1eira de Poio in the game.</p>\n<p>This is the description included in the Meditations launcher:<br/><em>On this day, each year, I used to climb a mountain to join a local party with my grandad. He was my role model, and taught me to always try to be a better person. I learned from him that the actions of an individual make a difference in the life of other people. Helping other people makes us all stronger. I grew up and eventually moved to another country. The first year I missed that climb... was his first time missing it too, as he died a few days before. On this day, each year, my mind goes back to that mountain with him. He made a difference in my life for the better, and I try my best to follow his footsteps.</em></p>\n<p>P.S: The game is shared as is. It's a small free project, and as such I can't give support or updates for it. Sorry about that!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T08:04:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e3ae57cf242075ca3ef3004be51f967.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Bit Byte Bear"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
