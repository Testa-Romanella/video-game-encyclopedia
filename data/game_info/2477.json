Joined at the waist, you and your partner share a long, wriggling body as you wrestle your opponents for control of the ball. Since you're sharing the same body, you'll need to carefully communicate (or just shout a lot). With every action affecting both you and your partner, PMPY combines the best parts of co-op multiplayer with the worst parts of your last breakup.  <br/><br/><ul><li>Frantic local multiplayer gameplay in the vein of Sportsfriends or Towerfall.  <br/></li><li>Compete in multiple game types that will test your friendship in different ways, or play around in a sandbox area filled with toys and secrets.  <br/></li><li>Low on controllers? Share a controller with a friend or try controlling two heads simultaneously - a two-player game can be played with just one controller!   <br/></li><li>Accessible yet deep - play it as a noisy party game or hold a fiercely competitive grudge match. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T23:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca0/ca03dffd877079b99d95d8788c500aa7.jpg", "website": "http://pmpygame.com/", "rating": 3.92, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 48, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 8, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["House House", "House House Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["House House"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
