You must go through the levels, dodging bullets and enemy attacks to avoid losing more time! You can collect more time along the way by destroying turrets, killing red dudes or collecting time pickups scattered around each level!</p>\n<p>Did you know, this game was created in UE4? The most top notch, non buggy software to ever be created? We totally did not lose 2 days of work whilst working on this game jam, like, that would be an insane accusation towards UE4, the greatest development tool!
