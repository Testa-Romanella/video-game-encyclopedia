Your ship is equipped with support boosters, that will make your ship travel along with arena, letting you focus on shooting the aliens and avoiding incoming fire. Keep in mind tho, that boosters have limited fuel, that replenishes by shooting down aliens. You can see boosters' status via bar that appears above the crosshair.</p><p>This is an old game that I made in 2015 for Clickteam's 20-event competition, that had all contestants make small, simple games that consist of maximum 20 events per frame in any software made by Clickteam. I have used Multimedia Fusion 2 to make this game. It won second place in the contest. Kinda forgot about it, and now I\u00a0decided to just post it here. Maybe you'll have some fun with it.
