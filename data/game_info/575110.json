We're not insinuating that this is the <em>only</em> family that have survived this unspecified catastrophe, but for the sake of the game you're about to play, it's one family. Partly that's to drive home the sense of loneliness and isolation that one presumably feels while wandering the barren wastelands of the aftertimes, but partly it's so our artist only had to draw, like, four people. But I get ahead of myself.</p>\n<p>In <em>Together</em>, four family members are separated from each other in underground bunkers, whose designers had the expertise to make completely resistant to nuclear hellfire but not the foresight to put a door handle on the inside. Thankfully, their eldest child - Becky, I think it was? - is able to hack the planet, or something to that effect, thus saving them from starving to death in a cold basement and saving you from not having a game to play.<br/></p>\n<p>We hope that this brief description has enticed you to press the download button. If not, that's cool too. It's the apocalypse, you're allowed to be chill about this sort of thing.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Design &amp; code by <strong>Aaron Winter</strong><br/>Pixel art by <strong>Jerico Landry<br/></strong>Character portraits by <strong>Ruben Gardiner</strong><br/>Sound design &amp; music by <strong>John Gabriel</strong></p>\n<p><em>Together</em> was made for the thirty-first Godot Wild Jam.<br/>The soundtrack is available here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T04:26:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26cab9e5c596ceb8ed9b3aef81f8191c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JohnGabrielUK", "Bitron", "D4yz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
