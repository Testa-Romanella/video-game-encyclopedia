Some are rewarding. Some are punishing. And some are life ending. This is the very heart of the Game\u00a0Dance of The Damned (Which will henceforth be abbreviated as\u00a0DOTD). A medieval RPG puzzle game that tests memory, reflexes, and problem-solving skills. This game doesn't focus a lot on turn-based combat but is a story driven game. That being said before each battle a character is given a new combat skill to help them win. But these fights are no pushover. Even the first one can end badly if you are not paying attention. Sometimes even before the battle can begin. There are also knowledge skills that can help solve problems. The story's core revolves around four distinct characters. A group of outcasts banded together through happenstance and necessity. Drawn to the siren's call of a cursed mansion. But in order for them to embark on that harrowing journey within, they must first survive the town surrounding it. DOTD comes with its own gathering and crafting system. Along with a Quest Log, lighting system, and Trailblazing skills. Trailblazing skills allow characters to overcome physical obstacles on the map.\r\n\r\nMY ROLE:\u00a0I will be the head writer, lead game designer, and overall head honcho of the project.\r\nPositions/Roles Needed: I'm seeking a scripter. Or at least someone that understands scripting.\u00a0I'm also\u00a0looking for a great mapper that can help bring this world to life. To bring forth the horror, mystery, and claustrophobia feeling of being trapped in an unforgiving mansion. Where monsters and ghosts roam the halls waiting to be released upon unexpecting 'Champions'. I'll also need a pixel artist to create the various items needed to solve the puzzles of the Mansions. Ones that match with the default items of the game. I am open to other positions that can also make DOTD better and appreciate any advice.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T06:44:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/755/7554f3232b52bb63606b90d223e7aa87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tanarex"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
