Between 12 hour weekend shifts, tractors with flat tyres and then a full time game dev week day job I didn't get to put in the time and effort I had hoped for this. I'd say less than 6 hours of work actually was put into this game and most was spent faffing about with art.</p>\n<p>This was a very good experience for myself however, I learned a lot of what goes into a Jam and I hope 40 will prove more successful!</p>\n<p>BUT! Here it is! No start menu! No End Screen! No Points! Time or any real relevance to running power!</p>\n<p>Fearghal</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59e9ca8f6c827e204b8ebe72f4ca2925.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fearghal124"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
