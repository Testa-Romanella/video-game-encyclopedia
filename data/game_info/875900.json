If you run out of ice cubes you loose\u00a0\r\n(the game will keep running, but just pretend you loose, and close out the window to restart)\u00a0\r\nSee how long you can survive!\u00a0\r\n(survival timer provided seperately, but your computer comes with one!)\u00a0\r\n\n\n<p>Made for the 0 hour jam, where you make a game during the hour of the daylight savings time switch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because the rules specifically stated that there were no rules, I opted to make my game during my lunch hour.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Only outside asset was a sprite sheet I made for someone else who never used it.

The couple of scripts you see me start with are some common ones from my library, which do snapping to the grid in the inspector, animations, and making an object persistent, but I only wound up using the first one.</p>\n<ul><li>I had written out a little plan for it but did not manage to complete everything. If I had a second hour I would have liked to:<br/>rotate the cannon to point at the mouse</li><li>spruce up the cannon ball image</li><li>have a game end condition (end of wave, or no more blocks)</li><li>make the clouds float</li><li>animate the enemies</li><li>show a window with your stats, whether you won or lost, and include a restart button.</li></ul>\n<p>Post Post Mortem:</p>\n<p>I spent another hour and basically accomplished the above items. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T15:58:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d81/d8136ff4d74f07c304a766dedc7490a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["juzek"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
