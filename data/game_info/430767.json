{"id": 430767, "slug": "lifeship", "name": "LifeShip", "name_original": "LifeShip", "description": "<p>You and your crew are stranded in a \u201cLifeShip\u201d after a catastrophic accident of the main ship. You must navigate star systems and collect essential resources to keep your crew alive. You have a very limited supply of fuel, oxygen, and food. Jump between systems and land on planets and rings to collect resources. Different planets yield different resources (fuel, oxygen, food) and some are more abundant than others. Eventually, safely reach a space station and bring your ship to safety. </p>\n<p>Each system is randomly generated, and planet surfaces are randomly generated. Use arrow keys to move ship and player around.</p>\n<p>Written in Golang using Ebiten. I tried to get a WebGL version but the planetary generation does not work nice in a browser :(. I have versions for Windows and MacOS. Ultimately this was fun because Ebiten is such a simple game library, and I ended up spending a lot of time writing my own viewports, collisions and scene system on top of building the game. It could definitely use some more polish but I\u2019m still proud of what I did in 48 hours. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T06:40:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10e3b9f04bffee1ad983a81d2abfa931.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ndrw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
