They challenged us to recreate a favorite mechanic of ours, but in a different dimensional perspective. Snake Pass is a 3d Platformer where you crawl around like a snake, winding through bamboo and buildings. I wanted to give that a try here on my favorite engine, Pico 8, minus one dimension.</p>\n<p>In this game you take control of a pink linear hero, Wurm, and must escape an\u00a0underground labyrinth. Control his head with the arrow keys and boost with Z when you need an extra kick. Squirm and wriggle around tight corners and ridges, thrash and slam, whatever it takes!</p>\n<p>Thanks to NeHe Gamedev for the great tutorial on rope physics. This project was 5 hours game, and 12 hours physics\u00a0engine. I really appreciate the expertise. You can find them here\u00a0http://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/rope_physics/17006/.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: This game was designed to be very difficult, I wish you the best of luck!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/832/832abe76537de3f8c92ee2ecad4b6776.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AdmiralEnto"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
