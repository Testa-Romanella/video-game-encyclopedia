This is a scifi epic based on my original lore that I have been developing over the course of a few years. This is my first time using Twine, as well as creating text based IF as a whole, so there may be minor errors here and there. If you can look past this however, I assure you this is an adventure that any scifi fan should enjoy!</p>\n<p>Synopsis: Humanity was called out of nowhere to serve a greater purpose, to fight in a war that seemingly had no effect on Earth. You were selected as one of the unlucky individuals to participate in this fight, at least that's how it was supposed to be. After what was supposed to be a simple scouting mission goes horribly wrong, you and the other 1500 passengers of a large transport ship crash on the distant (and uncharted) planet of Ryytal, a large, mountainous desert world. This seemingly uninhabited planet reveals itself to be the home to an unknown species who call themselves the Kazoth, a race deep within a longrunning civil war. You must embark on a journey spanning the course of many months, making loads of choices along the way that will inevitably determine not only the fates of you and your Fireteam, but the fate of the Kazoth, and Ryytal for generations to come.</p>\n<p>\u00a0TW: Heavy Violence, Xenophobia (between alien species), Swearing.</p>\n<p>Major updates will roll out for the release of each chapter, minor updates will come as\u00a0 frequently as I can make them, as they are needed.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone wishes to contribute to this project in any way, should that be through submitting art (character/landscape/scene), music, etc.\u00a0 Feel free to contact me directly\u00a0 through my public instagram\u00a0 @z.j.diam, or email zerkeous@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T16:13:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8ba6141b144ad103bea909904cdafe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Z.J.
