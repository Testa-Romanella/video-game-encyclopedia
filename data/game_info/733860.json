Once it reaches its last point it will cycle back to the start.</p>\n<p>Looking: The AI will switch to this state to look around for the player \u00a0at each\u00a0point\u00a0.</p>\n<p>Chasing: The AI will chase the player while the player is visible to it.</p>\n<p>Fighting: The AI will begin attacking the player with its ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>Frozen: The AI will stop where it is. This is essentially\u00a0its dead state.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Player mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>Movement:<br/>Simple movement controlled using standard\u00a0WASD input.<br/>Camera and player direction movement controlled by mouse input.<br/>Sprinting controlled by Left Shift button and tied to a limited rechargeable\u00a0sprint meter.<br/></p>\n<p>Equipping:<br/>The player can find and equip items by looking at them\u00a0and pressing the E key while being within range. Specifically there are 3 guns which can be found and\u00a0equipped.</p>\n<p>Simple attacks:<br/>Left mouse button will launch an animated sword attack while the sword is equipped.<br/>Left mouse button will fire a single projectile while any of the three guns is equipped.<br/>Right mouse button will active ADS (Aim Down Sights).</p>\n<p>Time slowing:<br/>The player is able to slow time via ADS. This slows the actual game time and thus both enemies and physics is slowed. The player can also switch between slow or regular time\u00a0manually with the F key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71e/71e5d943a1554908cc0dd3a112322d1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gabe Stott"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
