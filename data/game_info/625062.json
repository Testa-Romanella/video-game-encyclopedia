Far from it!</p>\n<p>This is my homage to Football Manager. But\u00a0I'm not a game developer and I had no idea how to code when I had my epiphany last year. Since then, I have spent every spare minute learning how to build a game using Unity in order to get to this stage but it is far from the finished article.</p>\n<p>Future updates will include:</p>\n<ul><li>Promotion and relegation and a full 10 Divisions</li><li>Midweek club dilemmas\u00a0to deal with (What would you do if your captain was caught having an affair with the left-back's wife?)</li><li>Domestic and European Cups</li><li>Greatly expanded buff system and upgrade options</li><li>More interaction with the chairman and manager</li><li>Completely new artwork</li></ul>\n<p>I'm also open to suggestions. Think you've got a killer feature I should add? Let me know about it.</p>\r\nIt Started With a Kick:\r\n<p>I've taken this bad boy about as far as I can on my own and if it is to see the light of day I am going to need some professional help.\u00a0 Which is expensive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you dig what I'm trying to do then you can support me by playing the demo and letting me know what you think. Then tell everyone about it.</p>\n<p>The demo is completely free to download but should you make a donation, all money raised will be used to speed up its development.</p>\n<p>If there is enough interest I aim to launch a Kickstarter campaign with the goal of raising the funds necessary to bring the full spectacle to market.</p>\n<p>And that's where it gets really exciting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Backers will be given the opportunity to send me some photos and I will turn them into characters for the game. That's right! You, your best mate and his wheelchair could be the stars of the show.</p>\n<p>Surely, the most socially inclusive game ever!\u00a0</p>\r\nDownload Instructions:\r\n<p>Hit the Download Button.
