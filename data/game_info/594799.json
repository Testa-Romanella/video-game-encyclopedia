All you have to do is\u00a0<strong>descend the level and find a door</strong>, which will lead you to a newly generated level- I won\u2019t lie, the way that works is a little sketchy, but it does work.\u00a0<strong>Chests give you coins</strong>\u00a0(which you can\u2019t actually do anything with!), and\u00a0<strong>sometimes they give you an extra heart</strong>.\r\n</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\nA, D or Left/Right Arrows - Move\r\nW or Up Arrow - jump (double and triple) + Climb Ladders\r\nSpace - fire magic wand\r\n\n<p>I originally wanted to have the ability to further increase the number of extra jumps you have. But it all got a bit tricky by the end, so decided to drop it. I also wanted different levels to have different colour palettes, but again\u2026 tricky! The levels are all procedurally generated, so there is sometimes a few issues with getting around unharmed, but there is always a path. Each time you complete a level, the bonus is that everything resets - including hearts.
