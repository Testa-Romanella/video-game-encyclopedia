Poor, defenseless animals \n      worldwide infected by the virus have been turned into flesh-eating, \n      hemoglobin-swilling terrors. Fortunately, the world has Alex. And, even \n      more coincidentally, he happens to be one of the world\u2019s foremost \n      biologists - specializing in viral mutation profiles and genetic \n      manipulation. Every studious biologist facing imminent global \n      annihilation needs a sweet ride, and Alex is no exception. He has \n      S.O.P.H.I.A., a shape-shifting, gas-guzzling, projectile-spewing paean \n      to destruction on four wheels. Things look grim, but with Alex and \n      S.O.P.H.I.A. on the case, the world just may have a chance this time.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69d/69dd2d04130b5d7e823c6c04a14f1e9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sunsoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
