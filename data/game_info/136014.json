One day everything changes and Cira has to figure out who she really is.\u00a0</p><p>P.S. a little tip for the looking for the amulet part. Try checking behind the trees in the forest ^_^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe5/fe53034ff71d6b0088628a253119f0b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sofelia"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
