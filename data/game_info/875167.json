This game was made in 0 hours.</p>\n<p>This game is based on Source Engine surfing mechanics. Do not hold W while surfing or else you will fall off. Hold D and make lateral mouse movements to adjust where you're headed. Look up Source Engine surfing tutorials for more info if you're confused.</p><p>Once you reach the end, you can start NG+ and increase your score. The game gets harder each time you finish.<br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately I ran out of time to fix the mouse unlock issue, to unlock your mouse keep the mouse still and press ESC twice<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T10:45:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea043f6df02f911332a348adad2a3558.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sap1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
