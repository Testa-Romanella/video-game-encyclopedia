But the difference here is that the pace steps up a gear - the game&#39;s developers have worked hard to deliver everything you thought the Quake series could deliver, and more. The idea is to develop your combat skills as you fight to escape the Arena Eternal, a chillingly atmospheric, cyber-gothic environment. While you can progress through the single-player mode to really hone your fighting skills, the real test comes when you take on your friends in the multiplayer option. Can you hold your own in the definitive, fast and furious Deathmatch? Or how about testing your mettle in the Elimination arena? With a variety of deadly weapons at your disposal, here&#39;s hoping survival will be yours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-02T16:12:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c0d/c0dd3aa2dfbd5701b8d4a0b744f41785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["id Software", "Bullfrog Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
