I plan on taking this mechanic into a first person archer game I am planning to develop. <br/>All models/particle effects used in this prototype were offered as part of the udemy course I enrolled in. All coding, UI and menus were created by me to flesh this prototype out a little bit. <br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>It's simple... just move the mouse to aim your bow, click the left mouse button to draw the bow, and release the left mouse button to send the arrow flying. Press space to start the game, and once time is up press space to play again. Escape is ues to pause/resume the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T02:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/429/429e9798ad5e63d5c8b8cc1af1862f22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Allus Interactive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
