Recruit Spies, Complete Missions, & Gain Independence", "name_original": "Operation Ares - A Revolution on Mars! Recruit Spies, Complete Missions, & Gain Independence", "description": "The year is 2379. Mars has been terraformed, and now its citizens can live openly on the surface. But while more people are arriving every day, a sickness festers in the heart of the new world: corruption runs rampant, and the people of Mars increasingly chafe under the yoke of Earth's control.<br/><br/>It's clear that something has to change, a massive shift in the future of Mars is brewing, but no one quite knows what that future will look like.<br/><br/>Into this power vacuum have risen several powerful factions, each with their own vision for what Mars could be. Some advocate working with the United Nations and solving Mars's problems diplomatically, others see Mars as the ultimate resource to be exploited by the growing transnational corporations of Earth, and still others envision a Martian utopia unlike anything in the history of the homeworld.<br/><br/>As the leader of one of Mars's most powerful factions you have the opportunity to decide the fate of an entire world. But rest assured: yours is not the only vision of a better tomorrow, and those who do not share your goals will be working to stop you at every turn.<br/><br/>Beginning from a single safehouse, you can recruit agents, train them, send them on missions, expand your influence into cities around the world, and transform your small operation into a global powerhouse. Then, when the time is right, begin your bid for power and try to take over Mars!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96e/96e7b07691bf38649073e2a7f2228d23_2NBmruJ.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alexander Winn"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Alexander Winn"], "esrb_rating": null}
