An old legend has it that there are two Virginity Gauntlets, with 6 Virginity Stones for each. The one who gets at least one Gauntlet will be imbued with an immense Chess Power and become close to invincible!! \ud83d\ude0e<br/><br/>That is what the Black King did. That is what our Main Hero did not know of. When he got to the Chess Top and fought the Black King, the latter had to use the \u2018Gauntlet Cumming\u2019 skill and one of the Gauntlets exploded. A burst so strong threw our Hero down to the very Chess Bottom. The blown-up Gauntlet was given to the Hero, and the 6 Virginity Stones were lost across the Universe. That is how the Gauntlet Cumming works according to the Legend (or simply to the chessopedia).<br/><br/>Now the Hero has to find all the 6 Virginity Stones and recompose his Virginity Gauntlet, then get to the Chess Top and do battle with the Black King! \ud83d\ude0e<br/><br/>Idle Chess Grandmaster - a parody game.<br/><br/>\ud83d\udd25 GAME FEATURES: \ud83d\udd25<br/><br/>\u2605 SIMPLE GAMEPLAY!
