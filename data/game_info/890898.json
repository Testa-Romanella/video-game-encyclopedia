I was a little overambitious and wasn't able to fully implement all the features I wanted to but I'm happy with what I was able to accomplish. The game follows the limitation of using only 4 colors (and plays with this by using different opacity and lighting to give the illusion of more color shades, all while sticking to the same actual hex-color number). It also follows the extra theme of \"Keep it Away\" by A. being a a game where the enemies are trying to keep you away from your goal and B. the central mechanic being the Repulsor Wave, which keeps your enemies away from you and allows you to interact with objects.</p>\n\n<p>Everything was created by me, with the exception of the music, which is used under license by Dark Fantasy Studio.<br/></p>\n\n<p>THE GAME:</p>\n<p>You are a 1337 hacker, who's latest program was stolen and separated into individual data orbs. You must send your avatar into cyberspace to retrieve all of the data orbs, so that you can reconstruct your precious program!</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Use WSAD to move</p>\n<p>Use 'Space' to send out your repulsion blast!</p>\n<p>-Use your repulsion blast to push away enemies</p>\n<p>-The repulsion blast is needed to activate switches, and to activate the Data-Orbs at the end of each area</p>\n<p>-The repulsion blast is on a timer! When you see the little particle effect around your character, it's ready to be used again.</p>\n<p>Press 'ESC' to pause the game and bring up the pause menu<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T13:09:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6e/f6ea3230d9ad5f140bcaa67bdc4972d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SvenBTB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
