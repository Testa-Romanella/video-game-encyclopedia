But then he meets his \"senpai,\" a wise and experienced octopus who tells him that his mutations are actually superpowers, and that he should embrace them and use them to protect himself and others.\r\n </p>\n<p>As the octopus progresses through the game, he encounters various enemies, who drop crystals as they are defeated. Each time the octopus collects some of those crystals, he mutates further, gaining new and more powerful superpowers.</p>\n<p>As the game progresses, the octopus must use his growing arsenal of superpowers to defend himself and others from the invading enemies, and ultimately save the day.<br/><br/><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<p>Move - WASD<br/></p>\n<p>Close the Game - Alt + F4</p>\n<p><strong>Used Assets</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>Free <ul> <li><strong>Fishes And Underwater Environment Set (</strong> https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/fishes-and-underwater-environment-set-123678 )\r\n </li><li>Stylized 3D Gun ( https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/stylized-3d-gun-184995 )\r\n </li><li>Simple Gems ( https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/simple-gems-ultimate-animated-customizable-pack-73764 )\r\n </li><li>Ground Texture by textures.com</li></ul> </li><li>Paid </li><ul> <li>Monsters Ultimate Pack 02 Cute Series\r\n </li><li>Game Music:\u00a0RPG Battle Themes from Game Dev Market</li></ul> </ul>\n<p><strong>Created assets</strong></p>\n<p>The 2D avatars where created using MidJourney.<br/>The intro music is composed by myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T21:43:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b9a43969a69924b00963e2be2eddd55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["diadas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
