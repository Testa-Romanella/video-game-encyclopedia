They realise that they cannot go on living the way they do. You<em> (the hero) </em>then go on to fight and overcome the addictive hold of the internet.</p>\n<p>This is a game meant to help motivate people to improve their consumption online and lead a better life. It is a university project meant to reflect an experience from my own life.
