We touched it up and added to it for a while after the jam. It's still not finished (occasionally the objects washing into the house get stuck or miss their targets, making the game unfinishable) and I'd like to polish it up a bit more someday, but life got in the way so I figured I would just upload what we have so far for now. Regardless, I'm proud of what we made so far.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/acc0aa7277bc90989c8e041dcf15b7b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tegan Valo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
