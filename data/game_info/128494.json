Specifically the scene where Indiana takes the golden statue which starts a run-for-your-life scenario. This was the first game jam either of us took part in so please enjoy our game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press 'A' and 'D' to move left and right, 'Space' to jump, 'R' resets to title.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/133/13360aacaa23aa63b86cbebdeabb2998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wallace.Donegan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
