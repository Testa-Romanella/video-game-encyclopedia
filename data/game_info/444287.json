{"id": 444287, "slug": "escape-the-retro", "name": "Escape the Retro", "name_original": "Escape the Retro", "description": "<p>by: Katsiaryna Aliashkevich</p>\n<p>My game is centered around navigating and jumping to different platforms throughout a pixelated, vaporwave environment. The character is a fox and the goal is to \u201cescape the retro\u201d because the fox was transferred into a different dimension and is trying to return back home, but he has to complete 5 different levels first. My game is structured by an increase in difficulty as the player goes along each level. In each level after the first one, the player is able to die by falling off a platform or missing a jump, this will restart the current level where the player died from the beginning. In each level the player moves rightwards in order to jump over obstacles and reach the goal.</p>\n<p>My theme is \u2018retro\u2019, which is shown throughout the gameplay as well because my game takes inspiration from nostalgic, platform video games like Super Mario Bros, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Psycho Fox (whose main character is a fox as well). The color pallet of the art assets I used are pastel and neon shades of pink, purple, and blue. The player will interact with my game by using the -&gt; key to go right, the &lt;- key to go left, and the spacebar to jump. They will jump over obstacles and move across different platforms to reach the goal at the end of each level. In the couple of harder levels at the end, the player is faced with the challenge of moving dynamic game objects in a way where it helps the player progress along the level and reach the goal.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>2D Game Mechanics - Michael Baker</p>\n<p>Pixel Art Assets - Ansimuz</p>\n<p>Music- Ryan Little '70s TV'</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:38:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/058/05821c4d05a0121845ac9ce61720d7f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["cyberkatrina"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
