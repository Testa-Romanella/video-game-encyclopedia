An idea then began to germinate... a maze, and some\u00a0ghosts? Why not try a scrolling isometric Pac-Man?</p>\n<p>I'm still not sure if a full isometric game is possible (that's for\u00a0another day) but a scrolling flat one certainly is, and I'm really\u00a0pleased with\u00a0the results. It looks good, is fluid and responsive, and features\u00a0most of the aspects of the original - including the (slightly bugged)\u00a0A.I. and\u00a0attack patterns. Having a ghost as the main character means that\u00a0I've had to supplemented the concept of 'lives' for 'spirit' - I mean,\u00a0a ghost doesn't have a life, does it? - which introduces a slight twist\u00a0on how you play the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MicroMart</strong> - \"<em>Bob\u00a0Smith has done it again with another superb release for the ZX81.\u00a0This is a pacey, technically impressive, playable and addictive\u00a0high-quality release. This is, for now at least, the best game\u00a0for the monochrome 8-bit that I've ever played. I'm sure even Sir\u00a0Clive Sinclair would like this one</em>\"<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Oldschool Gaming</strong> - \"<em>It seems\u00a0pointless in making any grand claims to how good One Little Ghost is:\u00a0and saying that it's simply superb does not in anyway diminish Bob's\u00a0other games, nor does it trash those classic games such as J. K. Greye\u00a0Software's 3D Monstermaze, Don Priestly's excellent Mazogs or\u00a0Rocket-Man published by Software Farmhouse, to name but three. Simply\u00a0play it for yourself: take away the hardware and you still have a damn\u00a0good, fast, playable and most importantly fun game.</em>\" - 9/10</p>\n<p><strong>SirMorris (RWAP\u00a0ZX81 forums)</strong> - \"<em>This\u00a0game rocks more than a cross-channel ferry with a broken stabilizer</em>\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c6/1c6dd567976b00de9763ad38ffe0c726.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
