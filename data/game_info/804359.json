I'm still working on it, but this build is a complete game, is plenty playable, and is stable (although there are a few bugs to work out still). Please check it out and comment below! There's no sound or menus yet, but that's the sort of stuff I'll be getting to shortly. Right now I'm a team of 1: I do all of the programming, game design, level design, 3d modeling, and animation myself.<br/></p>\r\nControls: (keyboard)\r\n<p>Arrow Keys or WASD - move around</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>E - interact (pick up or put down stone, toggle switches)</p>\n<p>Backspace or Delete - Reset the level</p>\r\nControls: (gamepad)\r\n<p>Control stick : move around</p>\n<p>A (or the bottom button) - jump</p>\n<p>X (or the left/west button) - interact (pick up or put down stone, toggle switches)</p>\n<p>Select (or uhhh I dunno) - Reset the level<br/></p>\r\nCheats<p>F5 - Previous Level</p><p>F6 - Next Level<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T22:13:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdb6b6939072e03929167ca50f11fd91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jordan Orelli"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
