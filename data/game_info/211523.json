Coming on pretty well I think. Has four levels currently.</p>\n<p>Use mouse to move bat. Release ball with either Mouse Button - will release in</p>\n<p>direction of mouse button pressed. If you obtain fire power, use Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>to shoot. Because this is a demo, you can also press S to skip a level, and + &amp; -</p>\n<p>to change angle and velocity of ball. You can also swipe ball with bat to alter</p>\n<p>angle and speed of ball. Still a bit of work to do on this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c03/c037ba0823f09ae84fa5c5e28da77882.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bootlegger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
