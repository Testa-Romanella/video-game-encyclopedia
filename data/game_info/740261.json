This is accomplished by establishing vast, interstellar shipping lanes, and purchasing stock in the companies that control those trade routes. During the course of the game, stock appreciates in value as the shipping companies become larger. Also, smaller companies can be merged into larger ones, and stock in the smaller firm is converted into stock in the larger one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:45:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/82923070bd91673660af778121b258e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ricardo Menezes"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
