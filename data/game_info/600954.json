It's been months since you last saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together. <br/><br/>She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just the get-together that you need to reconnect. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing along an uninvited guest.<br/><br/>Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's about the only thing you share in common... <br/><br/>Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?<h3>The Cast:</h3><br/><br/><br/>Theo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to have a tight-knit group and doesn\u2019t open up to just anyone. She studies photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is your host for the weekend.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Lena is Theo\u2019s roommate\u2026 and replacement best friend. You don\u2019t know much about her, or even what she\u2019s studying. From what you\u2019ve seen on Friendex, Lena is a vibrant and outgoing person. She\u2019s always dyeing her hair different colours and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she enjoys hiking and playing piano.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally, renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea\u2026 until he started dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been annoying you... more than usual.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown. You don\u2019t remember much about her, or ever talking to her\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-29T21:42:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1af/1afc28ee66b314ef0fbda11e427c400b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 364, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Delphinium Interactive"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Delphinium Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
