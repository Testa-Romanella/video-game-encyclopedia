Those are the wings of\u00a0<strong>SPARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE\u00a9</strong>. Decide your own level of difficulty on a realtime basis in this modern, 1970s-arcade-style replay game about exploding, suicidal birds. The mechanics are simple: Spacebar culls a bird from the sky to come hurtling randomly toward the ground while you, Major Parasol, then use your running, jumping, and psychic parasol shooting abilities to repel these spooked, wing\u00e9d metaphors toward the source of your crippling depression: Supreme Alien Overlord, Mr. Jelly Toast. And don't get hit by these birds! If you can win, the game will grant you an option to restart with a slightly more coked-out, pissed-off, tricky-to-hit Mr. Jelly Toast. Ad infinitum.</p>\n<p>Play over and over to win the high score in our online leaderboards!</p>\n<p>Check us out on our website at www.softresetworks.com!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/337/337c9e60146987cad8b69f2864a53bdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SOFTRESET"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
