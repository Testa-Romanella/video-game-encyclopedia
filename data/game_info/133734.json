{"id": 133734, "slug": "cubicle-2", "name": "Cubicle", "name_original": "Cubicle", "description": "<p><em>A game about work, life and your part in the machine</em><br/></p><p>Cubicle is an puzzle game, whose level progression uses changing mechanics, puzzle styles and aesthetics to create an emotional journey. The aesthetic and narrative theme in this game is that of an employee of some vague megacorporation, struggling with the juxtaposition of their importance as a cog in an essential machine, and the generic anonymity that goes with it. The player's job is to arrange cubes to direct a laser beam from point to point. The player's greater role in the corporate is never clearly explained, or how their solutions relate the whole, but we are reassured it is VERY important.</p>Contributors<p>Carlos Melo - Programming, Design and Art</p><p>Alexander Hockley - Design and Art </p><p>John Blinco and Taras Spahic - Audio<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d1651378626a6ef863cb2a6ea726a1e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CarlosStuff"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
