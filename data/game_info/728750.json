Waumland in particular was hospitable to \u00e9migr\u00e9s plotting the restoration of the monarchy, and agents of the young republic's secret service worked hard to infiltrate and disrupt their plots as best they could.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0You are a young man from Westmark, sent to infiltrate\u00a0the household of Lady Daphne as a gentleman's companion to her son Maxim. But Respite House turns out to be a web of secrets and lies -- one you'll have to navigate on your own.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>12,000 words of interactive fiction (roughly 4,000 per playthrough)</li><li>Nine possible endings, and many more dynamic paths through the story.\u00a0</li><li>A unique Edwardian-tinged setting</li></ul>\n<p><strong>State of the project:\u00a0</strong><em>Respite House</em> is still in development. It should allow you to play through a story from beginning to end, but I'm also hoping to add more scenes and choices to explore the characters and the world more thoroughly. Feedback is appreciated -- I'd love to hear what you think of the story, as well as any typos or bugs you encounter.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Testing: SW, TL, ZSL</p>\n<p>Image:\u00a0https://www.pikist.com/free-photo-slkid; graphic design: DA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T09:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f84a031efb57227237935f6ae7b1d1d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["breakinthesun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
