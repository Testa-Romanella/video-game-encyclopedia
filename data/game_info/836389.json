Despite already armed with an extremely accurate Assualt rifle, you take those two weapons and proceed on your mission, praying to return alive once completed the mission.<br/><br/>This is a short game designed by me to test fps mechanics I programmed such as ammo pickups, enemy AI that spots and attacks you on sight, torch use, and level design to make the village as Belavable and creepy as possible.<br/><br/>There is one easter egg in this game that references one of my characters from my previous games on my itch.io page, so good hunting!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T14:23:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28c22d888313350886d751c51b0d1b2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 335, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam House"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
