For example, Liu et al (2013) reported enhanced social and communication skills for individuals with autism after completion of a workplace intervention. Tasks of the intervention included completing office-related jobs such as clerical work, office cleaning or goods packaging,\u00a0 with debriefing sessions at the end of day. The debriefing sessions are implemented as a way of helping participants understand social behaviours they encountered throughout the day. \u201cEnd of day\u201d reflection as part of the game mirrors the debriefing concept and intends to assist the player in understanding appropriate social behaviours\u00a0 in common office environments.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Individuals with autism also typically demonstrate hypersensitivity which is defined as over responsiveness to sensory stimulation (Black et al., 2017). Therefore, hypersensitivity was taken into account by allowing the player to have control of sound and light.</p>\n<p>References\u00a0</p>\n<p>Black, K. R., Stevenson, R. A., Segers, M., Ncube, B.
