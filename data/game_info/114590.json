I like this game, but developers used starter content, which gave Unity and game don't look very good. Almost 1 year ago I had idea to remake this game in UE4. My goal is make something new and interesting. I won't make same as original Unity game, where werewolf teleports - I want to make this game more realistic with good graphics. More interesting that I will add story and more features, for example, play as werewolf, random map generator, etc.</p>\n<p>I already have builds, but I don't make general gameplay yet. When I make map, werewolf AI, characters, multiplayer, localization and normal optimization, I will upload here as early access and after that game will receive \"Alpha\" version. I need to learn and learn Blueprints and more - some stuff I know, but I am learning now.</p><p><strong>Support development</strong> - Patreon</p>\n<p><strong>Follow project here:<br/></strong><strong>Discord Server\u00a0/\u00a0Tumblr\u00a0/\u00a0VK Group\u00a0/\u00a0Gamejolt\u00a0/\u00a0Trello</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5f/d5f7cd0092c30483e7ed0e9d7b221d02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MineProLike"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
