What is the best way to eliminate zombies? of course it is killing them.\u00a0<br/>Turn your finger into a gun and kill as much as zombies you can. You can turn your finger into a pistol, a sniper or a mini-gun. Also you can choose a cool effect to point out your finger gun.\u00a0<br/>Finger guns can be upgraded by two categories: shooting timeout and damage. You can also increase your health to kill more zombies with your favourite finger gun.\u00a0<br/>As you kill more zombies they become more stronger and it becomes a challenge to kill them. Also stronger zombies will damage your health-bar more than previous weak zombies did. Upgrade your finger gun and show them who is the boss!\u00a0<br/>Enjoy your time by killing as much as zombies with your favourite finger gun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59ee1805e62ca4660b54323b0e78e142.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["binnat_musayev"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
