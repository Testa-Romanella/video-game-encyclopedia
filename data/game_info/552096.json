It is far from finished at the moment, but we hope that you can still find some sort of entertainment playing this casual space-themed shooting game. It doesn't offer a lot gameplay-wise yet, but that's mostly because we kind of miscalculated the deadline. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>The player is a rocket which can only move on the x-axis and your goal is to defeat the boss by shooting it up with simple projectiles that deal a lot less damage than the powerful fireball which you have available every 10 seconds. The game fits the jam's theme in the way that you can collect coins, but contrary to the mechanics  of most videogames involving coins, you shouldn't collect too many of them, as your rocket fuel (representing your health) slowly decreases, and the factor by which it drops off rises with the number of coins collected. If you don't manage to defeat the boss in time, your fuel will run out and you will not be accelerated anymore (which basically means you are dead and have to start over). But coins are still worth something: you can upgrade your stats using them. In this case, the theme \"Less is More\" applies in the way that you can't just get as many coins as possible, but rather think about the balance between loss of fuel and the number of coins you want to carry. \u00a0To help you with that, you can drop off all your coins at once when the fuel decreasing factor is just too high.There are also green ghosts randomly spawning in every few seconds, and you have to decide if you will try to move towards their x position to shoot them up and make them drop a fuel canister which you can utilize to restore some of that vital fuel, or will you let them pass by without the risk of being hit and losing a chunk of health (fuel). As you hit the boss, his health will decrease and when he's  out of HP he will be terminated.</p>\n<p>New Added Feature (50 mins before jam-deadline): The cloud now summons an entity that is bouncing around and that will damage you. You have to dodge it or else you will lose some fuel - this change made the game more playable.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Keybinds:</strong></p>\n<p>A, D - move horizontally;</p>\n<p>MB1 (Left-Click) - Fire (default);</p>\n<p>MB2 (Right-Click) - Fire (alternative -&gt; Fireball);</p>\n<p>C - throw off all coins you currently have (and reset the fuel decrease factor) - careful: you will lose the score that you gained by possessing the coins.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Particularities:</strong></p>\n<p>- Target Res: 1920x1080 (otherwise UI might not be scaled properly, sorry about that)<br/></p>\n<p>- All assets were created by our team (see credits below) from scratch this week.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Team Members</strong><strong> / Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p>- nux (coding + game management + game design + physics implementation)<br/>- Reisfressi (coding + game management + game design + physics)</p>\n<p>- Alex (music + sound design)<br/></p>\n<p> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/777/777c22b15dc64128f24b8e892911630b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nux"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
