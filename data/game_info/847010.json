I\u00a0worked on this game with a few good buddies I met long ago in\u00a0college who are also interested in making little games in their free time.\u00a0We call ourselves \"Duck Dudes Games\" and we hope you enjoy our first completed project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T11:47:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23c/23c819be1991b374bd6652e242d82b37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iamdudeman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
