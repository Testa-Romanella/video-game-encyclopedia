As Microsoft did not compete with Nintendo in portable gaming, Rare was free to develop Banjo Pilot for the Game Boy Advance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92e/92e337e00c28d1c5dad1d6fe180dc5b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["THQ"], "esrb_rating": null}
