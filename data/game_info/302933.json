Capture all hexagon tiles to complete the level. A hexagon is captured if it is filled with the same color as your ship, blue. If a tile has a number it means you need to go over it multiple times. If a tile has a letter, for example \u201cB\u201d you need to capture tile with the \u201cA\u201d first. Green hexxes transports you to another teleport on the board. To make it even more challenging there are enemy ships which are trying to block you movement. Step on an enemy to neutralize their captured tiles. If you are surrounded by captured tiles than your stuck and you better restart the level to retry again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d190542737c9080419d4da1d827d6b9.jpg", "website": "http://www.nannings.nz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tuwi Michael Nannings"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NanningsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
