So I decided to dust it off, recompile it for x64 devices and re-release it.<br/></p>\n<p>It's a two button fighting game, with a one hit KO. You can play vs the computer, a second local player, or over a network. You might get the odd desync on network games, but I'm pretty sure it worked pretty well when I last tried it.<br/></p>\n<p>Default controls are Left Shift and Left Control for the left player, and Right Shift and Right Control for the right player. XInput controllers are also supported.<br/></p>\n<p>On Linux, there's a bug which prevents the process from shutting down. I haven't been able to work out what is causing this, so bear that in mind.</p>\n<p>Built using Allegro 5 and enet, with OpenGameArt assets, and music with permission from naildown55 on NewGrounds<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T05:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/131c55531457237c308ffb6e69da2020.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["pmprog"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
