Every time you moves from one card to another, that number inside the arrow drops. When the number reaches zero, your inventory slots will be filled with a hungry card.</p>\n<p>In this case, you need to eat a food card to get rid of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks to a lot of great people who provide invaluable suggestions: Ricky,\u00a0David &amp; Alan.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d3/2d37b26de1bd0370573550ede482c527.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CDBD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
