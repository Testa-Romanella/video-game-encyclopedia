{"id": 706719, "slug": "elves-present-pass-panic", "name": "ELVES: Present Pass Panic", "name_original": "ELVES: Present Pass Panic", "description": "<p><strong>Help Santa's elves sort the presents before Christmas.<br/><br/>A game that can be peaceful, or total chaos.<br/><br/>Play alone or with two players at one keyboard.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Recommended to play with the sound turned on.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:<br/></p>\n\n<p>Control the two elves using the keyboard. The elf on the left is controlled using WASD keys. The elf on the right is controlled using the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Place COAL in the FIREPLACE</p>\n<p>Place BROKEN PRESENTS in the GARBAGE.</p>\n<p>SEND BACK any presents that need it using the BOTTOM CONVEYOR BELTS.</p>\n<p>Place ALL OTHER presents in the SLEIGH.</p>\n<p>The elves will always announce whether a present is broken or needs to be sent back just after it is placed on the middle conveyor belts.</p>\n<p>On low difficulties, an icon will indicate whether a present is good, broken, or needs to be sent back, but as the difficulty rises the length of time that this icon displays will shrink until no icons display at all.</p>\n<p>Difficulty will slowly rise as you play, but you will get a huge score multiplier based on your STARTING difficulty.</p>\n<p>A long string of successfully sorted presents creates a combo, which increases the score value of each present and can also bring you back if you are losing.</p>\n<p>Santa's reaction at the bottom of the screen indicates how close you are to losing.</p>\n<p>Don't drop presents, but dropped coal is okay.<br/></p>\n<p><em>A note from the creator: This game is dedicated to my sister Candace. ELVES was designed based on another game from a distant memory that was part of a CD-ROM I had as a child (I think I either got it in a cereal box or as a gift from my grandma). I used to scour the internet to see if I could find this game each year. Eventually, I got tired of searching and decided to just re-make the game myself. <br/></em></p>\n<p><em>If anyone knows the name of the game that ELVES was based on, or where to find it or footage of it, please contact me!
