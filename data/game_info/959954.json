The style of the novel is not accidental, it comes from the opportunity to tell the story more simply and easily, as well as to participate in it. Indeed, the key to a detective story is to solve the mystery that the game sets out. In One Eleven you will be able to communicate with all the characters, and make your own decisions during the course of the story. They may often be wrong and result in the death of the protagonist.<br/><br/><strong>The story</strong> begins with the main character reflecting on his hermit-like and bleak lifestyle. As a result, he decides to make a change, to get out of his house and meet some new people. He gets the chance to attend an unusual speed-dating event, not in the city centre, but at a local landmark on the city outskirts. The location is a beautiful lighthouse located in a rocky area. It usually attracts tourists, but it's springtime, known for its stormy weather.<br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br/><ul><li> Unique design of characters and environment<br/></li><li> Dark and Depression atmosphere<br/></li><li> Gorgeous OST<br/></li><li> Twisted storylines with unusual twists<br/></li><li> Replayability<br/></li><li> No verbiage<br/></li><li> Romance with everyone<br/></li><li> Full game will have more then 500.000 words</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-24T13:22:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8dac9470e92cb07104947850b260b176.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 414, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vivilatvia"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ViviLatvia"], "esrb_rating": null}
