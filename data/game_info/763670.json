Manage the guildhall's finances and send out expeditions to quell rising unrest in a myriad of randomly generated dungeons. Build your reputation by training adventurers to take on ever increasing challenges and replace those who failed before.</p>\n<p>Years ago tensions between the guild and the local populace came to a climax as each took up arms against the other. Ultimately the guild was outnumbered and crushed almost entirely, leaving them as but a shred of their former glory. Among the people a circle arose with the intent to exercise control over the guild. As part of this reform guildhalls were forced to adopt the then propagandized term of \"GuildMestar\" as official titles to remind them of their past failures. Though under strict regulation there are those who still operate against the Calrian Accord, and quieter yet are those who whisper of a coming second great war.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Trading</li></ul>\n<p>Buy and sell items managing your margins to stay in business.
