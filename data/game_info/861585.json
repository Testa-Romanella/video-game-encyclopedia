Mostly whilst I was ill.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>DELUXE FEATURES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game features three exciting modes:-</p>\n<p>ESCAPE MISSION - the standard mode. \u00a0Shoot things, don't die, the usual kind of vertical shooting stuff. You only get one life, though. Takes about 5 minutes to clear if you know what you are doing, but as always with these things, that's the trick.</p>\n<p>ENDURANCE - An infinite mode in which the game will throw wave after wave of ships at you. It's randomised using a fixed seed, so it should theoretically prove the same experience every time for those of you who want to challenge just how far you can go.</p>\n<p>DAILY - Like Endurance, but it uses the current date as part of the random number generation. Also you can only play each day once. Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>D-Pad - Move your ship one of eight luxurious directions.</p>\n<p>B - Hold this down to shoot. Probably a good idea.</p>\n<p>A - Hold this down to make your ship move a little slower. Useful for navigating tricky situations!</p><p>No crank controls on this one, though I guess that means it'll work perfectly fine on the Playdate emulator for those who don't have the hardware but feel like downloading the SDK anyway.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T07:51:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/234/234cfce1df797c6f586c571c2e82c1b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["digikerot"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
