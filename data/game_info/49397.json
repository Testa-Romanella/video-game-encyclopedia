{"id": 49397, "slug": "coinski", "name": "Coinski", "name_original": "Coinski", "description": "Coinski is a great new puzzle game where you and your opponent drop coins into a maze and try to get as many out as possible. The rules are simple but the depth is surprising!<br/><br/>At first, this game even feels a bit daunting. Winning seems a matter of luck.<br/><br/>Then, you find clever ways to improve your chances. You win more bets with friends, and improve your high scores when playing alone.<br/><br/>HOW IT WORKS<br/><br/>Each turn, you drop a coin into one of the maze's columns. Your do that in such a way that the most coins will come out during your own turns (and the least during your opponent's).<br/><br/>The coins are held back by gates that react to passing coins. This means that you can use your coin to get other coins out during your turn, making them yours. But watch out that they don't get stuck themselves, ready for your opponent to snatch it!<br/><br/>SAME-SCREEN WITH FRIENDS VERSION: A SMART BETTING GAME<br/><br/>\u200bIn the multiplayer mode, each player bets 15 coins. One coin may stand for anything: honor, a drink, marbles, kisses, money, jewelry, real estate... you decide!<br/><br/>Your aim is to win back as many coins as possible. Once you win back your 15 coins, you also get the ones left in the pot and the maze.<br/><br/>SOLO VERSION: ABOUT BRAINS AND DETERMINATION<br/><br/>In the solo version, the app is your opponent and it is not smart at all. Luck decides in which column it throws the coins.<br/><br/>But it's not easy. When your opponent has won a certain amount of coins, your game is over.<br/><br/>In the beginning, at level 1, this amount is just 1! But at level 2 it will be 2, and so on. The amount equals your player level. This means that along with your level, your high scores will increase.<br/><br/>To increase your level, the average score of your last ten scores needs to be above a certain number that depends on your level. This means that all of your game scores count, including the bad ones. Of course, the number is chosen so that reaching the next level gets slightly harder as your player level increases.<br/><br/>Have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc82ff4edd88b0f4ec7f01cf868cee0b.jpg", "website": "http://coinski.weebly.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Geert Docter"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Geert Docter"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
