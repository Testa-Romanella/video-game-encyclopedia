You and Alie will be interacting and learning about each other. Simple as that. You will not be in any danger. You are free to leave at any time and will always be welcome to return.<br/>Keep in mind that this is an experiment, which means this is being observed. Just try to be on reasonably good behavior during your visits, please.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>A simple visual novel made in a single month for NaNoRenO 2019.
