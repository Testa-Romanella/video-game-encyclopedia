It is derived from Alquerque and was popular amongst sailors.<br/> <br/>Play it with a friend next to you or against the computer enemy. </p>\r\nRules\r\n<p> The goal is to remove all of opponent's stones. You can capture one by moving one of your own stones towards or away from an opponent's stone.\u00a0</p>\n<p> You can move a stone one field along the lines. If a capturing move is possible, it is obligatory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is possible to chain capture moves. But then you may not touch the same field twice and your piece has to change its direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p> To learn it, it is propably the best to start with the 3x3 version, available via the settings. The game always shows you what moves are currently possible, so I hope it is easy enough to understand the rules by playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dd/4dd8d8bb6342707493b7e5e3ef2128b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["honeyMead"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
