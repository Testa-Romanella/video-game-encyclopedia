With Duck\" in Japan) was originally released in February 1987 for the EXTRAGAME 20-in-1 home console on magnetic tape cassette. Due to extremely limited (even for 1987) graphics, sound, and game play it was taken off of the market in March 1987 and promptly disposed of in a Wyoming landfill.</p>\n<p>The game was miraculously rediscovered in March 2017 and is currently the intellectual property of Extra Future.</p>\n\n<p>@philnelson / extrafuture.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0b7d422789444006b1d16a06ba7604e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Phil Nelson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
