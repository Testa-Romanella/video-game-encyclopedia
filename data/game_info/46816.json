Support your swarm by spitting deadly globs of Neurotoxin at the enemy horde, or if things get really out of hand, unleash the \"Bio-Nuke\".<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your minions all <strong>control themselves</strong>, which leaves you free to focus on the macro-strategy. Which types of minions will you create? How and when will you upgrade them? <strong>Mutate your eggs, spawn your swarm, spit some goop, and watch the chaos of battle.</strong>\ud83d\udc1c FEATURING \ud83d\udc1c<br/><ul><li>Swarm Queen is inspired by real-life insects. This is what a war between ant colonies might look like IN SPACE! (Technically, we are also in space.)<br/></li><li>Over 17* different beautifully hideous minions to murder the enemy with, from electricity-shooting shell-covered beasts, to flying bat-like bomb-carriers. (*Over 17 means 18.)<br/></li><li>Dozens of levels, with 2 difficulty settings, and multiple degrees of completion, including bonus \"challenge levels\" to test yourself with after you've unlocked all the units.<br/></li><li>In most games about swarms of alien monsters, they get mowed down by stupid humans. Swarm Queen is guaranteed 100% human free. ALL ALIENS ALL THE TIME.<br/></li><li>Made by 1 dude over like 4 years. (This has nothing to do with the gameplay, I just thought you should know.)<br/></li><li>Swarm Queen contains a 100% scientifically accurate depiction of Jupiter's moon Europa, including all of the alien life. No, it's not covered in a mile of ice. NASA is lying to you. The Earth is flat. The president is a reptilian. The universe is a hologram.
