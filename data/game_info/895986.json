Playing the game based on the initial timer, which can be 5, 10 or 15 minutes, grants an opportunity to catch new pokemons, grow them and be ready to participate in the contest.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are four significant zones\u2014Fire Cave, where you will find fire pokemons. In the town, a variety of normal ones plus the initial three elements, and on the island, water pokemons. In the Woods, you may find grass ones.\r\n</p>\n<p>Four special pokemon are in the zones for you to catch and have an advantage in the tournament.\r\n</p>\n<p>Be wise with your time because you need to train your pokemons fast enough to prepare for the tournament.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Move the character using WASD\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>X - to open inventory</p>\n<p>Z - to interact with characters in the game<br/></p>\n<p>Esc -\u00a0 to pause the game</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Credits &amp; Citations</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Thanks to</p>\n<p>All academic material covered over the course of Game Engines III - GAME3023 - Academic Year 2022-2023</p>\n<p>Joss Moo-Young.

Some of the characters may look very similar with subtle differences because they were or are still a work in progress. Rather than picking which version is better, I've included all of them.</p>\n<p>A few of the tiles in the tileset were meant to be played as an animation starting with the tile on the left moving to the right. This includes the flowers and water tiles. Attack animations are 159px by 159px going from top to bottom. They are short animations meant to be played on loop for a few seconds. Some are meant to be played slow and some are meant to be played fast.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuxemon Set 1</strong></p>\n<p>For full details, see https://wiki.tuxemon.org/index.php?title=Set_1</p>\n<p>Contributions by Spalding004, Leo, Catch Challenger, josepharaoh99, tamashihoshi, Cavalcadeur, Sanglorian, Levaine, DevilDman, Chickenshowman, Serpexnessie, extyrannomon, Bonny John, Lanea Zimmerman, Magic-Purple-Hermit, MTC-Studio, NikitaKurylev, ReallyDarkandWindie, Redshrike, Royaba, TacoBot, Aviculor, CharlesGabriel, Harris Fagotto, Kyu, Mike Bramson, moritz_gunz, Mysterynoodler, ProfessorGreen, rsg167, Smiley-Fakemon, Superpowers Asset Packs, TheSplashDragon, treetrnk, Yalyn and ShadowApex</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 licensed</p>\n<p><strong>GB Pokemon Complete Sound</strong></p>\n<p>GameBoy \"Pok\u00e9mon\" no Sound ga Marugoto Haitte, Asoberu CD<br/>Pokemon - Game Boy Pokemon Sound Complete Set, Play CD\r\n</p>\n<p>Platforms:\u00a0GB<br/>Year:\u00a0<strong>1997</strong><br/>Catalog Number:\u00a0<strong>TGCS-384</strong><br/>Published by: MEDIA FACTORY, INC.\r\n</p>\n<p>==============================================================</p>\n<ul><li>GitHub Link :\u00a0GAME3023-FinalProject</li><li>Youtube Video:\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:05:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/78089323c5962de31910675e60e99d49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AsperSarras&MiguelPenalvr"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
