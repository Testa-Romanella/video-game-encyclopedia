{"id": 315298, "slug": "greedy-hp", "name": "Greedy HP", "name_original": "Greedy HP", "description": "<p>Greedy HP is a top down arena game. Four players will fight to control the hearts. The player with the highest life (number of hearts in his corner) wins the game when the timer ends. For this to happen players will need to think offensively and defensively : they can dash-stun, throw hearts they've picked, and buy powerups on the outer conveyor belt with their life. Be aware of the central zone for special events !</p>\n<p>Plays best with 4 XBOX360/XBOXONE controllers.</p>\n<p>Made by :</p>\n<ul><li>John Barry - 2D art</li><li>Roxanne Corbeil - programming</li><li>James Delson - 2D art</li><li>Mathieu Fontaine - design/music</li><li>Arthur Fournier - programming</li><li>Linna Lim - programming</li><li>Marianne Nobert - 2D art</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/745/7452a03dcec61c98d0393757d0b3a132.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["bouergh", "Hoshikko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
