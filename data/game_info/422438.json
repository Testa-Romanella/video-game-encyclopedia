{"id": 422438, "slug": "sentence-bridge-builder", "name": "Sentence Bridge Builder", "name_original": "Sentence Bridge Builder", "description": "<p>entence building games from Making English Fun.<br/><br/>This is a fun and educational sentence building game designed for those who need practice on sentence construction in English. It is designed for all ages.<br/><br/>There are two games of 4 levels inside the application that increase in difficultly. The first is a missing word game, that simply requires you to slide the correct word into the right place to build the bridge and let your animal cross it.<br/><br/>The second is the more challenging game, you have to put all the word in the sentence in the correct order. If you make a mistake you restart the level!<br/><br/>Both the games start with simple three word sentences and move up to four, five and eventually six words ( though they are a squeeze to get on the screen!!!!) So they become more challenging as you progress.<br/><br/>If you get one wrong it resets the level, but not the whole game.<br/><br/>This is designed for teachers and educators to use in schools and learning centres or for home educators to practice English sentences with their students in an interactive and self directed way and while playing sentence games.<br/>Of the two games the missing word one is the easier, however it does throw up some words that could be used in the sentence as well, so you will still have to think about it :)<br/><br/>It fits in well with our other learning apps which include Sentence Scramble, Swing and slide phonics and Word Hop and pop. I hope you find them useful!<br/>Please leave us a comment or email us at info@makingenglishfun.com<br/><br/>Thank you and good luck with your studies!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T04:45:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f4/8f4840955bd31147d262f570bd197c84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Making English Fun"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
