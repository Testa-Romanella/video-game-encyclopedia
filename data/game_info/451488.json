Therefore only floawing in a positive direction.</p>\n<p>Or is it?</p>\n<p>With this little game I wanted to explore the possibility to control the time in a solar system, aka change the position of the planets around their sun in both directions. The goal is to let the planets survive for as long as possible. Dangerous comets are crossing the path of the system and threaten to destroy the fragile planets! However, not all dangerous things are just evil:\u00a0the green comets also bring life to the solar system (aka enhance the point multiplier).</p><p>Credits for the free assets used:</p><p>GameLoopMusic: https://freesound.org/s/368575/\u00a0 ,Made by Sirkoto51<br/></p><p>BackgroundMusic: https://freesound.org/s/368575/\u00a0 ,Made by GregorQuendel</p><p>Sound:\u00a0DistantExplosion2: https://freesound.org/s/86292/\u00a0 ,Made by sandyrb</p><p>Original Textures of planets: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/</p><p>Tool for creating the Skybox: Spacescape</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8f/a8f57ec3d01965543251410c1fc35e0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LisaWillig"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
