I wanted to give Ren'py a try and also wanted a project where I was forced to create assets, in this case images and writing, instead of coding. I find that usually after I've coded a system I get bored and I wanted to get some practice that would help build discipline. I had a busy month but I think it went well.</p>\n<p>My art skills are pretty poor so creating art for a visual novel was a real challenge. Early on I had this idea to create collage images from anything I could find in the public domain. I didn't spend as much time on this as I had hoped because just finding usable images was pretty time consuming, but I had a lot of fun putting them together. The eggplant jar image is courtesy of Cody Mace.</p>\n<p>This is an idea I can see revisiting but spending a bit more time on. The game takes about 15 minutes to play through but it is mostly reading. You can play in browser or download builds for Windows, Linux or Mac. Let me know if you find any bugs or spelling mistakes.</p>\n<p>I hope you get some enjoyment out of it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T08:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c710ccce628f1453232f1115b41beb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["tamewhale"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
