This game is more complex than my other visual scripting game Awesome Platformer. There are loads of new features that are added to my game like swords, arrows, enemies, dungeons, keys, doors, buttons, lava, fireballs, hearts, coins, shops and many more! But both Awesome Action RPG and Awesome Platformer were fun to make e.g. both games had cool shaders, camera screen shake, post-processing, animations, UI elements, and both games were really fun to play and it had that satisfy feeling. Everything was built to make it easier for me to comprehend in a way I can develop my visual scripting skills as a game developer. Furthermore, I developed the player movement and physics; enemy AI with an attack logic and health system and creating my map using Tilemap. I want to create more games to become a Games Developer and visual scripting makes it easier for me to create games from start to finish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T07:53:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69a/69a84ef5584440063c3be6fbec4fc734.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
