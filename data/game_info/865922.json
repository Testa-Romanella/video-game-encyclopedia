It contains 102 levels , was released in August 2010 and<em>\u00a0includes a series of alphabet puzzles.</em></p>\n<p>Here are\u00a0Microban I,\u00a0Microban II\u00a0and\u00a0Microban III.</p>\n<p>Mobile-friendly version/source code:\u00a0https://auroriax.github.io/PuzzleScript/play.html?p=bdb674a685de8f1c7a1e7e16da83...</p>\n<p>If a puzzle doesn't display properly, use the fullscreen or the link above. You might need to zoom-in/out sometimes to get consistant sizes. Also, some puzzles are simply too big to be displayed on mobile, I'm sorry about that.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Goal: Put every yellow circle on one of the targets.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Arrow keys to move\r\n</p>\n<p>- Z to undo\r\n</p>\n<p>- R to restart\r\n</p>\n<p>- ESC to access the level select\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's Microban?</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>The\u00a0Microban collection is good for beginners and children. Most of the puzzles are small and illustrate a particular concept.\u00a0More experienced players should also find them interesting, since there is a wide variety and many can be surprisingly tricky at first glance.\r\nMicroban sets\u00a0contain levels of the following types:\r\n1. Small levels which demonstrate one or two concepts.\r\n2. Levels which are easier than most Sasquatch levels.\r\n3. Levels which are smaller and simpler versions of other levels.\r\n4. Large levels which contain only one object. Use the mouse to place the object on its destination, then sit back and watch the computer do all the work. These are I-154, I-155, II-132, II-133, II-134, II-135, III-101, IV-101, IV-102.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>(Taken from D.
