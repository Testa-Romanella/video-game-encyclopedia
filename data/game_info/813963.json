A trap on a tile is an ambush, a trap on a mosnter is a counterattack.\r\n</p>\n<p>-Cooperation Sigils: Allows two monsters to merge together to form a larger more powerful monster, with higher power and health.\r\n</p>\n<p>The target is to elimnate the opponent's king which is a level 4 monster with 8000 health points, special abilities and high mobility.\r\n</p>\n<p>The base level one units are the pawn, knight, rook and bishop and they move as you'd expect them to move in chess, as long as they are at level 1. Also keep in mind that you can get field bonuses based on the monster type and the type of terrain the monster is standing over, try to capitalize on these bonuses to ensure your victory.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Queen in this game is a cooperation monster, that can only be formed using a Cooperation Sigil with a rook and a bishop.\r\n</p>\n<p>Cooperation sigils are used to generate level 2 monsters by combining two level 1 monsters, and can generate level 3 monsters, by combining two level 2 monsters.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each level two monster, has a new special ability, it also combines the movement abilities of the two level 1 chess pieces forming the new monster.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each level three monster has more than one special ability, it also combines the movement abilities of the two level 2 chess pieces forming the new monster.\r\n</p>\n<p>Though you can't just merge any monster with any monster, you need to keep an eye out on the monster types being merged together.\r\n</p>\n<p>Only the following combinations of monsters are possible:\r\n</p>\n<p>Ice\t\u00a0 + Fire\u00a0 = Magic\r\n</p>\n<p>Fire\u00a0 + Magic = Stone\r\n</p>\n<p>Magic + Stone = Ice\r\n</p>\n<p>Stone + Ice \u00a0 = Fire\r\n</p>\n<p>Experiment with the possible combinations to discover the special abilities and have fun. ^-^\r\n</p>\n<p>Finally on the unfortunate event that a monster dies on the field it is retruned to the player's hand.\r\n</p>\n<p>Be cautious and decide wisely on how you intend to spend your sigils, after all your opponent is cunning and will use traps, special abilities and field bonuses on you.\r\n</p>\n<p>Assuming that you're lucky and get two similar sigils, that will count as four sigils of said type. If you're even more lucky and get three similar sigils, that will count as nine sigils of said type.
