Don't forget: You're one big family.<br/><br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Oh, by the way.\u00a0As Tom left the company because it's \"ToO AbUSiVe\" and \"a HuMaN RiGhTs ViOlAtiOn\" (such a loser) it's your turn now to help your great family deliver the project due by tomorrow. As families go through hard times every now and then please don't hold back in any way to make sure this project meets the finish line.<br/><br/>I'm sure you got this! And don't forget how lucky you are that we picked you. Would be a shame if you had to leave us already.\u00a0Anyway, good luck!</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Lovingly, Boss.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Man, you should've picked another Job. Well\u00a0that's what it is now, fella!<br/>Let me at least break it to you:<br/></p>\n<p>You are a producer at a company and your team has a milestone at 6am. Help your Team members to stay awake, by either slapping them awake or serving some hot, nice coffee. It can be that your Team members need some paperwork, go to the printer and print the right stuff for them. And sometimes one of the computers need some hands-on work. Get to them before they slow your progress. Move around with WASD and Interact with stuff by holding Left Mouse Button.</p>\n<p>This game was made during\u00a0BansJam2022 (https://itch.io/jam/beansjam-22)<br/><strong>Topic:</strong> We need to stay awake</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:<br/></strong>Put in truly useless Bees<br/>Make every Sound with your Mouth<br/>And \"Secrets\"\u00a0but we didn't get that in sadly (see Banner)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/><strong>Gameplay Programming: </strong>Gustav Mehner<br/><strong>System Programming &amp; Music: </strong>Alex Martin<br/><strong>Unity &amp; Level Design:</strong> Daniel\u00a0Schneider<br/><strong>Art:\u00a0</strong>Bich\u00a0Hang Pham, Niro Dil Hossain-M\u00fcller, Tina\u00a0Raab<br/><strong>Sound\u00a0Design:\u00a0</strong>Julien\u00a0Schillinger<br/><strong>Cover Art:</strong> Anna W\u00e4gner</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T06:33:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e09/e0946e97eeb4e6316fae0e2fe3a87b03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PandaBee Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
