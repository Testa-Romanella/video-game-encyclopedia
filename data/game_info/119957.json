Using stealth and puzzle solving, you must reach your victim to quench your thirst for blood.</p>\n<p>All the staples of puzzle-platforming are here, running, jumping, and shifting crates, but when the world reflected in the mirror subtly differs from reality you can shift between the two freely to take advantage. Can't reach a ledge? Grab the block from the other world to help. A platform that is only available in one world? Switch worlds in mid-jump.</p>\n<p>This game is still in progress having been created for the Mirror Game Jam.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>At this early stage, \u00a0an Xbox controller is recommended, as it is the only input with icons for the in-game tutorial prompts, but keyboard is also supported with the following mapping:</p>\n<p><strong>Menu</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Enter</strong> - Select option</li><li><strong>W &amp; S</strong> - Move selection up and down</li></ul>\n<p><strong>In-Game</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>A &amp; D</strong> - Move left and right</li><li><strong>W</strong> - Jump</li><li><strong>S</strong> - Drop through platform</li><li><strong>E</strong> - Interact / Pick up</li><li><strong>Q</strong> - Switch between worlds</li><li><strong>Esc</strong> - Back to menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fff/fff8e350056bc8f7bf0b71ff7375e51e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Never Rest Studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
