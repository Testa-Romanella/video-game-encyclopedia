Test your resolve and prove your devotion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Use your lantern to light the way, and protect from the covetous shadow as you race through the city to its highest point. Culminating in your goal of a final eternal rendezvous before the night envelopes the land.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY TIPS:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Hold shift to sprint and build momentum.</p>\n<p>2. Time your double jumps to effectively clear gaps with your momentum.</p>\n<p>3. Look for scuffed walls as indicators of wall run areas. You can jump at a glancing angle onto these walls and run across them.</p>\n<p>4. Wall running resets your double jump! Use consecutive wall runs and jump combos!</p>\n<p>5. Additional powers are granted once your lantern is obtained! Press R for a slight time rewind. Press Q for a forward facing dash.</p>\n<p>6. If you are struck by a shadow, you will return to a waypoint! If they are blocking your path, use your abilities to get around them, OR press F to scare them away for a short duration with your lantern.</p>\n<p>7. Lantern abilities have limited charges, be sure to look for vials around the world to replenish these charges.</p>\n\n<p><em>Credits:\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Level Design &amp; Shader Design: John Diasparra\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Lantern Artwork: Alan Hourmand\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Programming: Matt Prangley &amp; Jake Ross Monster\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>AI: Jake Ross Character\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>SFX: Matt Prangley Monster\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>SFX: Josh Painter\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>All Music and SFX used are Royalty Free / Open Licens</em>e</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:59:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77c/77c9c8fc3a18543316ff883f96dfcc0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Montreseur"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
