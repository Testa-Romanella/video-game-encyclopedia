Although he went through some drastic changes, he is still able to work and do his duty.</p>\n<p>For the project, I was using Maya, Zbrush and Substance Painter. Mainly Maya, as it was mostly hard surface modelling and uv's. Zbrush for details. Substance for texturing.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend to read the document for it, as it provides more in-depth of development and I am pretty sure some will find it interesting and amusing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db5/db583cf9b1e96c72989d1383777f6221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaRkSoUrC3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
