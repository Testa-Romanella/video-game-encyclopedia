The theme of the game jam is having a 64x64 effective game resolution.

Run your character up the screen through procedurally generated scenery, eating berries as you go. Avoid the mud pits if you don't want to get stuck! Be sure your smile doesn't droop with hunger... if you get too hungry, you'll die! Your score is recorded by how many blocks away from the start point you die. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Movement is done with arrow keys<br/>Hit \"N\" to start a new random run<br/>Hit \"R\" to restart the same run<br/>Hit \"Q\" to quit the game</p>\n<p><strong>Features I might add before the jam ends:</strong><br/>Sounds while eating, dying, getting stuck in mud<br/>Command to save screenshot of game (for showing high score)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0f/a0fdb02b6c154bcdf73c7164721f2003.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Aitocir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
