This is my first completed proof of concept!</p>\n\n<p>In the full game, you will take on the roll of\u00a0 Theodore Carter. A post XXXXX war detective. After looking into a recent patricide, Theodore glimpses behind the vale and realizes his life and choices may not be his own. Cosmic and body horror ensues.</p>\n<p>In this proof of concept is NOT canonical\u00a0to the final project, but instead is\u00a0 short story containing\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0the same character . It is an example of the basic gameplay as well as art style. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/HelmetNotIncluded</p>\n<p>Twitter: @SodaHelmet</p>\n<p>Music By:\u00a0 \u00a0James Quanvie\u00a0 and\u00a0 \u00a0J.
