After the collapse of Great Pyramid of Giza, the game\u2019s protagonist Lara Croft is presumed dead. Her three friends come together on her funeral and tell three stories about her recent adventures that did not appear in previous games. These three stories take the most of the game\u2019s playtime. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay shares many similarities with Last Revelation. The levels in the game incorporate platforming, puzzle solving and fighting enemies. Lara can use many different weapons in combat such as her iconic double pistols with infinite ammo, submachine guns, shotguns, harpoon guns. The new item to the series is grappling gun. It can fire grappling hook that clings on certain surfaces and produces a rope that can be used to swing across rooms and get over pits. <br />\nPlatforming sequences require Lara to use different acrobatic moves like somersaults, walking the tightrope, swinging on horizontal bars. Some levels take place underwater where a player must use weapons and items different from the other parts of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-02T17:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79ccb0bf14ae8a14b582b9e4cb47b3d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.35, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 161, "owned": 1956, "beaten": 100, "toplay": 30, "dropped": 48, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 137, "suggestions_count": 842, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 137, "platforms": ["Dreamcast", "Classic Macintosh", "PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Core Design"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Aspyr", "Eidos Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
