Bubba, a seafaring countryman finds himself stranded in the middle of the ocean, and it is up to you to keep him alive. How do you do that? It is simple. Use your grappling gun 3000 to swing dip dive and shoot from seagull to seagull, all while staying out of the shark infested waters haunting you from below. In this cute, quirky, and fairly relaxed/easy little game you must collect beach balls that are floating about in order to score points. What do you do with the beach balls you may ask?\u00a0 Well, uhhh.... Enjoy their ever increasing presence.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/521fbdbb2bcafadb07eb0ab8ca4bc984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HuddyBuddyGreatness"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
