Please don't play this if you get motion sick easily, and try to have fun. This experience is really hard given the nature of the play perspective, so I'm sorry if it feels unplayable. This was created only to see if it\u00a0could be done, not if it should be done. This experience only offers 5 holes for now, but I'm sure after the first one or two, you won't want to play anymore :)</p>\n\n<p>I also plan to release the game as a downloadable on SideQuest and maybe even AppLab if\u00a0I can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T13:38:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ed/2ed2a7316466af1d1d3eeb49f9d32419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Cameron Aron"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
