I used Tiled Map Editorand Unity Engine to make this \"game\", I got my artwork from the Liberated Pixel Cup and followed a tutorial on youtube by a chipper-chap named rm2kdev. Stick with me and follow my progress because it'll more than likely be hilarious, if not just really boring. Yes it is just a sprite that you can walk around a map, and yes I know the collision detection has failed me! Hope you like it...... if you do, you need to seriously up your expectations from games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45d/45dd8c19b98b211f1cf4b6fe59cf27c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Harryevolution"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
