We get together every week for a 8-hours jam to experiment on the new opportunities in educational resources and collective intelligence.</p>\n<p>This time we wanted to work on OPINIONS vs FACTS: nothing is more annoying in a constructive debate than someone submitting opinions as facts [that is an opinion], so we figured we'd do a simple game to practice on the difference. You will learn, or you will keep on dying in it [that is a fact].\r\n</p>\n<p>We made this game in one \"8 hours Jam\" so please be gentle. We hope you enjoy it!\r\n</p>\n<p>Made by Delphin Casado, Lola El Koubi, Tom Rivi\u00e8re and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Urien.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:01:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/671369b64f13fb534bb48b6887b90ac4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Savvy"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
