{"id": 112550, "slug": "rod-rocket", "name": "Rod Rocket", "name_original": "Rod Rocket", "description": "<p>A thrust-style side scrolling rocket game. Harvest materials, fire rockets, trade goods, add to the level, fight the bad guys and save up to buy the most bad-ass ship you can.<br/></p><p>This game is in a deep alpha state, and currently exists as a platform to show what this game is like to play. There is not a lot of level to play as of it and is somewhat \"pointless\", but is indeed fun to play around in.</p><p>If you have <em>any</em> feedback whatsoever I would be appreciative. The game is in a very early stage and am still in the air a bit about what direction I want to take it, a lot will come down to what works, what doesn't, and not needlessly making the game more complicated than it needs to be.</p><p>The suggestion of $2 is simply to help me develop this game. I don't have a lot of spare money to put into this or buying tools, and every bit helps, even simply as motivation to keep going. Thankyou</p><p>@rodtronics</p><p>rodtronics.tumblr.com </p><p>rodtronicsnz@gmail.com</p><p>UPDATE 11/1/14</p><p>Added tutorial level to begin with. Does away with most of what the readme tells you. Still the same though</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23e/23e34640266260ab280e0a81ee4866e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rodtronics"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
