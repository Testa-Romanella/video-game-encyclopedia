Unfortunately for Yasha, this includes serving spirits who want food and those who want trouble.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Ramen Rush</em> challenges players to cook, prepare, and serve six types of fantastical ramen to patrons of the Night Market. Only by serving customers quickly and accurately can you obtain a 5-star ranking and elevate your ramen dreams to perfection.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\r\nThe Dinner Rush is Here\u2026\r\n<ul><li>Create the perfect dish for every customer\u2019s order\r\n</li><li>Serve every patron who enters into the open-air restaurant\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Beware the unintended consequences of your decisions\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nCome and Get it!\r\n<p><em>Ramen Rush</em> was made in collaboration with the Creative Media and Digital Culture Program (CMDC Program) at Washington State University Vancouver using Unity.
