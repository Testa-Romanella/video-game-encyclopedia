Alas, a few years ago, I should have said \"my universe\": but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things.</p>\n<p>In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that there should be anything of what you call a \"solid\" kind; but I dare say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described them. On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least so as to distinguish one figure from another. Nothing was visible, nor could be visible, to us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of this I will speedily demonstrate.</p>\n<p>Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning over it, look down upon it. It will appear a circle.</p>\n<p>But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and more oval to your view, and at last when you have placed your eye exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually a Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all, and will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.</p>\n<p>When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar experiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant island or coast lying on the horizon. The far-off land may have bays, forelands, angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a distance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright upon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light and shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.</p>\n<p>Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other acquaintances comes toward us in Flatland. As there is neither sun with us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none of the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland. If our friend comes closer to us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it becomes smaller: but still he looks like a straight line; be he a Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will\u2014a straight Line he looks and nothing else.<br/><br/>This will have taken you more time to read this text than to play the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:19:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acb/acb6378b45cfbc4ede324eba2203aede.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aestheticoffailure"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
