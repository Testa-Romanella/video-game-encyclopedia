Unfortunately your weapon systems are malfunctioning! The only systems you have are your Amplifiers and your Time Distortion Drive (aka your Rewinder)!</p>\n<p>&gt;Amplify the bullets by passing them through your Amplifier beams to give them enough strength to penetrate the enemy shields.\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;Dodge the enemy bullets until your Rewind ability is available.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>&gt;Use Rewind to turn the tables on the enemy, sending their (hopefully amplified) bullets back at them! Be sure to dodge the returning bullets too!</p>\n<p>Enjoy! :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T05:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3a/f3a4bfcb744d97d5b2342e7681790f8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["moocow17@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
