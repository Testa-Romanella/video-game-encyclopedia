I decided to go with one of my favorite games which thrives off it\u2019s 3D design, Dishonored. I only had a week, so I decided to focus on a small but important aspect of the game, which is its traversal. I spent the most time on getting the teleportation mechanic called, Blink, to work just right. I spent a lot less time trying to fix the problems I had encountered when I would flip a sprite and mess up it\u2019s hit box code. So, the final product is more of a test in if stealth traversal and level design from Dishonored could be done in a 2D environment, and not combat or hit box detection. The rewarding part about watching people playtest this prototype was to see them find their own emergent solutions to the puzzles I presented to them. If I were to dive back into this, I would make the guards stationary (so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the weird flipping sprite bull#$% that drove me nuts) and I would also perfect the level design. This week I walked away with a better understanding of what to focus on and cut when creating a prototype of a larger experience, keeping in mind questions such as: is it a test of a system, is it a thematic test, is it a broad stress test of a larger idea, where can I cut corners, where can\u2019t I cut corners, etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T03:59:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f62/f62a237f2c82ab26871fdfcf2e82bd94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John Wanamaker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
