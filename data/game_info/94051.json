It is with this philosophy in mind that we approach game development, and we believe that our work stands out as a result.</p>\n<p>We have already released several commercial adventure games, with more titles in active development.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Facebook<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Website</strong></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d0/7d075ed849bea73ddc50e7cbfe1afd64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unimatrix Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
