Unfortunately his companions have left him. They grew greedy and sought after a mysterious burning ball that lay above the surface of rock. Such a silly thing that. How could there possibly be a surface to his home? He has tunnels going in, out up and down. never once did he encounter such a thing. And how could someone hang a burning ball in the sky anyway? the string would break and the fire would run out eventually... Little goblin thought this to be a very silly expedition. So he stayed behind. And now you, have found little goblin. Will you care for him?</p><p>This is my first unity project and I have only just learnt c# so I would like for people to test it and throw ideas at me for my next project which will hopefully be a full functional game. The \"?\" and status bar do not work and are there purely for decoration. Maybe I'll revisit it and add in those features.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:59:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3e/b3ebfde68a17e9ad6b31a5c87f615ac7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["aRPGenius"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
