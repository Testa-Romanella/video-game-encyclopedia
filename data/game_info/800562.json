There are various buildings to capture to both produce different units and to increase your income, in addition to eight total units plus three powers and two types of defences. Combat works based on higher tier units having higher chances to win with defences either providing defence until tanks (artillery) or bombers (rocket artillery). Lastly, there are various scenarios and settings that can changed to provide different experiences along with two player hotseat multiplayer.</p><p>Note to browser players: While playable within Itch.io, the game works best when downloaded due to issues with how Itch.io displays the background of games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T14:36:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/4596d0ff7dedc00217fa1aa60d648693.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LDGamingExpress"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
