{"id": 7955, "slug": "morphopolis", "name": "Morphopolis", "name_original": "Morphopolis", "description": "<p>Morphopolis is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Dan Walters. </p>\n<h3>Setting and art-style</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in the real-life setting and based on the theme of insect microcosm. The player controls an aphid grub during the process of metamorphosis. The game lets the player explore familiar environments from the insect\u2019s perspective. Morphopolis is completely hand-drawn, uses bright colors and contrast pallet. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay is very reminiscent of other point-and0click adventures. The developer mentions Machinarium and Tiny Bang Story as the main sources of inspiration.<br />\nThe primary goal of the game is to achieve the spawning ground. To do so, you must travel to various locations like gardens and fields. Each level consists of two parts. First, you have to find several items on the screen, such as eggs, flowers, parts of other insects. Then you solve a quick puzzle a get another list of items that you have to collect. <br />\nThe gameplay itself, however, is not the focal point of Morphopolis, but rather a reason to explore unique environments. The game is centered on its art-style and unusual setting, making it mostly an aesthetic experience.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2013-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:09:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df7314ef7e0ab35865c1584b120bd630.jpeg", "website": "http://mcro.org/morphopolis", "rating": 2.55, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 62, "owned": 1339, "beaten": 44, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 17}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 100, "suggestions_count": 373, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 101, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dan Walters", "Daniel Walters", "Dan  Walters", "Ceri Williams", "Micro Macro Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Dan Walters", "Daniel Walters", "Dan  Walters"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
