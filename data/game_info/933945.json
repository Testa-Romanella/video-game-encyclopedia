If possible it is encouraged that you leave a comment suggesting a future update and a honest review on how this update is. Comments will be looked at and used for\u00a0future updates. I will try to get out one update a week starting now (2/9/2023) and\u00a0continuing for ten weeks. Controls are currently WASD to move arrow keys to turn. When you have the required amount of wood you can click the button for the type of tile you wish to place and where (adjacent\u00a0to your current boat) you would like to place it. If these controls are not to your liking please leave a comment with your desired control method and I will\u00a0try to implement it.</p>\n<p>graphics by:\u00a0Georges \"TRaK\" Grondin, Bart K., Proxy Games, JCW</p>\n<p>sound by:\u00a0jasinski,\u00a0<strong>Varkalandar,\u00a0Thimras</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T13:52:45", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DoubleIgames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
