Currently, only a short demo of it is available. However, depending on how the demo is received, I may end up making it a full short game.</p>\n<p>This is my first time making a game ever, so all sorts of feedback is welcome!</p>\n<p>The game follows the Life and Times of an Unfortunate Assassin. You were at\u00a0 your friend\u00a0Stitchy's party when the Crow Clan arrived, tearing your friend to bits without hesitation or\u00a0following up on their RSVP beforehand. Now it's up to you to travel the lands, collecting pieces of your old friend to put him back together again as well as taking down the Crow Clan throughout your Journey.\u00a0</p><p>So get out there and KICK SOME CROW!</p>\n\n<p>(You cannot kill the boss in this version.\u00a0Some assets are reskins of Nuclear Throne Enemies, however, this won't be the case if the game gets enough support for an Official release. The Boss is using The Oasis Boss sprite and YOU CURRENTLY CANNOT KILL THE BOSS.
