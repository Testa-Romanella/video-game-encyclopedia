The game is about the wonders of nano technology. The time to play may vary, but from beginning to end and taking my time I get about 8.5 minutes. I\u2019ll admit there isn\u2019t so much to look at, but it quickly became apparent that graphics which be a huge task for this game.</p>\n<p>I would say that the hardest part about making the game was balance. A very small tweak in this game leads to very large outcomes just by its nature, and I know I haven\u2019t tweaked it fully to my liking just yet. Also I\u2019ve tried to space out story in such a way that things are accumulating in the background and that the next story beat is never too far away. I will say that this was both my most and my least ambitious game jam game so far. While it has no audio and graphics like I usually have, the writing and gameplay balance ended up taking a ton of time.</p>\n<p>Made with unity, all coded from scratch except for using Text Mesh Pro from the asset store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09d/09df83e74f836e84ba8d71db14b4b259.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kleinzach"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
