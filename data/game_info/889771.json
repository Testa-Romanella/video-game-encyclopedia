More like it was turned into a two player game.\u00a0The commands for player 2 are:</p>\n<p>i for jump, k for down, j for left, L for right, q for special, w for kick, e for punch, r for parry, and 1 for gun eye. B, N, and M should be\u00a0up.</p>\n<p>The pilot command still works, though you won't be able to do much with the secondary player. The second player doesn't support the AI, due to the custom controls.</p>\n<p>Also, this is untested on Windows.</p><p>Recommended to plug in another keyboard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T21:00:00", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["eY"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
