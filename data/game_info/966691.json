The biggest feature of \"Listen\" is that there is no screen display throughout the process, and everything is entered by the keyboard and mouse movement.<br/>Listen is a first-person shooter where the goal is to destroy all enemy units. Navigate the map with limited sound prompts and power-ups to find and destroy enemy units while battling them without being destroyed by them. Or play a 1v1 blind typing battle with friends, find each other's location in the map, and hide your location.<br/>Playing Listen tests listening and patience, calmly facing the game, and then facing life calmly.<br/>The important thing is said three times: there is no interface! No interface! No interface!<br/>Any questions and comments should be sent to 3187501391@qq.com<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T04:33:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19d/19da320079de7116fddc3e131bc13739.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PENG MIN"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["PENG MIN"], "esrb_rating": null}
