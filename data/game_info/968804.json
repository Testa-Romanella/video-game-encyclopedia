Your goal is to fetch all the stars from the level and go to the next one. For that, you have one ally, yourself. When moving throught the enemies area, a trail will be created behind you, don't let the enemies hit it (or youself) or you will start again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you reach a border, the zone will be split and a safe area will be created if no enemies are inside. Use this area to make the level easier to avoid getting hit by enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game requires skill, patience and problem solving. You can either force the level to do it quickly but also take your time and put safe area to make the level easier. The right balance between these two will help you reach the top score of the leaderboard !<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo summarize, Neon Dash Tales is a snake like puzzle-retry game that mixes reactivity with logic !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T19:24:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/557d153d5a97eeb8fffedf1277f886c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Badger Games", "Julien Devillars"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Badger Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
