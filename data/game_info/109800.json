Tonight at midnight your master decided to have a bit of fun...with your life on the line!</p><p>Fire your spells quickly and destroy 100 beasts to please the Lich Lord so you can survive another day.</p><p>I made Lich Lordz for the Ludum Dare 31 Jam. It's a rough little demo but fully playable. See if you can survive the creeping hordes of eye spiders and cyclopean skulls!</p><p>Robert Mostyn did the chiptune soundtrack.
