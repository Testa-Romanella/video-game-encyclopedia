{"id": 114316, "slug": "partner", "name": "partner", "name_original": "partner", "description": "<p>This is a game I made for my wife for our 14th anniversary. It's very personal, and all the intricacies of the design express my love for her.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is simply to reach the end of the journey (the top). The journey can be dangerous. As you bump into or investigate the people on the path, you may find their true colors come out and they become even more dangerous. However, if one of them could be a partner, perhaps you could ease each other's journeys. Or, you could avoid all interaction and complete the journey solo. There is much meaning in that as well.</p>\n<p>I hope you will also find meaning in this game and share it with your loved ones. &lt;3</p>\n<p>Attributions:</p>\n<p>Font: Amatic Regular, found here: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/amatic?q%5Bterm...</p>\n<p>Music: \"July\" by Kai Engel, found here: http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kai_Engel/Chapte...</p>\n<p>Sounds:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Ambient woodland noises: \"MAFX001 wind robin blackbird 01.wav\", found in part of the GDC 2016 archive found here: http://www.sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc2016/</li><li>Buzzer: \"buzzer [ harpsichord-ish].flac\" (edited by me) by Timbre, found here: https://www.freesound.org/people/Timbre/sounds/192...</li><li>Chime: \"Chime sound\" by jgreer, found here: https://www.freesound.org/people/jgreer/sounds/333...</li><li>Pairing crescendo: \"03490 film crescendos happy shine.wav\" (edited by me) by Robinhood76, found here: http://www.freesound.org/people/Robinhood76/sounds...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b2ac673d8546ca90c85c5d5958a70f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["paracatgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
