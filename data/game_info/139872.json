Maybe it's your job to save cats... Maybe it's your cat... I really dunno. But you have a lazer blaster and a keenness towards jumping, so you must (well... \"must\" is a strong word... \"might\"?) save a kitty from a planet full of dangerous aliens. Well... It's a small planet... And their isn't THAT many aliens... but I think you get the point.</p>Controls:<p>left and right arrow keys to walk, up key to jump and \"x\" to shoot.<br/><br/></p>Instructions:<p>Search for the lost kitty! Find power-ups that might help. Pew-pew-pew!<br/><br/></p>Other notes:<p><em>This was a game I wrote to learn HTML5 and javascript.<br/>A homage to my favorite portable console and second favorite game for that console from my childhood.<br/><br/>This game has also been ported to Android, from javascript to the android SDK. Save a Kitty on GooglePlay<br/><br/>Feel free to look through the source, but it was my first try as JavaScript, so don't expect anything pretty.<br/><br/><strong>Software used:</strong><br/>Milkytracker for music and sfx.<br/>GraphicsGale for graphics.<br/>NotePad++ for coding.<br/><br/>Created by Kevin \"Kalisme\" Laherty</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78ab4605e101299b82523406ac26443e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kalisme"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
