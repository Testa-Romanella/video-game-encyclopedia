Your slimes will deliver the required resources, but be careful! If too many of the wrong resources are delivered at once, the rocket will explode. In order to balance the slimes\u2019 delivery rates, build walls to manage their pathing. The more convoluted the path, the longer it will take for slimes to make their deliveries. If you miscalculate, you might have to murder on of your loyal minions\u00a0to save the project. </p>\n<p>Controls: Click and drag to place walls. Right click and drag to delete walls. Tap slimes to smush them. Middle Mouse Button to pan camera.
