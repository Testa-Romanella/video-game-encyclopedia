I figured it would work because the game could get fairly chaotic fairly quick. The relative part is because gravity is relative to the player, not the world. This is my second game ever, so don't expect a masterpiece. I ran out of inputs so there isn't a pause option sorry :) Just refresh the page to return to the menu. After 5 attempts to get the physics right, I present the version available now that should work.</p>\n<p>Also I think the credits are broken.</p>\n<p>And motion sickness warning.</p><p>And yes, everything is just Unity's default sprites.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:37:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6b/b6bc076d501eafdcff6dcf4949a59e43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Konnner"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
