Museum \n      guard-turned entrepreneur Larry Daley discovers that his favorite \n      exhibits, and some of his best friends, from New York\u2019s Natural History \n      Museum are being shipped off to the archives at the Smithsonian. Larry \n      gets a distress call from the miniature cowboy, Jedediah, reporting that \n      Egyptian ruler Kahmunrah and a trio of heinous henchmen \u2013 namely Ivan \n      the Terrible, Napoleon and Al Capone \u2013 are plotting to take over the \n      museum, then the world. Speeding to the nation\u2019s capitol, Larry is \n      clearly in over his head. But with some impressive new pals, including \n      the irrepressible Amelia Earhart, along with familiar friends Teddy \n      Roosevelt and Octavius, Larry will stop at nothing to restore the \n      Smithsonian before dawn.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/1743a8626a07388cc697962445aaff39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 452, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS", "Wii"], "developers": ["Pipeworks Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Majesco Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
