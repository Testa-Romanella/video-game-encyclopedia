So always be mindful of what you put on the tray and make sure you can match it off quickly or letting it clog the flow up a bit is worth it if it is blocking your access to many other tiles underneath.<br/><br/>Contact us:<br/>If you have any problems or questions, please contact us, it's a pleasure to help you.<br/><br/>Website: http://www.starsprite.com<br/><br/>Thanks", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d2/9d2909a3e43d1eb4a99a2b24063b27cf_KKEjgVm.jpg", "website": "http://starsprite.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Li Xueke"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Li Xueke"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
