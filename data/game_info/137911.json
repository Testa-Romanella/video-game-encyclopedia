I'm creating a new setting, a full plot, and have a clear project view for the future. My previous project on itch.io, Strafe Suit: Skybeast, has been postponed, sorry, for reasons listed on its page, but if you were curious what I like to do, check it out.</p><p>Anyway. Goals include twelve stages, ten bosses, eight weapons, and a variety of mobs to fight through. It won't be very long, but it WILL be VERY hard. I still use a bullet hell school of thought, and approach my encounter design with that philosophy in mind</p><p>Some music pieces I've composed for this piece are availible for download. I may retouch them before release. At some point I intend to release a soundtrack album as well.</p><p>Other pages:</p><p>Facebook:</p><p> https://www.facebook.com/Project-Rock-590048271147...</p><p>My DeviantArt (Has some work on it)</p><p>http://the-drake-raider.deviantart.com/ <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67625f2347eb97523e9a569835ff365.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheDrakeRaider"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
