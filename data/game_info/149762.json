The main goal was to remake a game using Construct 2 and to make it as similar as possible to the original. As we didn't have an artist in our team, we chose to recreate an easy-looking game.</p><p>Certainly, we attempted to do some things differently. As the game couldn't exceed 100 programming events, we created a history that would last for all the levels that we created. Also, we've added a great deal of challenges at each level.</p><p>You can also play our game at Scirra Arcade where it has already achieved 237 plays by the time I'm writing this!</p><p>Thank you for playing it! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f0/7f0d041c50df740c44ba93230496a9cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Palups", "NatalieV"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
