{"id": 575538, "slug": "project-tamarack", "name": "Project Tamarack", "name_original": "Project Tamarack", "description": "<p>Project Tamarack is a fast paced card swiping game where you take on a different deck in each level. As you swipe the cards into the correct zones you build up your combo meter for each color and each card is worth more and more points, but watch out take to long or swipe a card into the wrong zone and your combos will break, you may even lose one of your three lives. Make it through the deck without losing all your lives and try to claim a new high score!<br/><br/>Follow development of Project Tamarack on my YouTube Channel.<br/>Latest DevLog<br/>Or on Twitter at\u00a0https://twitter.com/The_T_Pearson<br/><br/>Version 0.1 is the first public demo and includes 8 levels for you to try out. I'll be adding more levels with each release. My goal is to release a new version at least every other week. While in development I\u00a0won't be charging for the game, I'll make a new post when the final game is release and that will be a couple of bucks.<br/><br/>Project Tamarack can be controlled with the mouse (Recommended) or with the arrow keys.\u00a0<br/><br/>If you encounter any bugs please leave a comment. I'll add each one to my Trello board and try to address them before the next release.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T06:14:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d7/1d7c6801ad79a22c37cfd7bb30cd28be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThorsHand11"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
