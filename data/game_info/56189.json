She then joins Phoenix, an almost as brutal counter-terrorism organization to seek revenge.</p>\n<p>The game's minimal marketing efforts dealt mainly with the attractive appearance of its computer-generated heroine. Compared unfavorably to the more established Metal Gear and Splinter Cell series, Rogue Ops was largely panned by critics and did not fare well commercially.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e677550fb05f832b9aa90ff9662b3375.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox", "GameCube", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Bits Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["KEMCO"], "esrb_rating": null}
