In this point and click\u00a0game there are 2 modes, Rapid and memory.</p>\n<p>In Rapid you click a button as fast as you can. Your points scale with how long you survive, so don't let more than 5 spawn in! The modifier just shows you how many frames are in between each button spawning, and it will slowly shrink until it reaches 15.</p>\n<p>In Memory you have 30 seconds to get as many points as you can by clicking the buttons in the same order they spawned in! If you take your time, you'll get 1 point for a correct guess, but this modifier rewards fast and precise gameplay.\u00a0 Clicking anything that isn't the right button will reduce the modifier by 1, and if you keep messing up you might get nothing, or lose points when you get\u00a0the correct answer!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>-Pressing escape in the start screen will erase that modes High score.</p>\n<p>-Clicking the left button on your mouse is how you interact in game.</p>\n\n\n<p>I had less time than I would have liked to finish this game but I'm happy with how it turned out. I also saw that\u00a0the Jam Theme was parkour far to late to start over lol so I just went with it. Please enjoy, and let me know what your High score was in the comments! Mine are 104 in Rapid, and 115 in Memory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T17:49:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efddc51522c90eab0394e620deca80a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicyoZ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
