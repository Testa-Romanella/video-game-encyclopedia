There will be a base A1200/CD32 version that doesn't require any fast RAM, but that will happen closer to the end of the game's development. It's the same demo I released last year but with <strong>many </strong>improvements, the password section included, etc.</p>\n<p>You can find out a bit more about this project at my site.. As well as on MixelsLab Twitch where I stream the game's development frequently!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T09:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c28/c28da2008f75b6e3bea3f196180b206b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MixelsLab"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
