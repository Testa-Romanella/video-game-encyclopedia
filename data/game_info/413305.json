Have fun!</p>\n<p>(Fun fact, I had to leave on vacation during this development week, so this was made in a single day. You can make simple games fairly quickly if you have an idea to run with!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:49:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e50/e50ed456a261a28b12366f5112ea34d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["daners88"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
