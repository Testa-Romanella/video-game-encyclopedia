{"id": 28156, "slug": "tacoma", "name": "Tacoma", "name_original": "Tacoma", "description": "<p>Tacoma is an indie adventure game developed by Fullbright.</p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>In 2088, corporations heavily influence social life. These conglomerates are the pioneers of space travel, space construction, and artificial intelligence development. The economy promoting loyalty to a select corporation is established. </p>\n<p>The game takes place on the Tacoma space station. It serves as a transit hub between Earth and a resort built upon Moon. Amy Ferrier is hired by the corporation that operates the station to investigate a mysterious chain of events occurred on the station and to retrieve a processing module from the station&#39;s artificial intelligence. Upon her arrival, Amy begins to find out what&#39;s going on using Tacoma&#39;s augmented reality system.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Tacoma focuses on the in-game world&#39;s exploration. There are no enemies present in the game, so the players can focus on the narrative aspect of it. </p>\n<p>The players utilize an augmented reality device found on the station to access its security footage and recreate the events that happened here. It is possible to manipulate the footage like a recording, fast-forwarding it, pausing and rewinding. The players can see the characters move from room to room, or in some cases follow the character&#39;s path. One of the main game&#39;s aspects is its puzzles, as it is the main thing the players will be doing for most of the time.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T19:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/256/256a3188c2907eff4d7721ce044df5d7.jpg", "website": "http://ta.co.ma", "rating": 3.68, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 289, "owned": 1771, "beaten": 282, "toplay": 87, "dropped": 45, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 295, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 302, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fullbright"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Fullbright Company"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
