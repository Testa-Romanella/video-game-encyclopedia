{"id": 289086, "slug": "operator-demo", "name": "Operator Demo", "name_original": "Operator Demo", "description": "<p><em>Operator</em>\u00a0is an upcoming title entirely predicated on a player-driven narrative. The player is a resource officer in the CBI, India's intelligence agency. They are tasked with directing a captured field agent, voiced by USC alumni Akshaya Pattanayak, out of a Chinese military base. At each room, the player must rely on sensory data that the field agent provides them, along with using previously learned information, to safely navigate him out of the facility. Along the way, they gather intelligence on the next major attack the Chinese military is planning.\u00a0There are currently four unique endings planned. Eventually, there will also be a Chinese perspective to play through. It is somewhat based on my earlier\u00a0<em>Snatched\u00a0</em>demo, hence the visual similarities.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:30:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5ccd3f81457d393bd1beb69b1952ccb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamingtaygh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
