Mostly done as a test of the platform, and as a way to produce, test, and finish my first ever game in under a day.</p>\n<p>Opportunity stayed operational for 57 times its designed lifespan of 90 days, continuing to run for 5111 sols after landing and traveling a distance of 45 kilometers. Over 1000 recovery commands were transmitted to Opportunity between June 2018, when it lost contact with ground control due to a major dust storm, and February 2019, when the mission was declared over. The last piece of data sent to the rover was the song \"I'll Be Seeing You\" by Billie Holiday, which I attempted to recreate in Bitsy's tune editor for the end of the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Minor content warning for flashing images. The sprites are all animated in a two-frame loop, and they cover the screen in the final room of the game. The animation is relatively slow (about 3 frames per second), but be aware if you're sensitive to flashing.<br/></p>\n<p>Desktop:<br/>Arrow keys or WASD to move<br/>Space to advace text</p>\n<p>Mobile:<br/>Swipe to move<br/>Tap to advance text<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T04:38:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d5/5d575e3a11bf3034ab5590f3ddb2dfaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["symfo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
