You are placed through a series of tests which will have an influence on your story and the way it plays out. My goal for this is to place you as the player into a foreign unreal situation where you make decisions and wonder why and how you are there. I hope to keep you engaged in a story which slowly becomes uncovered as you continue playing but also make you question the decisions you made and wonder why your story ends the way it does.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/472/4727df770f5cf732f33ab7ba11f89c2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EdmundW196"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
