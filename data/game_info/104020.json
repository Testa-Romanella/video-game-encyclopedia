{"id": 104020, "slug": "graffiti-3d", "name": "Graffiti 3D", "name_original": "Graffiti 3D", "description": "<p>Graffiti 3D is a straightforward application with one purpose: enable you to doodle in 3d space with 3d meshes in colors/materials of your choice. An Oculus Rift and Leap Motion are recommended for the best experience.</p><p>If you like Graffiti 3D, check out my other VR projects Superstruct (http://jscottk.itch.io/superstruct) and Triangulate (http://jscottk.itch.io/triangulate).</p><p>A Hovercast (https://github.com/aestheticinteractive/Hover-VR-I...) menu on your off hand allows you to control brush color, size, material (cartoon, metal, porcelain, clay, neon, wireframe), and perform a variety of utility functions (such as export/import meshes, turn on augmented reality mode, undo strokes, and clear the canvas).</p><p>For users who interested in other input options, mouse input and xbox 360 controller work as well (see readme.txt).</p><p>If you want to touch up meshes after working on them in Graffiti 3D, you can export them in .obj format by pressing the \"e\" button (or \"export\" in hovercast).</p><strong>Graffiti inspiration</strong><p>Street artists and the techniques they use to make their pieces jump off their canvases have inspired me for a long time. After following the oculus rift kickstarter and developing an interest in stereoscopic media, I realized an opportunity existed to enable the creation of free-hand art that literally has depth to it. To my surprise, I couldn't find quite what I was looking for, so I went on a search for the best suitable 6dof input device and built it.</p><p>Please let me know if you run into any issues or have any suggestions.</p><p>\r\n\tNote:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tRead the included README.txt to learn how to deposit material, change colors, change the brush size, change the material, clear the canvas, undo strokes, set left-handed mode, turn on/off the interaction box, export/import meshes, and choose an image for the photosphere.</p><p>04/12/16</p><p>- Added resolution dialog to resolve issues some Windows 10 users were having with the application crashing on launch. If the issue occurs, try changing the quality setting to \"good\".</p><p>04/09/16</p><p>- Added support for Oculus runtime 1.3</p><p>- Note: if you're having issues getting this version to run, try messing with the quality settings in the resolution dialog that pops up at launch.</p><p>03/27/16</p><p>- Updated to the new Leap Motion Orion SDK</p><p>- Changed hand model to new Orion \"Capsule Hand\" model. The active material/color is applied the joints of the capsule hand.</p><p>- The pinch gesture (between the thumb and index finger) now initiates drawing as well as the old \"crimp\" gesture (between the thumb and side of hand). </p><p>02/28/2016</p><p>- Added function to store and recall positions and scales within the scene (left ctrl + number key to store, number key to recall).</p><p>- Added option to view the tracking camera bounds.</p><p>- Added function to rotate the camera (shift + mouse move).</p><p>- Fixed issue with neon material (it should now glow again).</p><p>- Fixed issue with colorpicker at scales &lt; 1.</p><p>- Extended scale slider to a maximum of 20 (instead of 10).</p><p>- Removed boundaries in passthrough mode; no clipping should ever occur with imported geometry in passthrough mode now.</p><p>- Clearing the canvas now removes any imported geometry from the scene. </p><p>02/23/2016</p><p>- Passthrough mode has been fixed. It is now accessible under the utility menu.</p><p>- The colorpicker has been revamped to be easier to use.</p><p>- Users can now scale the size of the camera.</p><p>- Users can now move the camera through the space with WASD keys.</p><p>- A tutorial has been added under the help menu.</p><p>- Multiple objects can now be imported at once. Place any desired objects to be imported in the \"import\" folder in the root directory. All .obj files will be imported simultaneously. </p><p>- Fixed issue with interaction box not properly disappearing when users set it to be hidden in config.txt. </p><p>- Fixed issue with colorpicker not appearing at scales other than 1.0<br/></p><p>still working on Orion support. It's a bit tricky because Hovercast/Hovercursor/Hoverboard don't appear to support it yet. </p><p>09/16/2015</p><p>- Fixed issue with importing objects; users should now be able to import custom meshes properly.</p><p>- Added ability to control mouse cursor with left analog stick on gamepad.</p><p>- Added cursor recentering when recentering camera (F2, F12, or R key)</p><p>- Fixed issue with saturation slider on hovercast menu.</p><p>- Fixed issue with neon material glow color not properly changing when material was changed.</p><p>09/14/2015</p><p>- Added new materials: neon glow material, diffuse clay material, and a generic metal material (set to white for silver, yellow for gold, and orange for copper). </p><p>- Added object importing. Users can now import custom objects (up to 65,000 vertices) to draw on.</p><p>- Added photosperes. Users can now load in custom 360 degree panoramic images as environments to draw within.</p><p>- Added bloom effects. Extremely shiny materials will now sometimes appear to glow slightly when reflecting bright light. </p><p>- Fixed some rendering issues; material lighting should look better.</p><p>- Added ability to turn off lights (fun with neon material). </p><p>- Added ReadMe UI for Leap Motion users (mouse/gamepad users can still access the ReadMe in the main menu).</p><p>- Updated to Unity 5.2f3, Leap Motion Core Assets 2.3.1, and Oculus 0.6.2 (compatible with Oculus runtime 0.7+)</p><p>- Temporarily removed passthrough mode; waiting on Leap Motion SDK update before that will work again (this is a priority).</p><p>- Removed fine control of stroke width with thumb distance; too many people reported issues using this feature. Change the stroke size in order to modify the drawing width. </p><p>04/22/2015</p><p>- Fixed issue with new UI; mouse input should now work properly for laptop trackpads.</p><p>- Fixed issue with augmented reality mode; the image in the right eye should now align properly with the skeletal model (along with the left eye).</p><p>- Fixed issue with glossy plastic material. It should now appear shiny/reflective in game. </p><p>- Palm token now displays the currently selected material.</p><p>- Cleaned up the help text window; the mask is now working properly.</p><p>04/20/2015</p><p>- Added ability to draw with new materials (including copper, silver, gold, plastic, wireframe, and cartoon material).</p><p>- Added support for mouse input and Xbox 360 controller input. Note: holding right click moves the cursor on the z axis, clicking mouse scroll wheel opens UI menu. When using controller, clicking right analog stick undoes the last stroke. <br/></p><p>- Updated Hovercast menu to utilize a look-based input cursor rather than a finger to select items in the left hand menu. Also, sliders now allow jump-to-select.</p><p>- Fixed issue with mesh normals and triangles; things look significantly better now.</p><p>- Added new UI menu that can be used with mouse and controller input. Help documentation (readme.txt) is now accessible in-game.</p><p>-  Leap Motion controller is automatically detected now and hides interaction box if there is no leap plugged in. The mouse cursor is hidden if a leap is detected.</p><p>- Updated to OVR 0.5.0.1, Leap Motion 2.2.4, and Unity 5.</p><p>02/20/2015</p><p>- Fixed an issue with left handed mode; drawing should now properly work while left handed.</p><p>- Fixed an issue with drawing while both hands are in view. Users can draw as long as the Hovercast menu is not visible.<br/></p><p>02/18/2015:</p><p>- Deactivated drawing while interacting with the Hovercast menu system (to avoid accidental drawing).</p><p>- Converted menu items to appropriate input types in the Hovercast menu system; shape selectors are now radio buttons, and the augmented reality button is now a checkmark. </p><p>- Changed \"Lightness\" to \"Brightness\" on the HSB color selector.</p><p>02/15/2015:</p><p>- Converted left hand controls to Hovercast menu (https://github.com/aestheticinteractive/Hovercast-...)</p><p>- Added in-game color and size controls, so sizes.txt and colors.txt are no longer needed.</p><p>- Moved commonly used keyboard shortcuts (undo, clear canvas, export mesh, augmented mode) to the left hand menu.</p><p>- Converted \"digital\" thumb drawing trigger to \"analog\" control (the distance between the thumb and hand determines line width instead of simply triggers drawing). This allows for variable width painbrush-like strokes.</p><p>01/14/2015:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Added passthrough camera/\"augmented reality\" access by pressing \"p\" key. Make sure \"allow images\" is selected in your leap motion driver before trying this.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Added ability to export meshes by pressing \"e\" key.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Fixed issues with undoing strokes. Now a \"stroke\" is considered to be one continuous drawn line.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Made a variety of performance adjustments (such as making undo/export run on their own threads). </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac7/ac77e50ba7d8f5f4bfe322be5d5f091b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jscottk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
