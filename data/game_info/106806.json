There was a cable tied between those last two trees! The bike keeps going, but you are stopped mid-air.  Then you fall into darkness.  You wake up dazed.  There is a woman outside digging...but digging what?  It doesn't feel right.  You have to get out of here!</p><p>Discover the secrets of the town of Erusal, escape a horrible maniac, and get spooked by this epistolary horror.</p><p>Minimum requirements: i5 processor, Nvidia GTX765M, 4 GB RAM 2 GB hard drive space<br/></p><p>Tags:</p><p>#horror #spooky #scary #note #notes #diary #journal #epistolary #ambience #creepy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f267337e473f0883c193cd15e67c1e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SpaceWedgieLLC"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
