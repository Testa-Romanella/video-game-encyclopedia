Bedlam is set entirely in the first-person but will explore other game genres from a first-person perspective.<br/><br/>In the game you play Heather Quinn (aka Athena) a colleague of Ross Baker (aka Bedlam). Heather is an overworked and underpaid scientist developing medical technology for corporate giant Neurosphere. One rainy Monday morning Heather volunteers as a test candidate for the new Neurosphere brain scanning tech - anything to get out of the office for a few hours.<br/><br/>But when she gets out of the scanner she discovers she's not only escaped the office, but possibly escaped real life for good! Heather finds herself trapped in Starfire - the violent sci-fi game she spent her teenage years playing - with no explanation, no backup and, most terrifyingly, no way out!<br/><br/>Join us in Early Access and get ready to unleash BEDLAM.<br/><br/>The description below was written by Christopher Brookmyre for the release of the novel in 2013<br/><br/>Heaven is a prison.

A realm where there are no consequences and no responsibilities, to the extent that even if you die, you can just respawn and start again.<br/><br/>Or would it be your worst nightmare?<br/><br/>Trapped in a place where every demon ever conjured by the human mind can be made flesh. Cut off from the real world, unable to see your family or friends ever again. Stuck in an endless state of war and chaos where the pain and fear feels real and from which not even death can offer an escape.<br/><br/>Prison or playground.
