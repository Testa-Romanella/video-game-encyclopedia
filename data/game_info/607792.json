It is based on the poem \"La maleta\", by <strong>Pedro Lezcano.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>La maleta</strong> tries to depict the hardships of the Canarian people during the 80s and how most, if not all the issues that the poem exposes, are still true today.</p>\n\n<p>The game is available in Spanish and English. It uses a very local language that I've tried to keep in the English translation, so, if you don't know some words, I encourage you to search them and learn about them. You can change the language in the main menu or using the setup tool that comes in the package.</p>\n<p>Once you have finished the game, the option to <strong>listen to the full poem </strong>becomes available in the main menu.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>La maleta</strong> is made with the amazing engine <strong>Adventure Game Studio. </strong>Thanks   a lot to the devs that have worked and keep working on it!
