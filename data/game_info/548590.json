Challenge your friends to the fastest time for 10 putts or try to beat your own times. The choice is yours.\u00a0 The game is Infinite meaning that there is an endless amount of islands on which you can attempt to get a hole in one.\u00a0This game was made in 2 days so I couldn't implement everything I wanted like LAN multiplayer, but might soon so stay notified.</p><p>.If you like it I would also appreciate it if you subscribed to my youtube channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6yrIeKixwgTJcgkj91to0g. I do a lot of fun procedural generation stuff there. This game was actually made using one of the scripts I made for my cellular automata island tutorial. ! hope you have fun!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d02/d02292db7b8d1be554e65f49fecbb3f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr.PatPatTomato"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
