Balls bounce off the rim and backboard just like how it would in the real world. Making it even more realistic is the witty comments from the announcer and the cheers and jeers from fans around the stadium. Overall speaking, this is another great arcade title from Skyworks Interactive.\u201d<br/>OneMoreTap<br/><br/>\u201cFrom the vibration of the hoop when the ball is \u201cwalking the rim\u201d to the bouncing of the ball on the floor after a shot, the sounds are well done and quite authentic.
