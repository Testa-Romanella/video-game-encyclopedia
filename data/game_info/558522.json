This method can make you hit the targets but with a very low precision rate.</em></p>\n<p><strong>*</strong><em> <strong>Last tip</strong>: Avoid automatic fire, they are fun but </em><em>not good for hitting anything! You should Aim your shots and know your weapon behavior before being successful in the challenges</em><em>. <strong>This is a Realistic Simulation that brings you the Real Challenges you would face </strong></em><strong><em>in becoming a real shooter, this is not</em><em>\u00a0an FPS game</em> ;)</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>As an extra just for fun, this version includes the RPG-7 rocked propelled grenade launcher and the SAM missile Stinger for shooting down some aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>More updates will be sent along the way to include more Weapons and Levels.\u00a0Send you Feedback and Ideas so I can include them in the next release!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Realistic Simulation Designed by Mechanical Engineer</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T06:31:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58d/58d6e14a185c7c43768533d4797e0dad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Maloke"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
