However, if you don't have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>You are an agent in the service of Tzar Yaromir. Lukomorye is still not free. You must face new challenges to help your friends, the Tzar and his royal family, combat the warlike Savir invaders. You'll encounter exotic scenarios, like steppes patrolled by wolves an underwater abyss and an eerie mushroom kingdom. You'll have the opportunity to become a member of the Order of the Sword, if you qualify. You'll have your faithful sidekick, Agent Kolobok, to accompany you. You may go mad in Argimon's Mad Dwarves' Castle, so heed any hints there carefully.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"Luko II\" as your travel destination. It's recommended you reach at least level 29 before taking on the challenges posed by this expansion.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:14:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ce1bac00a5dd8f43ca8bd001a6074bc.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
