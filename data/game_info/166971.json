Six middle school students participated, and they learned about the basics of computer coding, the function of the Internet, and most importantly, how  to create visual novels using the TyranoBuilder visual novel engine. This brief demo represents the work of one 13 year-old student over the course of the two-week camp. It's her very first game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c8/0c8b1373a98b989fac2d9d854cc054c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WinstonTeenCenter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
