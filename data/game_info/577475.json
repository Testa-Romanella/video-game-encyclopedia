{"id": 577475, "slug": "little-night-terrors", "name": "Little Night Terrors", "name_original": "Little Night Terrors", "description": "<p>Your little sister has been suffering from terrible nightmares nearly every night. It has come to a point where you know something is not right, and you wish you could help her through it.  Somehow your wish gets granted, for the next night, you find yourself in another of her nightmares. <br/><br/>Now it is your job as her big sister to guide her through it. Fight little night terrors and keep your sister from harm as you navigate through the darkness that has been haunting her.  Your sister is incredibly scared, so you cannot just go around fighting monsters without a care. If she gets too scared, your sister will wake up and you\u2019ll lose your chance. Try to reassure her with hugs and other forms of care to make her feel safe. You will have to watch her closely and read signals she might give you to help you navigate through the nightmare.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Current mechanics:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Control:   <ul><li>You control the big sister who is being followed closely by the little sister (WASD)\r\n  </li></ul></li><li>Enemies:   <ul><li>Small enemies will attack you on sight.\u00a0You must kick (LMB) or (RMB) to either kill them or have them keep their distance.\r\n  </li><li>One big enemy cannot be fought because your sister gets too scared.
