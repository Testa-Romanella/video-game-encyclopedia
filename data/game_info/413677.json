The theme was \"Repair\".<br/></p>\r\nRules:\r\n<p>The goal of the bus is to keep your bus running as <strong>long as possible</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>There are five pieces of equipment in the bus that you need to maintain. Watch their status lights:</p>\n<ul><li>If the light is green, its working fine.</li><li> If its amber, its faulty, and you should repair it.</li><li> If its red, you should <strong>really</strong> repair it! Any red equipment will cause the integrity of the bus to deteriorate and eventually stop.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Repair equipment by walking up to it and entering in the button codes that light up on the machine. If you enter a code incorrectly, the code will reset and you will have to start again.<br/></p>\r\nControls (Xbox Controller Required):\r\n<ul><li>Analogue Stick: Move Left/Right</li><li>A Button: Jump</li><li>Left-Bumper: Zoom Out</li><li>D-Pad/A-B-X-Y: Enter repair code sequences</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>David Eichman - Programming </li><li>Michael Gillon - Level Design and Effects</li><li>Craig Innes - Art</li><li>David Strachan - Programming</li><li>Alicja Uklega - Art</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T04:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83a/83a52130dd30297f3f705c64f2f1ec1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Craig Innes"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
