The things that make this Dark Paradise special are far too many to count, but I guess Nigelopia above all else is a place where all beings are accepted and fundamentally considered worthy of love. <br/><br/>Nigelopia may be different from the cultures you have come to know through your lives and even your games, but it is such a charming and hilarious place that those differences won\u2019t even matter much once you step in! Enjoy humorous and playfully raunchy cutscenes between Nigelopia\u2019s ethnically diverse and polyamorous inhabitants. Unlock new powers, and new conversations between them as you complete stages.<br/><br/>Nigelopian people, and the various Shadow Beings that coexist with them called Umbrakin, are surrounded and bound by a force called \u201cThe Nigelopian Dark Power,\u201d or just \u201cThe Dark Power\u201d for short. It courses through their veins and helps them accomplish their goals. It is this power that allows them to protect their country from those who threaten their way of life\u2026 and also to spar with their friends!<br/><br/>The intuitive and tight design of the controls will make you feel right at home, especially if you already love those high speed platformers to begin with, and even if you don\u2019t! Nigelopia Mini Mix is designed to be far more forgiving and accessible than those X-tremely difficult, Mega-hard games of yesteryear.<h3>Enjoy Nigelopia I GUESS??!
