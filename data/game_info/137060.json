Your job as a neomage, is to find this Replicator and destroy it, killing any omics that get in your way.You need to use your skill and speed if you are to take them out. Find and destroy the Replicator and find out who the mastermind behind the device is. If you don&#39;t, your peaceful citadel and its citizens will be at risk. You have learned that the device cannot simply be destroyed be shooting at it. Your side-mission will be to collect all the Replicator keys, which contains parts of the nullify code to disable the impervious energy barrier that surrounds it.
