But what makes you a good detective, is to know which lies to bite into, and which to ignore.</p>\n<p>Because the murderer is among these people, and you are the lucky detective assigned to this mess of a case.</p>\n<p>It's about the satisfaction of catching someone telling a lie, and getting every little detail out of a conversation.</p>\n<p>Gameplay<br/>Tell Me Everything is a text-based short-story adventure game, with a word-puzzle on top. It's a game about pushing your luck and gathering information to catch the killer.</p>\n<p>Features</p>\n<ul><li>The game currently contains the first episode with three variations.</li><li>Simple point-and-click action. Can be played solely using the mouse.</li><li>Hint system available if you are ever stuck.</li><li>Mood-meter to track the suspects four breaking points.</li><li>Four calm jazz soundtracks.</li><li>New episodes in the works.</li></ul>\n<p>Episodes</p>\n<ul><li>Episode 1 : The Porcelain Paradox</li><li>Episode 2 : The Horrors of Hospitality</li><li>Episode 3 : The Fiscal Freefall<br/>Release mid-August\u00a02018.</li><li>Episode 4 : The Tormented Triage<br/>Release mid-September\u00a02018.</li><li>Episode 5 : The Devil's Doorstep<br/>Release mid-October 2018.</li></ul>\n<p>Expectations<br/>The murder mysteries are written to be around 30 minutes each, and since the game has a huge amount of dialogue, it is sadly not fully voiced.</p>\n<p>Currently, the three case variations stack around 1-2 hours if you push through, and around 4-5 hours if you like exploring all the possibilities.</p>\n<p>The graphics are crude, and the gameplay is simple. It is meant as a thin-mint of an interesting story, not a massive game.</p>\n<p>Is it niche? Yes. Might this game not be for you? Maybe.</p>\n<p>But for those who love unraveling mysteries, I hope you are up for a challenge or two.</p>\n<p>Spoilers<br/>Since this game is a murder mystery, we politely ask all streamers and YouTubers to either not reveal who the killer is in each case, or at least let your audience know that there are spoilers ahead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/cece365b226bac117c8231a06e230566.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nils Munch"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
