Claw your life from the hands of these beasts, all the while learning their darkest secrets and gaining their incomprehensible strength - but beware the effects on your ever fickle human mental state!</p>\n<p>Its stupid though, so don\u2019t even worry about all that. I only hope it may give you a chuckle or two, and by the way any bugs are because your character is going mad and its actually really good lore and fits the theme because the stuff you\u2019ve learned mangles your head up. Honest.</p>\n<p>I think this game turned out pretty good considering my talents, but is still missing a hefty amount of features that could make it my magnum opus/a truly mediocre game, such as some insanity-based game modifiers or any sort of loss state (for now you can only feel a bit of shame when the eye in the corner disappears). I shall continue working on it and hopefully make it good at some point.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ea/3ea6a5d0616340bc9697f1e8ac181cde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["koficola"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
