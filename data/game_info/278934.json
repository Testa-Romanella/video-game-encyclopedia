Control the PRESENT to direct the FUTURE, only for 5 turns for each team.(basically it's a turn based game, I don't know if it qualifies for the jam's theme)</p>\n<p>2. It is a 2 PLAYER GAME, 1 keyboard and 1 mouse needed.</p>\n<p>3. You can control your troops/add waypoints only when the GAME IS PAUSED(Can I call it TIME STOP?) Troops will move when the game is resumed.</p>\n<p>4. When the turn of your colour comes, select one of your units and add waypoints.</p>\n<p>5. Don't forget to DE-SELECT your selected unit before selecting another unit.</p>\n<p>6.\u00a0 Archers and musketeers will shoot automatically\u00a0 when the enemy comes in THEIR VIEW\u00a0and when they are STILL. Horse-archers\u00a0will shoot automatically at their nearest enemy even when they are MOVING.\u00a0</p>\n<p>7. Artillery\u00a0will shoot automatically at the GIVEN RANGE\u00a0 IRRESPECTIVE of whether its enemies are present in its view or not, but shouldn't be moving. But unlike arrows and bullets, cannons will do damage only when they get DESTROYED/STOP ( imagine them flying overhead and landing on the ground at the end).</p>\n<p>8. Hills, houses, forests, and rivers have their own EFFECTS. Hover the mouse over them to see the effects.</p>\n<p>9. There is a 'BUILDING MECHANIC'. If you have money, you can build fences and trenches on the battlefield when the game is paused.</p>\n<p>10. Attack on FLANKS and REAR of a unit is more effective. Attack on the rear is more effective than an attack on flanks . There 's NO FRIENDLY FIRE</p>\n<p>11.\u00a0 Artillery shots can have a SURROUNDING DAMAGE. The RANGE of artillery can be changed.</p>\n<p>12.\u00a0 KILLING THE ENEMY'S MONARCH will instantly damage all your enemy troops</p>\n<p>13. A unit being CLOSE TO ITS MONARCH will increase its resistance.</p>\n<p>14. Units IN MELEE CAN'T DISENGAGE</p>\n<p>15. Units will FIGHT\u00a0 TO\u00a0\u00a0DEATH. There's no routing allowed.</p>\n<p>16. Battle is OVER when all units of a colour are DEAD. There's NO STALEMATE. In case of a stalemate, an existing army will randomly gain an extra turn.</p>\n\n<p>Key assignments:</p>\n<p>1.
