I am planning to make a gallery kind of environment I will find and place all the models that I can find made by me from 3D Modeling &amp; Animation 1 to 3D Modeling &amp; Animation 3. I will place them like a gallery I will try to make a Full VR (HTC Vive) HMD with Controllers.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\tI choose to make a Full VR (HTC Vive) HMD with Controllers because I haven\u2019t made any VR game before so I want to try to create a scene for VR. The scene will look like a gallery space with 3D models that I can find that were made by myself. The only problem is that I don't have a VR headset. I hope it will work if the VR headset is on.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\tI will use the XR Interaction Toolkit 0.10.0( not anymore) to create the project. And I will load my models into the scene and place it in the room-scale area. Some of the models will be animated and some will not. I will color most of them.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T11:18:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/102fc0db9a384521204f990800ec9ad7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex.Chen2022"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
