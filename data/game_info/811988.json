Their goal is to help people, suffering from deaths, wounds, illness and hunger. They heal the world trembling from violence.</p>\n<p>In this game you are playng as a pilot, driving \u0441argo airplane that drops the humanitarian aid to people suffered from war. The flight is risky, the weather si not very good. The more you help, the more score points you get.\r\n</p><p>Used Odin, DoTween, Used sounds from Alexander Zhelanov\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T15:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3eb/3eba75222b7ec0064147b5170f1cf446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tallaks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
