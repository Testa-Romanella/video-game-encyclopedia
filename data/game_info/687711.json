Basically I started at 1am BST, made a game until 1:59, took a picture for instagram, and bam it was 1am GMT. So boom, here is a game I made in exactly 0 hours... and it shows. But don't let that stop you!\u00a0See if you can pick up all 1000 white balls, giving you a giant gravitational force for 1000N, yes my physics knowledge is incredible. Dont get hit by those pesky triangles though! They will chew through you quicker than my dog when it sees a taco. That joke didn't even make sense... I'm tired... I'm going to bed \ud83d\ude02<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for taking a look at this mostrosity! Maybe I could intrest you in some actually half decent games?\u00a0I have a lot of jam entries for both 2D, 3D and VR games, would love for you to check them out!\u00a0GoldenDonkeyProductions - itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:13:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82f/82f2b68dac15baf648600cec6a3ed68f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GoldenDonkeyProductions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
