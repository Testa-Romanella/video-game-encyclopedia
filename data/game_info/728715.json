The intended solution of the (probably 2nd) pearl uses the sea grass, but there are certainly other ways to access it.\u00a0 I like the idea of one large map with multiple mini puzzles, but it can\u00a0 trivialize the puzzles because they rely on being in (or out of) a certain phase., and the size of the map makes it difficult for me to guarantee the players phase at any given point.</p>\n\n<p>I like how the graphics came out, I like how it feels to explore. I included an infinite air mode so that people can enjoy it that way if they choose.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T09:24:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda5c8b58c033f955964e6140500d2ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MatthewLacker"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
