The initial project had a potential with already few mechanics made during only one day. The idea of controlling an environnement and not an entity is at the center of idea.</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Fundamental order vs Integral Chaos\", so the game is inspired by the physics fundamental interactions, but with some game design compromises. This is not a simulator, rather a proposition to mix knowns about quantum physics and game design experience about changing the main focus from an entity to an environnement.</p>\n<p>The actual stade of the project is EARLY_ALPHA</p>\n<p>The project is still in developpement, which means that some major features are not included yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mandatory features are (non-exhaustive list):\u00a0</p>\r\nFeatureImplementation stadeActual phaseFull English/French<br/>switch systemEARLY_ALPHAIn developpement MenuEARLY_ALPHAIn developpementCollectablesEARLY_ALPHAReady for testsStrong Interaction<br/>Gameplay MechanicMID_ALPHATBDFull Android supportMID_ALPHAIn developpementImproved level selection<br/>and locked levels systemMID_ALPHATBDWeak Interaction<br/>Gameplay Mechanic<br/>LATE_ALPHATBD\"Explode the lab\"<br/>game modeLATE_ALPHATBDReferral systemEARLY_BETATBDMobile IAPEARLY_BETATBDStandalone IAPMID_BETATBDAchievements<br/>(Steam and PlayStore only)LATE_BETATBD\r\n<p>The optionnal features are (non-exhaustive list):</p>\r\nFeatureConditionsAds-IAP unefficientMutliplayer (Race mode)-Enough MAU<br/>-Players requestsCrossplatform scoreboard-Players requests\r\n<p>I wish to publish the final version of the game on Steam, Play Store and maybe others.
