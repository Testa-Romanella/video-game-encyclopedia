While most programming games use their own imperative language, Polynomials: Enterprise Edition uses a highly limited constraint-based language based on Diophantine Equations. According to the Matiyasevich (MRDP) Theorem, this language is technically Turing complete, but limitations on the implementation and practical constraints prevent it from being even remotely useful as a programming language.</p>\n<p>Uses math.js:\u00a0http://mathjs.org/</p>\n<p>Created for the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2018</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb0/fb06a6dacdad3aacdcaaf9ccca21e082.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["trkern"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
