The theme was throw it to me. You must remember the timing between swings so you can hit the ball back to the enemy. The thing is, you can't see the ball! You must be accurate to the nearest 1/2 second to match the time it takes for the enemy to swing at your ball. For example:\u00a0if it takes 1 second for the enemy to react to your swing, you should react in about 1 second before swinging. If it takes the enemy 2 seconds to react to your swing, you should wait 2 seconds before swinging again.</p>\n<p>(click or press space to swing)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Made in godot, everything was made by me during the jam except the\u00a0textures are from cc0textures.com, font and sound are by Kenney.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T13:56:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3ef65156cd9c5ea098ea0ea24e996b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DrewV"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
