More specifically, it allows paint.net to be used with Amanda Hudgins' 100 Button Prototype for #1000ButtonProject (100 Button version\u00a0 can be viewed at http://buttonsare.cool). If you don't have access to this board, there's not a ton of reason for you to be here but thanks for stopping by!</p>\n<p>This was created for the month long 100 Button Game Jam and has not been tested with the board yet (hence the Beta status). The program and this page will be edited once testing has occurred.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/416/416645c26c08cf9ec05eea46217bcb68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["R25th"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
