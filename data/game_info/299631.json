{"id": 299631, "slug": "super-jump-n-bump", "name": "Super Jump 'n Bump", "name_original": "Super Jump 'n Bump", "description": "\"Super Jump 'n Bump\" is an enhanced version of the classic DOS PC game \"Jump 'n Bump\" by Brainchild Designs. At the core, it's a simple, fast paced local multiplayer game where you simply jump on your friends for the most kills - the controls are super simple, even non-gamers can get into it which makes it great for parties, or playing with the whole family, including kids! (A censored mode is included!)<br/><br/>Now you can have up to 8 players on the same computer, multiple levels, and a level editor!  <br/><br/>And it is 100% controllable with gamepads, making it perfect for a living room game. A flexible control system lets you maximise the number of people that can play depending on the hardware you have.  Mix and choose; keyboard adds 2 players, mouse adds 1 player, gamepads can add one player each, or can be split to add 2 players each!  No settings, just grab a controller and join in!Full List Of Features<ul><li> Up to 8 players on the same game!<br/></li><li> Full gamepad support<br/></li><li> Share controllers / keyboard / mouse to add lots of people. Optionally \"split\" any gamepad for 2 players each, so 2 gamepads means 4 players; 4 gamepads means 8 players!<br/></li><li> Selectable animal characters, and 8 colours to customise them with<br/></li><li> 4 level themes, and 9 levels, plus the original classic level (aiming for 6 themes and 12 levels on release)<br/></li><li> Power ups! Every now and again a crate is dropped, whoever gets it first gets a random ability for 30 seconds; pogo stick, anti-gravity boots, or rocket pack!<br/></li><li> Multiple levels to choose from, and \"rounds\" - each game takes place over 5 randomly selected levels<br/></li><li> A built in level editor! You can optionally use the gamepad to make levels, so you never have to switch to keyboard or mouse!<br/></li><li> (Aiming to have Steam Workshop support integrated so you can download free user-made levels through Steam!)</li></ul><br/>There are other \"couch multiplayer\" games out there but few as simple and straight forward as this. Give a controller to a non-gamer friend and watch them get caught up in it!  And parents, you can semi-permanently enable \"censored\" mode, which turns the blood splatters into confetti and lollies, as this is a great game to play with your kids too!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c03/c03d3aaf16aff47ba67908c74a767d39.jpg", "website": "https://www.domariusgames.com/super-jump-n-bump", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Domarius Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Domarius Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
