The Earth became inhabitable and unstable to live on. People are so invested in creation and development until they reach the limits and attempt to exceed their desires. Once a dream transforms into a nightmare. Certain experiments failed and the world is now consumed by monstrous mutated insectum. Despite the approaching threat of the extinction event of all living beings, the scientists and engineers came up with an idea to save the day and how to restore our Mother Nature. They invented robots that search for seeds to rebuild our ecosystem. These intelligent machines fight the monsters to protect the Earth\u2019s last citizens and to help the vegetation grow anew.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T09:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/729/729daaa30aef9a745674f0fed16cfc53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yutyrannus Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
