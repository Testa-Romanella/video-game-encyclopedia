Here at Exford, we\u2019re dedicated to providing immaculate service and making the world a better place. To do that we have invented a whole new lobbyist generation system.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Brand new technology has enabled us to simulate an accurate representation of the american political system in a game format.</p>\n<p>Introducing \u201cLobbyist Clicker 3D\u201d.</p>\n<p>Your primary objective is to gain influence over the USA. This is done by letting lobbyists speak with members of the congress in order to persuade them into voting for something that will benefit us. To do that, you will need Lobbyists. Lots of lobbyists.</p>\n<p>To generate lobbyists, you can click on our pristine headquarters. Clicking will initially generate one lobbyist per click, but hiring contractors at our special operations branch will help you generate more. You can also use the special ops building to purchase passive lobbyist generation. That way you\u2019ll be able to avoid finger cramps. The more lobbyists you have, the more influence you will have over the American congress. This game is political.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special contractors such as teachers and engineers (many of whom are former MT students by the way) and improvements can be unlocked by investing in government funding directly at the congress building.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have a quite exciting time in \u201cLobbyist Clicker 3D\u201d!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:54:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1a/a1a89e20e73225ddf3942403635067d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["RobotGandhi", "Linnet5"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
