All coincidences are random and are only a figment of your imagination. Developers do not intend to offend anyone.<br/><br/>The scene of the game takes place in the country of Rusland. At the next re-election of the president, in 2024, the opposition was completely suppressed by law enforcement agencies, by order of the president, whose name will forever remain sinister for, in the future, a slave country - Zhmih. Those who disagreed were destined to rot in prisons and be tortured in the Yarosville colonies. It does not matter who you are: an old man or a child, a man or a woman. An unenviable fate befell almost everyone. Six years later, the totalitarian state finally prevailed over rebellious resistance. From the opposition there were either small groups of people hiding in the dark, or loners sitting at home. Rusland became a closed state in which food of poor quality was distributed according to coupons, and such concepts as personal life, rights and freedom ceased to exist. Was created its own Internet network, finally fenced off the state from the outside world.<br/><br/>However, as already mentioned, those few remained who wanted to seize power from the enemies of the people. One of them turned out to be the eternally lonely Bitard. In his garage, he was able to create a device of shit and sticks that allows you to manipulate the minds of other people. Thanks to this technology, Bitard was able to infuse the consciousness of certain people with whom he had family ties. Now, with the help of this machine, Bitard will have to get through a huge amount of opposing force, headed by Zhmih himself. He will have to climb to the very top of the great tower in which Zhmih settled, and steal the last hope for the restoration of peace in the country, called \"Peace Data\". It would seem that having such a machine would not be difficult to do, but, every time a character dies, time rolls back, thereby resetting all progress to the starting point.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T08:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e95/e95c1ecc5f661ad0582de148f8a16ebf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ko4erga"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ko4erga"], "esrb_rating": null}
