In this sequel, Jack and Shadow find themselves once again in the mean streets of Grant City, ensnared in a labyrinth of crime, corruption, and betrayal. Although he swore he&#39;d never return to the city that left him for dead, the plight of an innocent girl draws Jack back. The game features Hong Kong cinema-style action and new gameplay mechanics such as greater interaction with Shadow, disarm moves, a 360-degree fighting engine, melee weapon battles, and a dramatic spherical slow-motion diving system.</p>", "metacritic": 52, "released": "2005-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T16:13:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/64b/64b64b8b916330cb9e245cafd3e1f7aa.jpg", "website": "http://www.deadtorights2.com", "rating": 2.8, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 8, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 572, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["Xbox", "PlayStation 2", "PC"], "developers": ["Namco Hometek"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
