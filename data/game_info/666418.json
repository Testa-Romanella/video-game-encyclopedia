The spice of the game depends on which mode you choose, as of now, three are available.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In insidious mode, one or two players will be selected as the insidious and must disrupt the efforts of the rest of players with the help of special equipment they receive in their secret room. Minor weapons are scattered for everyone to pick up. Who to trust, that's up to you.<br/><br/><br/>In Victim Hunt, each player receives a target they must disable without the rest of players realizing. Disabling your objective will trigger a vulnerability status which you have to hide for 60 seconds. Watch your back.<br/><br/><br/>A player will be selected as the stalker, which cannot see the rest of players and must disable them by hearing their voices and footsteps. Mode especially effective with the implemented Steam Audio solution.<br/><br/><br/>Plot, betray or defend yourself in the first location of the game: <strong>The Ellipse</strong>. An introvert original piece of architecture to escape from while trying to solve the 24 different riddles and minigames it features.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Score System</strong></li></ul>Each game finished will award points, you can use those points in the lobby to acquire mutagens, poses or cosmetic addons.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Mutagens</strong></li></ul>Mutagens moderately alter the way the game is played. Acquire them at the shop and let the host activate them for different effects: gun spawn, smoke devices, jammers, disguises, etc.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Spatialized Voice Chat</strong></li></ul>TAG uses Steam Audio spatializer for several sounds and its voice chat system. Voice is physically occluded and attenuated at runtime which means you may eavesdrop a conversation behind a door but no one will hear you scream behind a concrete wall. If you don't want to use voice, there's also a proximity text chat implemented.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Community</strong></li></ul>Friends are not included but I want to slowly shape a community of players and content creators interested in the game. If you are a content creator and want to be featured in the lobby's community board, feel free to follow the instructions in #communityadd channel inside the game's Discord.<br/><br/>Use forums or join the brand new Discord to suggest new modes or mutagens, report issues there or check the progress on next scene: Deliasi Platform.<br/><br/>*Stalker gamemode can be played with 2 players but more are recommended.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T02:21:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48ebf605d2e961b8115920cc8fed213.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 389, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SelianiDEV"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SelianiDEV"], "esrb_rating": null}
