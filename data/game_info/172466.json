(As of Patch Bros. #8)</p><p>I originally made this with VR and the Vive in mind, so It uses SteamVR, which should also work with the Rift, but I don't have one, so I can't test it.</p><p>If you don't have a VR headset, it will default to the standard Unity FPS controller (if I did it right).</p><p>Super Maker Bros. is a series by The Super Beard Bros. where they play fan submitted levels, based on a theme. At the end of each level, Jirard (usually) comments on the level with his (stamp filled) art, while Alex blindly awaits the masterpiece.</p><p><strong>Stuff I didn't make</strong>:</p><p>The featured artworks were (obviously) made by @JKCompletesIt, @FacianeA and @PokeKellz.</p><p>+ the YouTube thumbnail for the Super Maker Bros. series was made by @CauseImDanJones</p><p>This Mario Maker font by Gnarizard was used for the signs in the gallery.<br/></p><p>Mario Paint BGM 1 Remix</p><p>Facility from Goldeneye 64</p><p>A certain version of All Star by Smash Mouth</p><p>Cantina from Star Wars</p><p>Pok\u00e9mon Center from Red/Blue</p><p>Saw.jpg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/424/424b53be5801f9c1bbd8db44761cc93d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HTML_Earth"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
