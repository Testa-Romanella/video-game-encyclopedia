Unfortunately, your shady demolition business can't afford a wrecking ball so you'll have to use your car instead. Don't think you can go about your job as you please. Holdout shoppers are still in the mall, and dangerous mayhem is around every corner!<br/><br/>The goal is to destroy as many things in the mall as possible. Getting stuck for more than a few seconds or hitting too many shoppers means game over. You won't go unrewarded for your efforts. For every object you destroy you will receive points. Points can be used to unlock abilities to greatly enhance the demolition experience.<br/><br/>If you gain enough points in a certain mall you will unlock an ability! Abilities help you get unstuck, avoid shoppers, or destroy objects.<br/><ul><li>Boost-Gain a quick burst of speed to blast through obstacles or get unstuck.<br/></li><li>Balls Of Steel-Magically drops down 4 huge steel balls from the sky, destroying everything in their path.<br/></li><li>Ghost-Fear those shoppers no more!
