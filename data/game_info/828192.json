Hoody has to go for a walk and clear his head so he can go back to sleep. What he doesn't know, is it could be the beginning of the collapse. Hopefully he is prepared enough to make it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game features prominently lighting effects to drive the story forward, but I was careful to ensure none of it entered 'flashy' territory. There are tense moments, but other than that no hard swearing or graphic scenes. It's short as it's meant to be a demo and intro to my stories, but there's plenty to read so if you're into pointy-clicky games without hard puzzles, this's for you. Also features some simple chiptunes I made, which hopefully everyone finds atmospheric.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also there's 'hand drawn' cutscenes throughout the game that I did as illustrations so hopefully those add some context as well.</p>\n<p>Based off my apocalypse fiction series, \"PNW Affliction\" which I hope someone will check out if they want to sink their teeth into a huge indy book series, perfect to read now or toss in a bunker for later.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T16:51:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be2/be2b9b1c0e8e9c07ba76be7f5f9df832.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chance Paladin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
