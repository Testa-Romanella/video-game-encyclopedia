It is your mission to take control of the kingdom of Kish and conquer your enemies, in order to become Lugal Ki\u0161ki, King of the Universe.<br/><br/>The Sumerians, or \"the black-headed people\" (Sag\u0303-g\u0303i-ga in their native tongue), were the first people to invent both civilization and writing. Their well-organised and state-run societies make the perfect setting for a strategic video game. In King of the Universe, you will not only try to conquer your enemies, you will also have to take care of your own people. <br/><br/>Through military means you gather land and slaves, and through economic means you build new structures for your people.

This game is about balance, and only by finding it will you become King of the Universe.<br/><br/><ul><li>Tiles<br/>Claim tiles and build or destroy structures.
