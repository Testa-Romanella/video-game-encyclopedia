It was a normal day when employees were making wires. But little did they know that the wires were being made from a mysterious cursed pitch black mixture. For a moment, a few wires started to float pair together to make a ring in the air composed of their selves, and then turned into things called.... Hairballs. The legend says that hairballs are made of 100 ropes, each with 3 segments, and simulates them physically while moving them about, when they can actually KILL THINGS (in this game)!! The hairballs started to twirl around and spin in place, then for a split second flew away from each other. The employees started running out of the building, but got swarmed by the newly-called \"HAIRBALL INVASION.\" Also, Fordon Greeman, you basically, were trapped at the time, now you MUST ESCAPE!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd26f6a1add21c953fffa8fe191db40c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["donnaken15"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
