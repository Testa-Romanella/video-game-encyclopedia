{"id": 425665, "slug": "breakout-201", "name": "Breakout 201", "name_original": "Breakout 201", "description": "<p>\u00a0The main overview of the game is that the player is playing as Dr James Osbourne. The player has just woken up and they are suddenly a robot. They turn to their left to find writing on the wall, to understand that they must kill the other robots in order to escape. As they enter other rooms, they find other patients which have been turned into robots which they must also kill. Each room is going to portray a different part of the hospital. The game is going to portray a robot who was a teacher of how to turn people into robots, but he then woke up as a robot. The main protagonist of the game is Donald Richards, a student who wanted to rebel against his lecturer as he didn\u2019t believe turning people into robots was morally correct. He decided to turn Dr James Osbourne into a robot and set a plan to kill him.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The whole game was created and designed by myself in April 2019. The game was made using Unity and designed in Adobe Photoshop.\u00a0 One of the main outcomes I have learned from this project was to practice with 3D modelling. This is because I\u00a0believe the game could have had better models throughout the game to make it feel more immersive to the player. Another element I\u00a0have learned from this project was to take time designing the individual rooms. This is because a year later, I\u00a0believe I\u00a0could have designed this game to make a more linear structure with the narrative.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:36:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e89/e892b4caf97f75f86172a6894214ba1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacinta Jobsz Allen"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
