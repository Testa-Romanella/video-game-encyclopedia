With the help of an AI named Docx, your job is to deliver data packages across the network. How do you do this, you might ask? By planning out the path that you want the Package(s) to take ahead of time! Using problem solving and analytical thinking, you have to ensure an effective and secure delivery path for the Package. As time goes on, things naturally become more complicated as more elements are introduced (it\u00a0<em>is</em> an internship, after all). So what are you waiting for? Get pushing!</p><p>Note: This game was created as a part of a senior project, read the \"About the Project\" section if you want a bit more info!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T04:28:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44f472aec3408d08afc35d66ea79667d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["arduino111"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
