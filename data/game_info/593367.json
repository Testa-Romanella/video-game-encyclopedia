With each area bigger and stranger than the last, you'll have to pay attention to your surroundings to survive!<br/><br/><strong>Physics-based movement</strong><br/>Playing this game is more than just running and jumping! Movement is feel-based in Rocket Cave Adventure- you'll have to master the controls and weight of each vehicle to be able to traverse deeper and deeper into the caves.<br/><br/><strong>Randomized skill tree</strong><br/>Throughout each run, you will be given a skill tree that will be populated with different skills each time you play! However, you won't know the skills you are given until you unlock them by collecting enough XP from enemies- so don't rush too fast through the levels.<br/><br/><strong>Meta progression</strong><br/>Gather gold throughout your runs and spend it on long-term upgrades back at the starting hub. Upgrade your starting health or increase the size of the skill tree for your runs!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T04:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/214acd49e56881a6581c8c8b51fe9174.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boxedworks"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["boxedworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
