From the start we dedicated ourselves to creating a hectic environment that'd force the player to go all out and be on top of several different fronts, all aiming to get them.</p>\n<ul><li><strong><em>Protect The Heart Of The World</em></strong></li></ul>\n<p>As the Sole Defender, it's your job to protect the Heart of the World, the source and endpoint of all souls, the origin of the cycle of reincarnation itself! There are many Wisps, governed by the negative emotions they carried when they were alive, and they are looking forward to destroying the world they hold such hatred for, so you must stop them! How?</p>\n<ul><li><strong><em>Four Different Turrets</em></strong></li></ul>\n<p>Build defenses in the form of\u00a0the Keen Eye, the Burning Will, the Torrential Force and the Glacial Shard, each turret with its strenghts and weaknesses. Experiment with different setups to face the Wisps and see what works for you! However, something tells me these turrets can't get it done on their own...</p>\n<ul><li><strong><em>So How About You Take Control Of Your Turrets?</em></strong></li></ul>\n<p>Possess your turrets and take direct control as the game switches from a third person tower defense to a first person shooter! When a turret is left on its own it will slowly charge up over time, and when it's fully charged the enemies better get out of the way when you unleash their full power by taking control!<br/></p>\n<p>Step into the arena of the fate of the world, fend off those hateful wisps, and make sure that the world survives another day.</p>\n<p><strong><em>You are the Sole Defender of the Souls of all!</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:12:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/add/add24168eb61ab9aca3d4512c52f168d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["No Idle Hands"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
