The goal is to escape from the booby traps in the dungeon and to go forward\u00a0as far as we can. This game is an endless running game and is designed to never end until the player gets hit by trap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game world consists of axes that\u00a0simultaneously go left and right, knives coming out of the ground, spears thrown from the walls, and similar components that we are familiar with in booby traps. The more player jumps over the traps and runs forward, the more points player gets. On the contrary, if the player fails to do so and gets caught in traps, the game will be over.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Press the red \"Stop\" button to stop immediately. Press any space to jump and avoid from obstacles. There is no need to move the character. He runs automatically.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T13:57:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b754ccf2e953cf092d6250ba83096892.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Eyup Can Turgut"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
