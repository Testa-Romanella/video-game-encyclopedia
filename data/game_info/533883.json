But inside the mall, things turn in a slightly different direction...<br/></p>\n<p>On an internal level, <strong>K42</strong> is designed as one part a playable game, one part a personal test to see if my artistic abilities have advanced enough to develop something (they have!), one part a metaphorical foray into personal matters, one part me wanting to make a shooty whiz-bang ka-pow run-and-gun fun-in-the-sun <em>video game</em>,and one part a mixing bowl to toss in a lot of half-baked ideas I've had over the years.</p>\n<p>It's\u00a0an\u00a0experimental little game. But I had fun developing it. I hope you have fun playing it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/>- A whole two levels, both of them wildly different in gameplay from each other!<br/>- Two weapons, technically three if you count a unique alt-fire as a separate weapon!<br/>- No infinite-ammo fallback weapon! Make every shot count, bucko.<br/>- Original and custom art for everything!<br/>- Extensive work put into sound effects!<br/>- And also a whole bunch of BFXR to make the aforementioned customized sound effects look cheap!<br/>- Pixels! A lot of them!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Installation:</strong><br/>Kid 4 $29.99 is a completely standalone project, but currently requires a copy of Doom2.wad to run. The implementation is a little bit finnicky due to deadline stuff, and will be refined to be standalone for later releases.</p>\n<p>- Download GZDoom at https://zdoom.org/downloads<br/>- Acquire Doom or get a copy of Freedoom 2 at https://freedoom.github.io/<br/>- Extract the GZDoom files, Doom2.wad and Kid-4-$29.99.ipk3 in the same folder<br/>- Open up GZDoom, select Kid-4-$29.99.ipk3 if prompted, and play!<br/>- Configure options as needed! Alt-Fire and Use are required.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T09:25:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ea/9ea5f833b208b1d62b6228393d554527.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TerminusEst13"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
