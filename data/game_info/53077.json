It is the third entry in the King&#39;s Field series and the last one for the original PlayStation. The English language version was renumbered and retitled King&#39;s Field II, because the original King&#39;s Field was released only in Japan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-21T11:37:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7c/d7c2f51d412ec46be323118a117f29ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 508, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["FromSoftware"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["FromSoftware"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
