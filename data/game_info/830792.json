Can you make them sing the required melody?<br/><br/>I worked together with Kate Killick for this project. We wanted to create a puzzle game where music was the goal, and not a byproduct. This is what we came up with. Kate focused on the art and some level design while I focused on the development. We hope you enjoy this small collaboration project!
