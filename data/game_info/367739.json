It's built using the Godot Engine and is coded in GDScript. This took me ~10 of work. It's not very much, but please feel free to donate! (Please do...) Right now, this project is paused, but I'll come back once I get a little more support and experience.</p>\n<p>Now, this game might be a little confusing. I'll explain and give you a tutorial right now.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You code lines of code clicking the Code! button. Accumulate some code, and make a program. Sell that and with the money you have, hire someone. Now, take note that hiring someone means that you'll pay them every minute.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n\n<p>Support me on my journey at:</p>\n<p>patreon.com/bkoklu001</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T07:09:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00d/00d4ede7a8c7a2553a1ea747893009e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["bkoklu001"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
