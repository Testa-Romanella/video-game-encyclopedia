The only thing you remember is a monster that likely awaits you at its end. With nothing in your possession, you must navigate your way through enemy-filled rooms and corridors to find weapons and treasures to aid you in your escape. Luckily for you, some poor adventurers must have left their equipment behind in the chests located throughout the dungeon. Acquire firearms to fend off evil monsters and undead in an attempt to reach the exit and survive. But beware, the monster waiting at the end of the dungeon remembers you too. <br/></p>\n<p>___________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD</p>\n<p>Jump - Space\u00a0</p>\n<p>Select Weapon - Number Keys 1-5</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Click - Fire Gun</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Click - Scope In</p>\n<p>Press and Hold Space on Wall - Wall Ride</p>\n<p>Use these controls to help you navigate throughout the dungeon and aid you in fending off for yourself.<br/></p>\n<p>___________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Post Mortem: <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>What Went Right? </strong>As a team we were very committed to the original idea that we had and successfully ended up with a final product that we envisioned with only a few minor details changed. The team was overwhelmed with satisfaction when the end product was accomplished.</p>\n<p><strong>What Went Wrong?\u00a0</strong>Our team struggled the most with scheduling, it was very difficult for us to find a time to work together as we often had different availability. Another setback we faced was with GitHub. We would have difficulties merging branches and would lose progress.</p>\n<p><strong>How We Fixed It:\u00a0 </strong>With these setbacks we found solutions to these problems with communication, team members often communicated their updates through Discord to make sure no one was in the dark.<strong> </strong>For out GitHub difficulties, we solved this by deciding to work on one branch at a time. We would communicate with each other when we would work on the branch so that no one else would work on it during this time to avoid any issues and then communicate when we were done working to give the opportunity for another team member to work on it.</p>\n<p><strong>What We Learned From This: </strong>The most important detail that we grasped was the importance of communication as a team. In the beginning it was hard to figure out where to start, but once we did, we were able to work on it at a gradual pace. Respectively we also reinforced our abilities in our areas such as level design, programming, art and sound. <br/></p>\n<p>___________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Levinthal (Co-Producer/Level Designer):\u00a0\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>Daniel will be the main level designer/producer for the game.
