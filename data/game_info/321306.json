Gold.<br/><br/>A premium re-imagining of a previous AIU game, with just a few small differences: a nice big gold button to press and a pleasing \"cha-ching\" sound effect every 100 points.<br/><br/>Everything is deliberate. Gameplay has been stripped down to the basic elements - interact with the button, observe your score score increase, but don't dither too long or you'll reset to zero. Purity of esscence.<br/><br/>I believe this pure game is worth nearly $200. Who are you to tell me otherwise?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74f2d63646b2b5f3f3a2512a7cf696a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexander In Uganda"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alexander In Uganda"], "esrb_rating": null}
