Super Crush is my entry this time, and I'm super happy with what I produced this time around, accomplishing everything within my initial scope and then some. I'm well aware that the art is rather lacking, but that's the best you can do when you're a programmer by trade :rolling_eyes:. The point of the game is to move the crates found on each level into a horizontal line. But beware, every move you make, you are running out of space. Two crushers will get closer and closer until you eventually run out of moves and are flattened between them. Solving the puzzle will prevent them from closing in on you, and allowing you to advance to the next level.</p>\n<p><strong>PLAY IN FULLSCREEN MODE (</strong>UI elements make be wonky otherwise)<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- WASD or Arrow Keys: Movement<br/>- Z: Reset the puzzle if you make a mistake.<br/>- Spacebar: Retry/Continue a level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83ebefc0cc6f2693fb9e000e00188ea3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Amatwiedle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
