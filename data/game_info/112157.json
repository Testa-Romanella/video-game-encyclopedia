The assignment for this project was simply to take a game from 2010, and translate it into the style and gameplay of an arcade game from the 1980s or 1990s.</p>\n<p>I really wanted to work with Mass Effect 2 in this project because it is one of my all-time favorite games, as well as pay homage to my instructor, who worked on the Mass Effect Trilogy. It took me a while to figure out how I wanted to translate the gameplay, but after some research, I thought a beat em' up such as The Simpsons would be a perfect fit.</p>\r\nProject\u00a0Highlights\r\n<ul><li>2 game modes</li><li>Enemy pathfinding using the A* algorithm</li><li>My first real attempt at custom art. The characters designs were taken from a reddit user named wolfentir's DeviantArt account, which has since been deactivated, and modified to \r\nmy own taste. I also had to create the animations for walking and \r\npunching. The level art was made by myself.</li></ul><p>I want to do more with the project in the future. I'll be looking at adding things like:</p><ul><li>The human reaper boss from the end of the suicide mission (cut originally due to time and pixel art talent constraints)</li><li>Special moves for each of the characters (cut originally due to time constraints)</li><li>Level select for battle arena with 3-4 maps</li><li>Better animations and world art (jumping animations)</li><li>Updates to character locomotion (wall sliding/jumping)</li></ul>\r\nChange\u00a0Log\r\n<p><strong>v1.21:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fixed players clipping out of bounds\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>v1.2:\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fixed collectors shooting infinitely in some situations</li><li>Added Medigel pickup to replenish health\r\nDropped occasionally by collectors, always by Harbinger</li><li>New balancing for 1 player arcade mode - less enemies, more time between spawns (2-4 players have the same difficulty)</li><li>Minor logic and AI fixes\r\n</li></ul>\r\nNOTE: THIS GAME REQUIRES 1-4 CONTROLLERS!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d14/d1475ef0ea8aa12f1f7b8ac6dd1bc82a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adamfranco"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
