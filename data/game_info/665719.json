A stormy day was all it took to break their\u00a0ship\u00a0down, and the crew with\u00a0nowhere to go was forced to embrace the life of castaway!\u00a0They have\u00a0to cooperate in order to gather resources and\u00a0build their way out of near-certain death. But, pirates they wouldn't be if they didn't take this opportunity to settle some old scores!\u00a0As one of them, you will have to cooperate,\u00a0betray and watch out for betrayal. Moreover, there seems to be added to the crew, a \"one too many\" pirate that wants\u00a0nothing good for either of you.</p>\n<p>You must be connected to <strong>steam</strong> to be able to play in <strong>multiplayer</strong> !</p>\n\n<p><strong>CocoCorp TEAM</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Devs:</strong>\u00a0Vincent Debuissi, Nicolas Puissant</p>\n<p><strong>Artists:</strong>\u00a0Laura Houdi\u00e9, Th\u00e9o Saragas, Kevin Michel</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds:</strong>\u00a0Florian Dumas</p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks:</strong> Elioth Benard, Maxime Jumelle, Julien Herr, William Moiriat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T07:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a8/4a8aa6b36eb087322d7c6b8616755cfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 412, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CocoCorp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
