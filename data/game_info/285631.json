Your jumps recharge each time you hit something with your cube, that'd be a wall, an enemy, or your own shots.</p>\n<p>You can shoot in any direction you want (Except if you haven't found a power up yet), and switch your recoil mode, thrust or no thrust, your shots will make you fly or not move you at all, and they will bounce on walls up to three times.</p>\n<p>You have a power bar representing your current health, but also your shoot power, and it can raise up to 5 if you destroy blue power-ups.</p>\n<p>You can use 1 power unit to slow down time for 15 seconds and be able to understand more the quick situations going on and react.</p>\n\n<p>A full game would have a lot of levels, score ratings, online leader\u00a0boards and a level editor for community levels, and probably many speed\u00a0runners x)</p>\n\r\nCommands\r\n<p>- Space / Right trigger : Jump<br/>- QD / Left joystick\u00a0 X : Horizontal movements<br/>- ZS / Left joystick Y : Plan switch<br/>- Left click / Right bumper : Shoot (Requires at least 1 power)<br/>- Mouse / Arrow keys / Right joystick : Aim<br/>- Right click\u00a0/ Left trigger : Switch thrust mode (Requires at least 1 power)<br/>- A / Left bumper : Bullet time (Requires at least 2 power)</p>\n<p>I HIGHLY recommend playing with a controller, it's jump too hard to aim via mouse in the current demo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:57:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/218d31f4be9324eef1f265efec8b6058.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaldrin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
