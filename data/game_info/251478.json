Then get ready for something new, something that is much more of a tactical shooter than the average shmup you have seen before!</p>\n<p>Just like in a dual stick shooter you have one control to move your ship and another one to set bullet direction of the ship&#39;s primary weapons (cannon, plasma gun, death ray, etc.). In addition to that tapping enemies will aim and fire your ship&#39;s secondary weapons (rocket, fusion gun, etc.) and two finger touch is used for mega bombs. There are tons of ways to customize your ship, RPG elements and more to affect your gaming experience significantly. Top that with 9 amazing levels filled with swarms of enemies, big bosses, smooth animation, fantastic sound tracks and sound FX and you&#39;ll get hours of non-stop, fast-paced thrilling gameplay.</p>\n<p>Story</p>\n<p>Somewhere far far away in the Pixel Universe, in the depths of a Designer&#39;s Mind lies a Paper World, where everything is cut out of paper. A beautiful planet, where all its inhabitants live in peace and harmony. However once an unsuccessful paper creation is forgotten by the stressed-out Designer, here comes the fearful Black Hole that absorbs and destroys everything related to that creation. Obviously, the poor little Paper creatures don\u2019t want to see their end.
