Choose to take on waves of ferocious enemies as a lone wolf (spider), or join forces with your friends, then challenge them to a duel afterwards so you can gleefully watch them do a neat trick before they launch themselves face-first into the lava.<br/><br/><h3>FEATURES</h3><br/><br/><strong>Battle it out, have fun, or\u2026 uh... suffer</strong><br/><br/>What mode are you in the mood for today? Cut down waves of enemies or create modded duels; fight one-on-one or try to make it through the challenges\u2014then try again, and again, and again\u2026 Alternatively, you can just spend your time putting cute hats on the spiders.<br/><br/><strong>Play alone or get the squad in on the action</strong><br/><br/>Sure, you can play with your friends: co-op or against each other, local or online\u2026 But what if you don't have any friends? Don't worry, we're here to give you a big hug and let you know that there are tons of solo modes, too. And if you feel like making friends so you have someone to play with, use the quick search to find random opponents or visit our Discord channel. We've got everyone covered. <br/><br/><strong>Limitless potential for gravity-defying stunts</strong><br/><br/>The physics system here is so much more than just swinging from webs: do a somersault, push off of your opponent, swing your sword 360\u00b0, get stuck, wiggle your way out, and deal the killing blow as you land on your enemy's head. Now imagine all that but in zero gravity (yes, there's a level like that!).<br/><br/><strong>Combine different survival tactics</strong><br/><br/>Each arena has its own unique features, and while some may help you, others will bring the pain. You're welcome to come up with a strategy in the beginning and stick to it, but you don't have to\u2014just let inertia and random chance make your gameplay unpredictable.<br/><br/><strong>Crush your enemies with a mind-blowing variety of weapons</strong><br/><br/>Use shotguns, rocket launchers, mines, and single-bladed or double-bladed laser swords to slash, crush, blow up and\u2026 oh, hang on, there's something else\u2026 it only takes one hit to kill in this game, which means that with certain weapons you might be offing yourself along with your enemies. We just figured we'd mention that, ya know.<br/><br/><strong>Customize your spiders</strong><br/><br/>There are plenty of default colors available and you can earn hats by unlocking achievements (to make things more interesting, we suggest you try and find them yourself).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Have we mentioned that these SPIDERS\u2026 wait for it\u2026 HAVE LASER SWORDS?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T08:52:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bee/beea5f46e8243fba43fdfec0504703ff.jpg", "website": "https://www.spiderheck.com/", "rating": 3.8, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 152, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 10, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 67, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neverjam"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild"], "esrb_rating": null}
