You need to hurry to collect all the necessary ingredients to make a hamburger for a customer. Bring each ingredient to a cooker. Be careful that if you pick up an ingredient while having another one, the new ingredient replaces whatever you have right now! Also, towards the end of the game, the ingredients needed are hidden. Try to make a good guess!</p>\n<p>If you are struggling with a certain level but want to try out all the levels, simply press Enter key so as\u00a0to skip to the next level. (I don't recommend it since the game becomes too easy that way.) There are total of five levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Arrow keys: move<br/>Ctrl: attack<br/>Space bar: jump<br/>Z: pick up</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-18T00:38:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c28/c28490dc38ee5f7a88ba0e4e970bf9c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heejin Jang"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
