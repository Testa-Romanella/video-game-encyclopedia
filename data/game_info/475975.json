{"id": 475975, "slug": "isle-of-the-crown-demo", "name": "Isle of the Crown (Demo)", "name_original": "Isle of the Crown (Demo)", "description": "WHAT TO EXPECT\r\n<p>- A 1v1 Isle to conquer your friends on.</p>\n<p>- A small assortment of units that you can use to out-royal your enemies.</p>\n<p>- A selection of customizations for your banner on the Isle.</p>\n<p>- And of course, the fun of gaining the crown after expunging your rival from the Isle.</p>\n\r\nA FEW NOTES\r\n<p><strong>Controller-Only:</strong></p>\n<p>Due to a planned future feature, controllers are the only current available input that I will allow. Once that additional feature is added in the full game, I will also be adding it here\u00a0since it uses the current arsenal of cards that will be available to you in this Demo.</p>\n<p><strong>No Online</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<p>Due to my limitations as a newer developer, this game does not feature any online play. As much as I wish it did, I can't put it in. But, I am currently trying to see how I can implement it into the game, but networking with games is a very complicated endeavor. So, eventually I will put it in, but I can't say any time soon.</p>\n<p>Though, if you get the Free Steam DEMO version, you <strong>do\u00a0</strong>get access to its useful \"Remote Play Together\", which you can use to play with friends on Steam; just so you know. But, if you use Itch's version, you can still enjoy the game with a friend locally; like a game of Chess, Checkers, or any other boardgame.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T05:44:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61e/61e9945d860c477cbce85c91dbc2c93b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Devious_Oatmeal"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
