Your goal is to destroy other pirates. Simple enough. Grab the ammo and shoot those bastards!<br/><br/>Game is in early prototype stage. I've planned on adding many things, only time will tell if it is possible.\u00a0 Main future features will be listed here:\u00a0 https://trello.com/b/ttnlSx1x with key notes such as local and online multiplayer. <br/><br/>Please bear in mind that <strong>Xbox compatible controller </strong>is required to play! I will add support for keybaord and mouse ASAP as it is priority to get better and unified input system in version 0.2. <br/><br/>Big part of Pirate's Keel is also open-source, you can check out my repo here - https://github.com/konradp/PiratesPublic  so feel free to lurk around. <br/><br/>Controls are listed in help section of the game, but here are additional keys for debugging purposes:\u00a0<br/>- M key - mutes/unmutes music<br/>- H key - hides GUI<br/>- F key - activates/deactivates Free cam mode. In this mode you can pan your camera using right mouse button . Move using WSAD, and using QE to control altitude. Also Ctrl modifies the speed of free cam. <br/><br/>System Requirements:<br/>Intel i3 3rd gen or equivalent<br/>4GB of Ram<br/>1GB of VRam on GPU<br/>Appx 1.5GB of space<br/>Xbox compatible controller, at least for now<br/><br/>See you on the open sea!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T03:36:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ce/3ceecd73fa519bdcbe74ddd15eb9b475.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Check Engine Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
