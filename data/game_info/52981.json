Unlike previous Goemon games, which have used sprites or 3-D models for the characters, the characters are now represented by pre-rendered CGI, giving them a quasi-3-D look. Also, Yae is featured in her outfit that first appeared in Mononoke Suguroku.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:11:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/671c94341b14316342940ee710670869.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 18, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Now Production", "Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
