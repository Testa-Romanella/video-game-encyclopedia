The cat destroyed everything so they moved it to the basement. The kitty didn't like that so he pooped in my friends guitar case. We were in middle school and just learned to play guitar so the only logical thing to do was make a song about it. 20 years later, I made a game based on that song.</p><p><strong>Note: In no way is this a serious game. I made this as a joke for friends. Please take all content with a grain of salt.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/658e02181478e31dcfccfd319095e6e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pixelshot Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
