The game currently features multiple weapons, polished gunplay, a fleshed out menu system and an array of options for the ideal experience.</p>\n<p>This project is still relatively small,\u00a0because I've been focused less on simply adding in lots of features, and more on refining and polishing what features are already present so I can show it off in a portfolio. However, I am continuously working on new mechanics to add, to turn it from a mere prototype into an engaging gameplay experience (I plan on eventually creating a full singleplayer campaign with a strong story focus).</p>\n<p>Credits are included in the download, and controls are explained in\u00a0the game\u00a0itself. Only keyboard and mouse inputs are presently supported, but gamepad support is incredibly high on the list of priorities. Please comment with criticisms or to point out any bugs I've missed!</p>\n<p>Github repository:\u00a0https://github.com/CptnFabulous/FPS_Mark_Two</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:33:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b9/1b9725f269c2758fe691fa68455b45d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CptnFabulous"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
