It features classic CGA graphics (with a twist) and classic PC Speaker sounds mixed with modern music.</strong><br/><br/>From the start you can pick either Open World Mode or Story Mode. The Open World Mode offers non-engaging fun during which you can listen to podcasts or music without being fully distracted, though should you delve deep into it there\u2019s plenty to find and unlock, including difficult-to-discover easter eggs. Story Mode offers a challenging and thought-provoking platforming experience, and is recommended for experienced gamers who have played Open World Mode for at least a few hours.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-29T10:04:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16fed4bc8b62817a3fd6ab3e493e962f.jpg", "website": "http://sektorz.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The SektorZ", "Radoslav Minkov"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["The SektorZ Network"], "esrb_rating": null}
