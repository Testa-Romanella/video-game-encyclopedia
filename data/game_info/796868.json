Movement is fast, combat is simple but punishing, and deep exploration is required to proceed. Everything is hidden, from special items to entire areas.</p>\n<p>You play as an anthropomorphic rabbit girl with a multitude of different weapons and abilities, given assignments by the last monolithic mega empire on Earth. You must help them create a better future for everyone. Mutant organisms are corrupting the main land, the infrastructure supporting their colonies is failing, and there is no sole director for free agents. The Executive Council wants you to prove your worth by completing their tasks.</p>\n<p>Trek through dilapidated swamps and abandoned cities, explore sewer systems and ancient ruins, and prepare yourself to rid the environment of these invasive malignant organisms. Through this, you may prevent the world from being corrupted further, while uncovering the secret of the creatures from the Spirit Ocean. <br/></p>\r\nWhat is in this demo?\r\n\n<p>Keep in mind this is a prototype -- only basic gameplay and visual elements have been implemented.</p>\n<p>A handful of levels have been included, two objective based, one is a speed trial. There's also an \"arena\" that spawns enemies in a loop.</p>\n<p>The only ability available at the moment is \"high-jump\". Only a couple of weapons have particles and sounds.</p>\n<p>Everything shipped here is in a completely raw and unfinished state,\u00a0 more updates are to come at a later date.
