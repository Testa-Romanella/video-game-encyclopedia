Part of this idea comes from the imagination of thermodynamics. And when more active objects gather together, the power of the whole group will become stronger.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed by myself and took 48 hours (submitted 1 minute before the deadline). BGS uses Adobe's free authorized resources, the algorithm part is implemented before. Two days are mainly spent on gameplay and UI. It tooks more time than I thought, so the game parameters are not balanced, and there is no actual game difficulty (I only took 2 minutes to pass it). Some levels that were expected to have more objects were not included, including the rock that occupies the place of the letter O on the cover. In addition, there is no time to adjust the particle system, the animation of entering the DOOR is not distinguished from the animation of death, and the animation of the character entering the DOOR is relatively rough. This my first time to submit a work on Game Jam, so be it. There will be time to optimize later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:40:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20f/20f071914fdbd0c2c5f314bb9223c2b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["umbra_onovich"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
