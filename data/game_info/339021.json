{"id": 339021, "slug": "boxgun", "name": "BoxGun", "name_original": "BoxGun", "description": "<p>A first person 3D platformer with a shooting/building mechanic used for navigating the level and completing puzzles. Made to demonstrate the\u00a0limited lifespan ranged block placing mechanic. Also contains some additional puzzles which demonstrate other interesting platformer/puzzle mechanics that make use of a shooting gun/ranged tool.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blocks can be shot to build across or up to platforms and over dangerous obstacles. A slow moving projectile is shot from the players gun which creates a block at the point of impact.\u00a0Since the blocks have a limited lifespan this creates a level of difficulty because the player will fall if a block they are standing on disappears, potentially leading to the player dying and returning to their last check point if they fall between platforms or onto a dangerous obstacle. Uses standard 1st person shooter controls (click, space, and wasd). Various puzzles contain idiosyncratic mechanics (eg shoot to destroy existing blocks rather than create new ones) but instructions are provided for each puzzle individually.</p>\n<p>Made over the course of many months but only worked on at very irregular intervals. Background music is\u00a0also made by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T05:22:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9a/c9a0483e06225f7a66d0339246c7f835.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["lemon_squeezy"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
