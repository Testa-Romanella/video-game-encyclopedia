In this Clicker Game I added Acheivments, Leaderboards, Costumes and a Costume Pack.\u00a0 This is my first Game published on\u00a0Itch.io, and I am happy about it.</p>\n<p>The art for each achievment and names for each acheivment is funny and makes sense.. hopefully. The music was made by\u00a0\u00a0David Renda on the Royalty Free 8-Bit Background Music Downloads website. Heres the link:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/8-bit-music/6\u00a0 They provide great 8 bit music.</p>\n<p>By the way, This game took a little bit of inspiration by Cookie Clicker. I added the Hotdogs falling out of the sky and added 2 buildings (Download the game to know the buildings names!)</p>\n<p>Thats it for Hotdog Simulator</p>\n<p>My next game is coming soon so stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Have a Great time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T16:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d23/d23a56b888bce8d7d382d4aa46e188c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["LukDevGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
