How can I sign up?</strong></p>\n<p>Applications to be added to this game will be open while this game is in development (so right now!). For any BFC members who want to be added to the BFC Playground, please submit an application here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/1Dz8dttLAYg579BU6</p>\n<p><strong>Q2. Do you really get questions at all?</strong></p>\n<p>No, but here are they are anyway. :)</p>\n<p><strong>Q3. Is this the full game?</strong></p>\n<p>No, the game with all it's game modes has not been created yet. At this point in time, only the memory game mode has been created.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4. What is the BFC?</strong></p>\n<p>The BFC is the name of the community that has been created surrounding the twitch streamer \"<strong>brodie</strong>\". You can find us at https://www.twitch.tv/brodie</p>\n<p><strong>Q5. What gave you this idea?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to show my gratitude and appreciation for the amazing community that is the BFC. So I had the idea to create a game that would include any voluntary BFC members to be added to the minigames that now exist within the <strong>BFC Playground</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6. What are all the game modes?</strong></p>\n<p>The game modes that I plan to add include:</p>\n<p><em>- Memory Game:</em> Incorporates Easy (2x3), Medium (3x4) and Hard (4x5) difficulties, with the difficulty increasing in relation to\u00a0the amount of tiles that you have to match. The profile picture and name of the member will be shown and the player has to match them according to what they think goes together. There is also a sudden death version that will not allow any mistakes to be made.</p>\n<p><em>- Profile Picture Guesser:</em> The player is given the profile picture of a BFC member and they have to guess what their username is. This is a quick-fire game, where the objective is to see how many matches the player can get in the allocated time slots. This game mode will also have an Easy (1min), Medium (45sec) and Hard\u00a0(30sec) difficulties alongside a sudden death version.</p>\n<p><em>- Twitch\u00a0Username Guesser:</em>\u00a0Similar to the Profile Picture Guesser, but instead, you are shown the username of a BFC member and you have to choose which profile picture is theirs. This game mode will also\u00a0have an Easy (1min), Medium (45sec) and Hard\u00a0(30sec) difficulties alongside a sudden death version.</p>\n<p><em>- Higher or Lower Follower Age:</em> The player is given the username and profile picture of a BFC member and the player has to guess how long the given user has been following the streamer \"<strong>brodie</strong>\". The objective for the player is to guess the follower age of the twitch user in as least amount of attempts as possible.\u00a0This game mode will\u00a0also\u00a0have an Easy (7 attempts), Medium (5\u00a0attempts) and Hard\u00a0(3\u00a0attempts) difficulties alongside a sudden death version.</p>\n\n<p>If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions involving the game, please submit them here:</p>\n<p>https://forms.gle/V5hhYrkAUCKtv7wp6<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T05:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b96b1c9c155edff172b3c0a119d12f90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Andrew Youssef"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
