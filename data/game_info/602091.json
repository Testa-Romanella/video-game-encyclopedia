At least I had a lot of fun developing it, even if I have to admit I underestimated the workload and got quite under pressure in the end - but it was a great experience for my first jam :-)<br/><br/>There might be bugs. In case you can't move anymore (or anything else), just, uhm...kill yourself. In the game. The player. Also I can only hope all dialog leads to something, hah.</p>\n<p>There are two different endings, and yea most of the dialog is relatively unique, soooo it ABSOLUTELY is worth playing about 100 hours. At least ;-)</p>\n<p>Free Assets used:</p>\n<p>Ansimuz Sunnyland Assets<br/>Cainos Pixel Art Platformer<br/>Brackeys 2D Mega Pack<br/>Sound Effects from freesound.org<br/>Also inspired by Brackes GameJam Date Night Title<br/></p>\n<p>-&gt; All converted to Black and White<br/></p>\n<p>Paid Assets used:<br/><br/>Pixelcrushers Dialogue System (use this if you have dialog in your game!)<br/>Mirza Beig Effects Pack<br/>Music all by Dark Fantasy Studio<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:28:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/099/0990013fbcd9c74865522133dce82e5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TomsTales"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
