Once you let the planes intercept the (ILS) approach path in front of a runway, they transfer to the control tower, and then you score points. As long as you make no mistakes, your score and the amount of traffic will keep rising. Find out how many flights you can manage to control at a time. Or, you can choose to limit the traffic rate at a fixed level, for a relaxed gameplay.<br/><br/>The graphics are minimal, just like a real radar display, but the underlying mechanics are detailed and polished. Compared to other games in the genre, this game combines much of the realism of hardcore simulators, with the casual style of arcade ATC games. The game has been updated many times over the last couple of years, bringing more realism.<br/><br/>The sim offers four airports, each with specific characteristics. And the random generated traffic will give you all sorts of different situations, providing many hours of gameplay.<br/><br/><strong>airports</strong><br/><ul><li>Amsterdam (EHAM)<br/></li><li>Atlanta (KATL)<br/></li><li>Frankfurt (EDDF)<br/></li><li>London (EGLL)</li></ul>key features<ul><li>four large airports, each with multiple runway configurations<br/></li><li>realistic pilot behavior<br/></li><li>adaptive, randomly generated traffic<br/></li><li>pilot speech<br/></li><li>easy to play, by mouse, touch or keyboard</li></ul><br/><strong>realism</strong><br/><ul><li>wind and storms<br/></li><li>go-arounds<br/></li><li>restricted areas<br/></li><li>parallel approaches<br/></li><li>occasional emergencies<br/></li><li>secondary nearby airports<br/></li><li>wake turbulence<br/></li><li>delays<br/></li><li>holdings</li></ul><br/>Although the controls are relatively easy, this game may have a learning curve for new players unfamiliar with aviation.
