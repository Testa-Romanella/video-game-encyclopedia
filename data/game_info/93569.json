{"id": 93569, "slug": "empires-and-tribes-demo", "name": "Empires and Tribes Demo", "name_original": "Empires and Tribes Demo", "description": "<p>Empires and Tribes is a medieval real-time strategy game being played in first person view. Thus the player is encouraged to quit the passive bird-eye view, which is common in strategy games, and to become an active part of the world he creates.  It is your duty to ensure the survival of your people, to extend the settlement, to fund research and to establish a strong military to defend yourself against rivaling kingdoms. Assign workers to gather resources, hunt deer, forge tools and weapons or to construct new buildings. Take charge yourself and help chopping trees, weaving clothes, baking bread,\u2026 whatever needs to be done in your village. Satisfy your inhabitants needs and unlock new buildings like the copper forge, the bow maker, the monastery, the stables,\u2026 and watch your village turning into the economic and cultural centre of the region, maybe even hitting the size of an imperial city. Take advantage of your economic power, start the construction of a keep, train soldiers, archers and knights, declare war on your enemies and coordinate the assault on their towns and castles.<br/></p>\n<p>Features like AI, combat system, saving function and the story line are not included in this Demo version. As we're still in development we would be more than happy about feedback, improvement suggestions, bug reports and more! You can help us creating the game you always wanted.
