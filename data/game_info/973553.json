{"id": 973553, "slug": "rave-gazebo", "name": "Rave Gazebo", "name_original": "Rave Gazebo", "description": "This dance-interactive VR album contains six songs. Each song has 6 layers of pre-composed music, and when you flail with your hands the direction of the hand's movement switches to a different layer of music. Your gestures also interact with the environment, tossing out physics objects like lobsters or disco balls, or sometimes just lightning that glitches out anything it touches.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith groundbreaking visuals that take advantage of stencil shaders to create portals and glitch effects, this album abandons realism and leans into the power of Virtual Reality to create a world impossible to replicate outside of a VR headset.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are no points in Rave Gazebo and you cannot play it wrong. There is no objective other than to play around remixing the music and interacting with the environment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T03:35:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/397/39787a7cea3d3ab4d75d5363cbef678c.jpg", "website": "https://www.gosborneaudio.com/rave-gazebo", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gregory Osborne"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rave Gazebo"], "esrb_rating": null}
