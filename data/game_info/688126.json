Could someone have been buried alive? You need to remember the sound of the bell that woke you up and try\u00a0 to figure out which grave has that bell. Once you have it figured out, you need to dig up the grave and... let's just hope you got it right!</p>\n<p>You only get one shot at digging up a grave, so wrong or right, once you've dug up a\u00a0 grave, press ESCAPE to restart the game anew.</p>\n\n<p>Made for the IGS <em>Jamoween II - The Jammening </em>game jam over a period of 8 days, for the theme <strong>Buried Alive!</strong></p>\n<p>Made in Unity.
