Walk, climb and glide to discover unique and versatile landscapes across the planet.<h3>Terrain Generation</h3>Drift Abyss prioritizes creating a completely unique environment for each user and playthrough. To achieve this, all generated biomes receive their own \u201cgene\u201d containing modular pieces of program that can mutate and evolve. Explore to uncover more crazy and possibly beautiful points of interest.<h3>Movement</h3>Drift Abyss experiments with an immersive, full-body locomotion system. Swing your arms to walk, grip onto any surface to climb, and physically flap with your arms to fly. Break a sweat without even noticing them while discovering places.<h3>Future plans</h3>Drift Abyss is still under heavy development! There are many planned upcoming features and anyone can contribute to our bucket list of future content.<h3>Gallery of Drift Abyss development history</h3><br/><strong>July 2021</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>November 2021</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>June 2022</strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T08:27:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6adc6086df599a1f2f4396f2f1070f80.jpg", "website": "https://8legs.jp/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["8LEGS.JP"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["8LEGS.JP"], "esrb_rating": null}
