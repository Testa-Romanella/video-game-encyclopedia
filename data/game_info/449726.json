I mean, who wouldn't want to be a real-life flash?</p>\n<p>Well, unfortunately I don't have the ability to provide you with mystical powers that enable you to complete chores in a blink of an eye (I wish)<br/>So I took this concept and done the next best thing - I created a game following these same notions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone knows that the faster the speed of an object, the slower the speed of its surroundings, so the same principal applies in this game. As the ball of light energy is released from the sun, the aim of this game is to guide it through the solar system and make it past the last planet (Neptune, not Pluto  ). To do this, you must simply not stop moving, as the closer you are to the speed of light, the slower time will pass around you, enabling you to travel further.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Watch out for the red meteorites floating around, as hitting these causes you to momentarily slow down, thus making space time pass normally. Collect the glistering light orbs when they appear, as these will give you an extra 2 seconds of light energy!</p>\n<p><strong><em>P.S This game not only serves for fun, but also for educational purposes, as all distances and speeds are accurate to scale!  </em><br/></strong><br/>Enjoy the ride!</p>\r\nHow\u00a0to Play\r\n\r\nWASD\r\n<p> - Move\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\r\nEsc\r\n<p> - Quit/Go back to Menu<br/></p>\n\n\r\nF \r\n<p>- Restart the level (only works if gameover)<br/></p>\n\n\r\nCredit\r\n\r\nAssets\r\n<p>Grey Rock - MegaScan<br/>Red Rock - MegaScan</p>\n<p>Planet Textures -\u00a0https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/<br/></p>\r\nBackground Music\r\n<p>Out There - https://opengameart.org/content/space-music-out-there</p>\n<p>Sound Phenomenon Fantasy Orchestra - Free Permanent Collection Unreal Engine MarketPlace<br/></p>\n<p>UI sound - https://www.kenney.nl/</p>\n\r\nFonts\r\n<p>Falcon - https://www.1001fonts.com/facon-font.html<br/>Bimasakti - https://www.1001fonts.com/bimasakti-font.html<br/>Supercomputer - https://www.1001fonts.com/supercomputer-font.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T04:13:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0f5860f71b27a1bfc3e815a33adad08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kelvin A'Ribeiro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
