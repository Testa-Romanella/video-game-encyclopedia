It is written in C# and utilizes OpenGL through the OpenTK library. Content for a game is currently defined via XMLs, PNG files and OBJ files.</p><p>The engine has had very little testing on machines outside of my own, so please do report any issues that you encounter. This will greatly help me in fixing any bugs. </p><p>Currently only the battle module can be tested. Will work on getting documentation uploaded soon.</p><p>My Youtube Channel<br/></p><ul><li>Menu Controls: Arrow Keys, Enter, Escape</li><li>Battle Controls: Arrow Keys, WASD (Camera), Enter, Escape</li><li>Skills<ul><li>Slime<ul><li>Goo Bomb - Delayed ranged AOE attack</li><li>Goo Burst - AOE attack, heals unit slightly</li><li>Goo Revive - Revives dead unit</li><li>Goo Touch - Inflicts poison on unit</li></ul></li><li>Mantis\r\n<ul><li>Sweep Slash - Angled AOE attack</li></ul></li><li>Shroom\r\n<ul><li>Spore Scatter - AOE Poison</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49b/49be68a7f6b8e8527a8b0be09703ef66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["HowDoGameDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
