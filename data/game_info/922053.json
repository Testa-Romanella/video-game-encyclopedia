Roots will split periodically, and you continue to guide ALL root ends!\u00a0<br/>Root ends in the guiding area will generally grow towards that direction. Left click to focus the guide, shrinking the area but making it more influential. Be careful as this uses energy, which regenerates over time when not in use.\u00a0<br/>Roots cannot grow out of the ground or through rocks. If all your root ends stop growing, it's game over.\u00a0<br/>Collect all the water resources with your root ends to complete the level. Unlock and complete all the levels to complete the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T03:24:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe4/fe492bed19fa99e317b59928d1455077.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Games By Kylie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
