This one was for the VIm Jam. It's a simple game where you collect broken satellites and sell them to earth for money and then upgrade your ship.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I forgot to put in the how to play section that you can press the tab key to come back to the title screen. This resets your game though. Also there is no exit button to quit the game because I intended for this to be played in browser but it didn't work for some reason. You'll just have to end the process through task manager or something, sorry.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:02:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88a/88a83910974dcaa53da388eddceb6aa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aboykiy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
