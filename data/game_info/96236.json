Created by 49 students and 3 professors at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Stout, <em>Harvey </em>will allow users to enter the virtual space and meet historical characters, such as Lorenzo Dow Harvey, who was president at the college from 1903-1922. <br/><br/>Users will also be able to interact with important objects, accomplish mini-missions and relive the significant history of University of Wisconsin-Stout.<br/><br/>http://harveygame.com/ <br/></p><br/>MEET THE CHARACTERS<p>We have recreated seven special characters in which the game user is able to interact with during gameplay. The characters selected to be recreated in the game were: Verne Fryklund, the 3rd president of Stout; Bill Neubauer, a beloved elevator operator; Cal Peters, a Works Progress Administration artist in the 1930's; Lillian Froggatt, the head librarian who served for 31 years; Mary McCalmont, chemistry professor who taught courses for 40 years; Minnie Becker, the longtime president's secretary who served under four presidents; and the building namesake, Lorenzo Harvey.</p><br/>THE ENVIRONMENT<p>While characters bring the spirit of students back to life, environments are able to take the user back into time with not only historic recreated classrooms, but with interactive objects as well. Classrooms like the millinery room and textile lab are like new, and allow the user to experience turn of the century items. With the user reliving a student's daily life, they can find objects within every room that are not only historic but interesting. Don't forget to look around every corner for exciting objects while exploring!</p><br/>THE DEV TEAM<p><em>Harvey </em>is one of the biggest projects ever executed at the University of Wisconsin-Stout, by a team consisting of almost 50 people, coming from three different classes and spanning two semesters.
