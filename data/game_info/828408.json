He has traveled here to witness the skill of the most acclaimed pong player, whom he has decided, in all his omniscience, is YOU. And what better challenge to the greatest pong player in the multiverse than a game of pong against THEMSELF! The entity wont take no for an answer, and be wary, this seemingly innocent challenge may involve higher stakes than you bargained for.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first GameJam submission ever. My brain is dead. The spaghetti code I weaved to make it defied my moral principles to their core. This is more of an art piece than a game. My love of music and video games combined into some interactive music video drug trip.</p>\n<p>If you just want to see a full playthrough and are too lazy or frustrated to achieve it yourself, you can watch me do it:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>________</p>\n<p>Behind the Curtain:</p>\n<p><em>Read below to understand the mechanics better if you are struggling or are just curious.</em></p>\n<p>Every section of the game begins and ends at a natural transition point in the music. Using this you can predict when the next stage will occur.</p>\n<p>The first stage is just a warm up for you to get use to the controls, pretty straightforward. Points scored here (displayed in the pupils of the god)\u00a0don't have an immediate negative effect.</p>\n<p>The second stage is to really get your adrenaline going. This is the stage where the ball actually moves the fastest out of anywhere in the game. Meanwhile, there are meteors getting in your way. Once again though, points scored do not have an immediate negative impact.</p>\n<p>The third stage involves playing pong with the Earth. If the Earth collides with the left or right wall, it explodes, and you immediately lose.</p>\n<p>The final stage involves playing pong with a blackhole. The points scored on you in stage 1 and 2 act as the health of the god in this stage. Hitting the god with the blackhole minuses one health, and the match continues until its health has reached zero and you win!</p>\n<p>_____</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Deep-Fold\u00a0for creating the space background and planet generators I used to make the space graphics!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T18:39:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c53ed067121556c6d4675c824a6071b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["One Flow Man"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
