I called it Speed Pool. I gave myself the not-so-generous deadline of 6 days, and while I was proud of it, I was never quite satisfied. In retrospect, you weren't even playing pool. You're actually playing a single-player 8 ball. I've only played billiards once.</p>\n<p>So, for my last game of the year\u00a0(and the decade), I thought it fitting to recreate my first game of the year, with the same time constraints, only this time it would be better. One of the things that I wanted to make 100% better were the physics. They're not too accurate this time around but it's a large improvement over Speed Pool 1.</p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>\n<ul><li>Aim and charge your pool ball power with the left mouse button.\u00a0</li><li>Right click and drag in order to rotate the camera around the table.\u00a0</li><li>Scroll to zoom in.\u00a0<ul><li>I forgot to add code before the 6-day deadline to limit how far you can zoom in the camera so don't scroll\u00a0<em>too</em> far.
