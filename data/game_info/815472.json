Things were not  complicated enough, however, because your only parent got in the way  once again. So now you\u2019ll have to not only solve a crime but do it  quickly, before Unit Foxtrot destroys all your work just to hide all  traces of supernatural - <em>except that you\u2019ve known about it for a long time</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Agency might not like it, but Queenstown is <em>yours</em> now<em>.<br/></em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul><li>Customise your gender, appearance and sexuality (MC is also canonically demiromantic).\r\n</li><li><strong>Protect the city.</strong>\n</li><li>Trust no one.\r\n</li><li>Romance one out of four gender selectable ROs, the mysterious members of the Foxtrot Unit.\r\n</li><li>Play as a highly intelligent person with a natural talent for investigation.\r\n</li><li>Deal with a past mistake in the form of a very invasive ex fianc\u00e9e. \r\n</li></ul>\n<strong>Vance</strong>\n<p><em>[Gender Customisable] </em>\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The  leader of Unit Foxtrot. A cutting, serious person with a cold demeanor,  not ready to spare anyone\u2019s feeling if they\u2019re in the right. They have  hidden their gentler side for so long, now, that they themselves are  unsure if something of it still remains.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Mischa</strong>\n<p><em>[Gender Customisable] \u00a0 \u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>A  docile and introverted person, very formal with people they don\u2019t know.  They might need a lot of time to trust someone, but once they do Mischa  will let loose their sweet, most adorable side. There\u2019s something  lurking, though, behind their shy smiles and it resembles <em>fear</em>.  \r\n</p>\n<strong>Bea (Beau/Beatrice)</strong>\n<p><em>[Gender Customisable]</em> \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>A  controlled and seemingly patronising person, always ready to cut their  opponents down with a smile and a heartless remark. They might hide a  more caring side but be careful because they are quick to turn their  back on someone if they\u2019re not up to their standards.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Sierra</strong>\n<p><em>[Gender Customisable] \u00a0 \u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>A  selfless and empathetic person, for most of the time they are  respectful and kind-hearted. They feel every emotion intensely, though,  including sadness and <em>anger</em> so you\u2019ll need to be careful around them.</p>\n<em><strong>The unlockable RO </strong></em>\r\n\r\nAriel (the ex-fianc\u00e9e)\r\n<p>[Gender customizable]\r\n</p>\n<p>You love them and hate them because they think they <em>own </em>you  and you\u2019re deadly afraid that it\u2019s true. They are protective,  possessive and they make your heart ache, for better or for worse. Will  you get back into their arms?</p>\n<strong><em>Other Characters of Interest</em></strong>\n<p><strong>Rogue</strong>  (your only remaining parent): they have been absent for most of your  life, so much so that even when they\u2019re with you they feel distant.  Maybe you resent them, maybe you just crave their approval.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T06:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/619/6199ab575e18dd79d92d32aefe9020a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Queenstown Detective"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
