Game-players just force them to constantly act out the scenarios, and no characters <em>really</em> get stabbed, blown up, eaten, etc. They just clock out at the end of the day, and jump into action as soon as someone feeds a quarter in their arcade cabinet. It's a system that works perfectly.<br/></p>\n<p>Until one day, a Ghost slips Mr. Chompface some arsenic, and it all goes to hell.</p>\n<p>Use the ENTER key to begin the game. Use the ARROW KEYS to move through the maze and navigate the in-game menus.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WACF </strong>is kind of a tribute to the games of my youth, kind of a joke, kind of a creative action puzzle with multiple endings. It includes:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Maze traveling, dot-dropping, <em>Chompface-eating</em> action<br/>\u00a0- Full voice acting <em>(by me)</em><br/>\u00a0- An original, official sing-along theme song <em>(also sung by me, to a \"Frosty the Snowman\" karaoke track)</em><br/>\u00a0- Three different endings, each more challenging than the last</p><p><em>NOTE: for best performance, it's suggested you use a web browser other than Firefox.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy...!</p>\n<p><em>\"THANK YOU FOR PLAY!\" </em>[sic]<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T07:40:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df3ad89acce45cff595e93e6f01bfcaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["let-off-studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
