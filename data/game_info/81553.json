A 52-card deck is dealt in 10 cascading stacks. You can move the top card of a cascading stack to either an empty free cell or to the top of another cascading stack with top card of the same suit and one higher value. For example, 3 of clubs can be moved to a stack with top card 4 of clubs. Any value card can be moved to an empty free cell. Only Kings can be moved to an empty cascading stack.<br/><br/>NOTES: Not all games are winnable. You can reject a newly-dealt hand that looks unwinnable by clicking New Game again. If you click New Game before moving any cards, the game is not counted as a loss. Click Undo to undo one move at a time, or Start Over to undo all moves in the current game.<br/> <br/>Seahaven Towers is a trademark of Art Cabral, used with permission.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T06:14:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ae/4aefe312e8491c193845b256a8af2525_4BW27ge.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["fishdog.net"], "genres": ["Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["fishdog.net"], "esrb_rating": null}
