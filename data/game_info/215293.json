The objective was to make a game using only the Windows Forms application type.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>The game itself is a simple example of a turn based RPG. You play as a wizard and fight other wizards.\u00a0Fighting gives you experience points and gold.\u00a0Experience points help you level up which lets you allocate skill points and increases your starting health. Gold lets you buy potions and weapons.</p>\n\n<p>There's no real story to the game. You have ten opponents of different skill levels to choose from.\u00a0Like any RPG of this type, you'll need to level up to have much of a chance against the higher level opponents.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d9090ad8b449f88eee6337549ae534f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Theta and Pi Software"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
