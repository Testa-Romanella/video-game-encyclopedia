{"id": 396061, "slug": "towero", "name": "Tower\u00f8", "name_original": "Tower\u00f8", "description": "<p>\"They locked you up inside a huge tower. Every single floor is full of traps and puzzles designed to prevent you from escaping. The tower also prevents you from using black magic. The only way to leave your prison leads to a secret portal, which is located on the top of Tower\u00f8. Can you make your way back to freedom? Can you make it to the top of Tower\u00f8?\"<br/></p>\n<p>You are some kind of demon who has to escape from a tower. That's all you need to know. The gameplay is about solving different puzzles in order to proceed to the next floor. The goal is to reach the top floor. There is no need to save the game manually as the game offers an automatic save system. At the moment, the game has 10 stages and the total playing time is roughly estimated to be around 40 minutes. Maybe I'll add even more stages if you guys like what I did so far. Until then: Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T02:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/2246c1f34334a8f6ef19347a70709d09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TwoFaceGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
