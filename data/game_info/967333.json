All current season cards are shared so you can jump right into the action. Get rewarded for winning games and grow your own private collection. Currently in the Beta Season, cards and packs are limited, so gather them now, boost their visuals for added value and trade them later!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI originally wanted to create a table top card game for my kids, but figured out it would be easier to make a computer sandbox. The project eventually turned into a fully online game, packed with features and interesting mechanics. The first release of the game with 300+ Alpha Season cards came out in January 2022. The Beta Season cards were released in September 2022. Looking forward to create the Third Season cards with the help of the community!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLooking forward to challenge you on the battlefield!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T03:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bfd759563b249d4d4fe8915459c4c34.jpg", "website": "https://reaperstcg.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeoReel"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NeoReel"], "esrb_rating": null}
