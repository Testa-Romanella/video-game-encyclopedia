The terminal you possess is linked directly to source. This is where you came from. If you lose signal with source, your systems slowly corrupt until you're destroyed. The farther you go out into the world the more challenges there are, but there is also greater reward. Therefore an objective is the build outwards and expand source's signal throughout the world. Your terminal and Source OS will play a big part in your expansion.<br/> </p>\n<p> This is a purely multiplayer project. You can host a server for you and your friends through the client. If you want to play singleplayer you can set your world to closed, and change the port to one that's closed on your network.</p>\n\n<p><strong>System Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>OS: Windows 10<br/>\r\nDirectX: Version 12<br/>\r\nProcessor: Tested on Intel i7 3820<br/>\r\nGraphics: Tested on NVIDIA GTX 1060<br/>\r\nMemory: 8GB RAM<br/>\r\nStorage: 512 MB available space<br/>\r\nInput: Keyboard and Mouse w/ partial XInput support<br/>\r\nNote: You can likely use a slightly lesser CPU/GPU and still run the game fine</p>\n\n<p>There are currently limited features in the world, but updates will come out often, so feel free to keep tabs on this page until auto updating is in place.
