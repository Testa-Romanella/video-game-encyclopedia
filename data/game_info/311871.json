Its quick and 'speedy' play keeps both players pleasantly on the edge. Racing to get rid of all cards first, players can finish a game within less than a few minutes. Speed and accuracy is the key.<br/><br/>Speed card has been a long time preferred card game to play between two players.<br/><br/>The rules are fairly simple and can be taught to young children who possess basic math skills.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt five cards to form a hand, and 15 cards face down to form a draw pile. Two stacks of five cards, placed face down on each side between the players, serve as replacement piles.<br/><br/>Two cards are placed face up in the center between the replacement piles. Using cards from their hand, the players must simultaneously place cards one above or one below on top of the center stacks. For example, a pile with a six on top may have a five or a seven placed on. As there is no concept of turns, one can drop multiple cards simultaneously. Jokers are used as wild cards.<br/>Ace is both a high and low card, considered one value above a King as well as one below a two, so that the cards form a looping sequence. Players will always have five cards. Whenever the number of cards in a player's hands drops below five, cards are dealt to the player to make them five cards, until that player's draw pile is empty.<br/>When both players run out of options for play automatically card flip from the side piles onto the top of the central stacks. If these piles become depleted, the central stacks are shuffled individually and are placed face-down as new side piles from which cards can be flipped.<br/><br/>Forget taking turns! The one player who stays alert for the duration of the game has chances of winning it more in this game where fast reflexes with a cool head plays an important role.<br/><br/>=== Speed Card Features ===<br/><br/>1.
