I unfortunately didn't have alot of time this month to commit to the jam, but I'm happy I was able to get a simple boss with a few move sets working. I programmed the game in Rust. I used a library called Macroquad to do simple stuff like draw pixels and get keyboard input, but I did almost everything else in my own code.\u00a0 All of the art was created before the jam for other projects. I'm glad I could participate in Boss Rush Jam!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Move: LEFT and RIGHT</li><li>Dash: PressDOWN while holding LEFT or RIGHT</li><li>Jump: SPACE</li><li>Fire: X</li></ul>\n<p>Be sure to use your wall jump to dodge the boss's attacks!</p>\n<p>github:\u00a0https://github.com/mmducasse/makeshift</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T12:27:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/577/5772b32e43a0c7e89b27d9cbe3a0c399.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mattmd"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
