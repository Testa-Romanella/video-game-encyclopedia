The Green Team is comprised of Omegalodon, a 100-foot shark monster, and the Enviros, equipped with a healing beam. The game plays like a backward tower-defense game, but with free-roaming capability and fast-paced, realtime action.<br/><br/>Omegalodon's objective is a nuclear containment dome at the city center. The round will end if it is destroyed, the timer reaches zero, or if Omegalodon dies.Features<br/><ul><li> Fully destructible environments<br/></li><li> Dozens of drivable vehicles including helicopters, cargo ships, and jets<br/></li><li> 30-minute round-based multiplayer<br/></li><li> Dozens of simultaneous players<br/></li><li> Story elements will full voice acting<br/></li><li> Nine square miles of open world, spanning islands and cityscapes<br/></li><li> A colorful, retro aesthetic</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-20T03:44:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/748b240506dd61a9b161f5321d95c7fc.jpg", "website": "http://www.northofearth.com/omegalodon/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 115, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 355, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["North of Earth"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["North of Earth"], "esrb_rating": null}
