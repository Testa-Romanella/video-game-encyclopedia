This is currently in beta like the game itself as it is an early release. You basically have to launch birds in a slingshot at the green pigs and destroy all the pigs to win the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To open the level editor and make your own levels, press 'L' twice.</p>\n<p>A good computer CPU (Most healthy computers can play)\u00a0is recommened as loading levels takes a bit of power. It is also recommened to use the Chrome browser for best preformance. How fitting since this game is called Angry Birds Chrome.</p>\n<p>Report any bugs in the comments</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T05:24:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/923/9238a60bee85be9114c3062ff88ac490.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 3, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheRealXxxman360"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
