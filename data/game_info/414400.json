Simple, right?</p>\n<p>The catch is, there is a black hole that grows bigger for every shot you miss. If it gets too big, it consumes your whole screen and gives you a game over.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, there is also Portals you can go through, as well as jump pads you can use.</p>\n<p>One last thing, the hole at the end of the golf level is actually a wormhole that sends you to another dimension.
