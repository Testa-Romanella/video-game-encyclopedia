This is also my first game jam. I recently got motivated to learn some game development and have been loving every moment of it :3<br/><br/>This game was developed and programmed by myself. All art was made by my friend Jared. Music by Grant\u00a0soundcloud.com/48states (\"Spawn\" and \"Wilderness\"). Boss music made by Gage. The songs are old songs and more placeholders but they fit pretty well for now. <br/><br/>I plan to continue updating this game for a short period of time to add the complete functionality. The game has no win conditions currently and you cannot upgrade with gold/sell items but the boss is kill-able if you have not died to him. Once you die to the boss the game is unable to reset in the current state and must be restarted.<br/><br/>In future updates damage will be lowered and you must farm gold to increase damage to slowly work your way to the boss. The boss item will be heavy and dangerous to carry back.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T10:10:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/24314d21675b1e22031329752b7c8b17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["megumew"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
