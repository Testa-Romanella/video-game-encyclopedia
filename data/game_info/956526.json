Night Starcatcher can walk on black platforms and will fall through white platforms. The opposite is for Day Starchatcher. Use this to your advantage, change the character in the middle of a jump. You will die if you touch spikes or fall to the bottom. The respawn point is at the beginning of every level. There are 8 levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Tips.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Try to spam space while jumping. Most of the levels have two to three ways to complete a level, some paths are easier, some are harder.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Author.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This is the first time I used Scratch.
