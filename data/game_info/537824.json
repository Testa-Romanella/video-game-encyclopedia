You basically move a bunch of balls by pushing and flinging them through the playfield towards\u00a0a collector that sucks them in. The point is to keep the number of active balls in the field below a certain level. If you can do this before the timer runs out, you get to move on to the next level. At higher levels, the balls are spawned at a faster rate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/921f80c5734cc6de663e979ba164e5b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["roccode"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
