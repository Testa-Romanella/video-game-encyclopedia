There are a few hotspots of humans living amongst the ruins of civilization. Due to sparse resources, interactions between human <em>\u201ctribes\u201d</em> are mostly met with hostility and suspicion. It is common for search parties to raid hideouts and establishments for much needed supplies. \r\n  </p>\n<p>However, some hotspots are vastly more equipped and prepared to live in this new world. These people are considered less <em>\u201cferal\u201d</em> and more <em>\u201ccivilized\u201d</em> as they have managed to obtain and procure a steady flow of essentials items such as water, food and shelter. They are a very tightly knit community that will show no mercy to outsiders; especially those who raid <em>\u201ctheir\u201d </em>properties. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Fort Lytton is transformed into a garden that supplies food to this community. The topology of the area made it an ideal place to protect valuables. The surrounding forest trees, high density bushes and building ruins made it difficult for intruders to raid. It has been fortified further with fencing to surround the perimeter.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><strong>The VR Experience Premise</strong></strong>\n</p>\n<p>You <em>(the player)</em> have arrived at the entrance of Fort Lytton to begin your work shift and the makeshift radio tied to the bridge greets you. Unfortunately, the radio informs you that there was a raid on Fort Lytton a few days ago and had left the place in shambles. You are to clean up the various mess inside Fort Lytton and get it back to operation. The voice over the radio warns you of reporting anything suspicious.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em>This is a non-linear experience where the player is free to interact with the environment. The audio, various written items and environment setting will provide the player the story and give context to their actions.\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:22:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41b/41bcf7167be50b6648b20c543f045b8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["virtualenvironments"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
