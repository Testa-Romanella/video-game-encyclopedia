Face Yig in normal mode, Azathoth or Tsathoggua in hard mode, or Cthulhu or Ithaqua in very hard mode (in-app purchases required to face Cthulhu and Ithaqua).<br/>-A number of subtle changes increase the peril of defending humanity. For example, the random negative effects drawn every midnight are more challenging, and the frequency of \u201cno effect\u201d results has been decreased. Monsters have likewise been altered to make them more difficult. <br/>-Finally, there are no Ally cards in Elder Sign: Omens, which further streamlines play while increasing the overall challenge.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T09:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/277/2778f51c543fe9f4d001e5c9d4e1ef1d_tDLn3J5.jpg", "website": "http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=187&enmi=Elder%20Sign:%20Omens", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fantasy Flight Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Fantasy Flight Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
