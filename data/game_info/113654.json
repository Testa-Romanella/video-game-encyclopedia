The game features Catbox, who is a square cat, and tasks players with taking care of him. Catbox can have a range of complex personalities, and his actions change over time depending on his personality, his mood, and his interactions with the player.<br/></p><p>The current build of <em>Catbox</em> is a proof-of-concept prototype, and as such is missing some features and a level of polish that I would like to include in a potential future 'finished' version. </p><p>The software is designed for mobile deployment, so the desktop implementation here is a temporary solution designed for testing. Most of the game can be played with the mouse as if it were a touchscreen input, with the Z and X keys used to zoom in and out in place of pinch gestures. </p><p>In any case, I hope you enjoy playing with Catbox, and make sure to take good care of him!</p><p>If you are interested in reading about the research and development of <em>Catbox</em>, you can check out the following links:</p><ul><li>Project overview</li><li>Development diaries</li><li>Case study research</li></ul><p><em>Design and development by Tom Battey.</em></p><p><em>Music and sound design by </em><em>Edward A.
