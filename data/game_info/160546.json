It is very simple, but I think the idea is compelling and properly executed. The most important thing that would need to be improved in a future version would be increasing the size of the world. Beyond that, procedurally generating a world, incorporating sound, and tightening up some of the code could add a lot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/153/1537cac49f715d76e2673fe47d2df575.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoshMelnick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
