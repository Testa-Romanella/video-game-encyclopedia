I've decided that now would be a perfect time to put it out as an early access product for all of you to enjoy. Please, do keep in mind that new content and features will be constantly added in futures upgrades. Each sold copy of the game would support the continuous development.</p>\r\nWhat is it about?\r\n<p>The Hollow Kings is a desktop multiplayer tower assault game heavily inspired by Clash Royale. Level up, collect cards, evolve troops, build decks, and duel other players around the world!</p>\n<p>\r\nCurrently, there are two game modes available:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Training - fight with a bot which adapts to your skills;</li><li>Matchmaking - you will be paired with another player depending on your diamond count and tower level;</li></ul>\n<p>Features of the current version:</p>\n<ul><li>19 unlockable and upgradable cards -<strong> troops, spells, and buildings</strong>. Each has its own unique features and capabilities that you have to consider coming up with battle strategies.</li><li>Two reward chest types - <strong>wooden</strong> and <strong>stone</strong>. If you do win the battle you might be able to receive one or another. Many more chests coming out in future upgrades.</li><li>The first combat arena - Forest. I've already been actively working to add many more. They can be unlocked depending on your diamond count.</li></ul>\n<p>If you have arena, card ideas or changes you would like to see in overall design of the game, please send them to me! For example, \"What do you think if before each round players could manually position their towers?\", or \"Maybe we could get rid of these three towers and just replace them with a castle surrounded by walls made of stone\u00a0for enemy troops to break in and destroy the king?\"\u00a0 I\u00a0hope you get the idea.</p>\n<p>Bugs and any other comments are very appreciated as well!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:53:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/750/75020d100bbeffd2d4bf4386793b126a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Normunds Petrovs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
