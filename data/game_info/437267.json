In this game you play as slimy the slime (very creative) as he jumps up and up a mountain to try to get to his home! (Little does he know this is an endless game). You need to successfully aim and jump onto platforms on the side of the mountain and go up as high as you can. But be careful, if you fall off the screen, you lose! (You don't want that to happen do you?) Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong><strong><em>Aim with Mouse and Click</em></strong> - To shoot the slime into a certain direction. Hold the\u00a0 mouse down to get more force and aim further from the slime to get even more force! Be careful to manage these two elements and not over/undershoot!</p>\n<p><strong><em>(Windows Version Only) Q </em></strong>- Quit the game<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\r\nProgramming/ArtFlamingSparrowMusicBarkenergiaAlso Helped With Music synth pad, piano and with Game Over SFX<br/>Eduardo Morais<br/>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:08:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61a/61aac296b786df7a2b69fa8d098fa6b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["FlamingSparrow"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
