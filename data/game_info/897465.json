But its not just them they have backup from several prominent sl4tes members. Fight in 2 iconic locations with the power of your cookies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD-Directional movement, \"S\" is crouch.</p>\n<p>Space-Jump</p>\n<p>Exclusive movement:</p>\n<p>Ctrl-Descend</p>\n<p>Shift-Sprint</p>\n<p>Cookie Jump- Time jumps where the revolving cookies are beneath you to double jump!</p>\n<p>NOTE: I forgot to add a couple off people to the thank you list at the end. So thank you HmmNoPls, Cakequake, zihao9509, Johie, ISOPROYT, A Cat Galaxy, NotShush, Darkgamer, Terms, Fantam. Thanks everyone.</p>\n\n<p>COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS:</p>\n<p>Why is the Jake fight on a loop? Its not you have to collect the cookies by touching them with your player and then you should click Mouse1 or left click to release the cookies and if you damage the boss enough you can proceed to the next phase.</p>\n<p>Why is the Quick Time Event broken? So in the quick time event you have to click all the buttons shown on screen and you dont have to be holding \"D\" as time is slowed down however it is recommended to. Also\u00a0dont tap \"D\" again as that will register as a key press messing up the quick time event.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T11:34:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/627/627949df61c1d4ab61578e0ff5ba0e15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["RDevelopments"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
