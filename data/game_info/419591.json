I'm releasing it in this early state because I plan on pausing development of it until after I take my end-of-highschool exams, however, I do have a history of setting my games on permanent \"hiatus\" and I was really pleased with the progress I've made while working on this game, so I wanted to at least have a playable version of it somewhere on the interwebs.</p>\n<p>The goal was to create a calm, contemplative experience for the player to zone out in while exploring the river and\u00a0learning to row the kayak. I don't think it manages to achieve that experience, at least not to the level that I would've liked, but I still think it's rather neat, especially considering how far out of my <em>\"area of \"expertise\"\"</em> it was.</p>\n<p>This was my first go at making a 3D game, so I kept the gameplay fairly basic and I focused on making it look as nice as I could,\u00a0and on learning the specifics of 3D development, like basic modeling, some lighting and\u00a0playing with the water assets. The environments were made with\u00a0a simple mesh generation script that took real world heightmaps (using\u00a0https://tangrams.github.io/heightmapper) and\u00a0converted them to a low-poly mesh, after which I heavily modified them to add interesting-looking cliff faces, overhangs and such.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any feedback,\u00a0especially about how I could achieve that contemplative sort of experience, do please send me a message; I'd love to hear it! :)</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<strong>Music &amp; Sounds Used:</strong></p>\n<p>- White Lotus  -  By Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.filmmusic.io)</p>\n<p>- Infardos - By Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.filmmusic.io)</p>\n<p>- Touching Moments Four - By Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.filmmusic.io)</p>\n<p>- Birds Chirping - By Zapsplat (zapsplat.com)</p>\n<p>- Water Splash - By FreeSFX\u00a0(freesfx.co.uk)</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022\u00a0Other Assets Used:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- WorldSkies Pro (Skyboxes) - By Pulsar Bytes\u00a0</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Aura 2 (Volumetric Fog) - By Raphael Ernaelsten</p>\n<p>- Aquas 2020 (Water) - By Dogmatic Games</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u2022 Play the First</strong><strong> Prototype</strong>\u00a0Here!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:04:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5b/f5beb3e6908c73cd0b6889cddc178670.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Moon Light Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
