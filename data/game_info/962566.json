When the enemy's generals are fatigued and incompetent, try to set traps to lower their morale, reduce their attack power, and halve their damage,<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt this point, we worked hard to win.

When the enemy does not resist during the attack, our side gradually erodes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n1. It is necessary to select suitable targets based on the \"strength value\" of each alliance, and special skills are required for targets with equivalent \"strength value\", otherwise the attack may fail.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n2. Special skills need to be used according to the \"harmonious\", \"resources\", and \"intelligence\" of each alliance. When the \"harmonious\" is less than 100, the \"trap\" skill can be used,<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen the \"resources\" is less than 100, the \"support\" skill can be used, and when the \"intelligence\" is less than 100, the \"bribery\" skill can be used.
