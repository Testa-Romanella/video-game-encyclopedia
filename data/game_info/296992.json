I also had midterms this week so I ran out of time. But I wanted to submit something. I worked really hard on it for about a day! making a ton of progress. Then didn't touch it for a week. 12\u00a0hours before the deadline I\u00a0figured I\u00a0might as well scramble and get something submitted. So I threw out a bunch of features and Ideas I had (Sadly)\u00a0I added in a way to win and lose. That is what you are playing! I\u00a0hope you enjoy.\u00a0 Other Notes:</p>\n<p>The Controller took me the most amount of time. Because we couldn't use the standard assets I\u00a0had to come up with my own version. I think I\u00a0did a good job, but under the hood it's not nearly as simple as I\u00a0would like. The camera moves separately from the parent player and there are no looking/camera constraints. But I\u00a0ran out of time to fix that.</p>\n<p>Picking up was fun to make. It's a simple script that I\u00a0wrote. A simple raycast comes out of the camera and if it sees an object tagged for picking up and the user clicks the mouse the objects then has a moveTowards added to it that moves it to a child empty point in space in front of the camera.</p>\n<p>\u00a0What I\u00a0am most sad about is the fact that I\u00a0didn't have time to compose a song about the friendzone for nice background music.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hope you Enjoy playing and can't wait for the next one!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:02:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b3/4b37fa92d54a9d1eb3657a5bac661766.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["austinGENEreeve"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
