This game has only been released for testing purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Press play on the title screen, then use the arrow keys to chose a game mode. Select it with space. We recommend playing in creative first, just to get the feel of how the game works.</p>\n<p>Mouse over the build tab to open it and scroll through it with left and right. Select a tile simply by clicking it. In most game modes, a certain amount of money and/or\u00a0research points will be needed to place a tile. You can't place a tile if you don't have enough money / research, or your world doesn't have the tile it needs to be placed on.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you figure it out as you go. Remember, this game is in early access. We will be adding a tutorial feature soon.</p>\n\n<p>Music:\u00a0Kevin MacLeod - Floating Cities</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T10:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/759db5b9a7675051eb2563dbc7838c4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spruce Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
