It is a\u00a0short rpg story about a kid named Red who goes on an adventure to save a town, defeat some goo-blins, bring balance to the elemental forces in the world, make some friends along the way, get lost in a misty forest, make a few somewhat dated and\u00a0obscure\u00a0references,\u00a0possibly\u00a0retrieve a legendary sword, and maybe stop the spread of an encroaching evil force of darkness before it is too late. This game has everything crammed into it that I could fit in, except maybe an original plot.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:22:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01b/01bb55d7f5cadf006064294e8f16cf1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DungeonsandDadJokes"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
