If your monitor is 16:10 the edges of some levels may be cut off.\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary:\u00a0</strong>This is a platformer but the only way to control your character is by placing portals. The character walks forward automatically. Only one complete portal can be placed at a time, that means one opening end of the portal and one closing end as well. If another portal is placed, the previous portal will disappear.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Move mouse to position portals, left click or space bar to place portal.<br/></p>\n<p>If a glitch is encountered use the restart button on the upper right corner to reset the level.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s recommended that you play the levels in order. This way the mechanics are introduced slowly. If there is a level you just can\u2019t get past, you can go to the menu and skip to the \u00a0next level.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Video:</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T11:36:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ea/9ea5231aa69fb857f6bb2ed996884710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["skiwee45", "blueputty01"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
