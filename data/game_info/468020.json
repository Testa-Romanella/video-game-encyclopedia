My Contribution to GMTK2020.</p>\n<p>This is the first thing I\u2019ve ever developed and finished solo. So, sorry that it\u2019s a bit simple and a bit buggy.</p>\n<p>Premise:\u00a0</p>\n<p>To go along with the theme of \u201cOut of Control\u201d I\u2019ve decided to make an Auto Battler in the vain of Stick War or Civilizations Wars style \u201cstrategy\u201d games. In those style games, you can\u2019t control your units directly, only spawn them. I\u2019ve decided to make it even more idle.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>The units are random. The time they spawn is random. And the only direct control you have is a button you can use to get them to move forward. This button also buffs them with a random stat, which is not known to you. So, you can choose to spam the charge button for a strong frontline of units, or build up units for a massive wave. Once you run out of Units and your field is clear, the game is over. Kill as many spiders as you can.</p>\n<p>Credit:</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Aggressive Bit by J-DiewYX</p>\n<p>https://j-dieswyx.newgrounds.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:31:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd1f40e31e912bb975d38dcbe8584c17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KindSpark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
