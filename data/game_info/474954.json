This mountain goes all the way to the other end of the Universe, and very few have made it to the top. Sisyphus has conquered Hades, but he is still not satisfied! He is now throwing all his boulders down the hill, trying to kill anyone he sees on the hill! You have also been given the same punishment as Sisyphus, but Hades is gone, so your punishment is over! All of Hell is being destroyed, and the mountain is beginning to sink in lava. You must outrun the lava while avoiding Sisyphus\u2019 boulders! Make it to the end of the universe before it\u2019s too late!</p>\n<p>Simpler description: Hold the w key and run up the infinite mountain while dodging the lava boulders and without getting too close to the lava that's rising. Also make sure to use the super speed power up!</p>\n<p>The better description, background music, UI elements and most sound effects were made by\u00a0Chris.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The simpler description, programming, 3d modeling, environment designing\u00a0and sound optimization\u00a0were made by An3.</p>\n<p>**** Download the Windows desktop build for smoother and better graphics and sound quality! It's only 636 kb!</p>\n<p>*In the game, I used original assets that my friend and I created during the gamejam. The only premade asset I used was a movement script that I had developed before the jam, but I still heavily modified it to suit this game.\u00a0 Everything else was 3d modeled, coded, designed and recorded during the game jam! This was my first game jam and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait for the next Score Space Jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/528/52814a78c017bcf549c0b54ead0d66e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["An3Ned"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
