If you really want to play with a lower resolution, just play in window mode.</li>\n<li>Try to play with at least 30 - 40 FPS otherwise it's to hard to navigate (activate a debug FPS display with F6)</li>\n</ul><ul>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>OSX</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>On some MacBooks, on of the post effect shaders won't work on the first start. Just got to the settings menu and switch a bit between the VFX settings or switch from fullscreen to window mode and back. This should solve that problem.</li>\n<li>A known issue with the Mac version, is an error displaying that the app \r\nis damaged and can't be opened and be moved to the trash. To fix this, \r\njust go to System Preferences and Security &amp; Privacy and under Allow\r\n applications downloaded from, select Anywhere.\r\n\t<br/>\n</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Linux ( experimental )</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Try starting the game on good or lower quality settings on any display issues.</li>\n<li>If the game window crash after start, try starting the game with -force-opengl\r\n\t./berlin82.x86_64 -force-opengl\r\n\t</li>\n</ul><ul>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tI started the development on that game to test some solutions in Unity3D. After a while it was like a bit of fun trying to cruise around in the city. So I put more like a game around the prototype.
