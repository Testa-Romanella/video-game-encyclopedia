The grid size is slightly smaller due to reduced memory on the unexpanded VIC. This will run nicely on the VICE Emulator running in VIC unexpanded mode. Cursor keys move the flashing cursor and space bar will examine a spot for mines. If a mine is present, you lose, otherwise a number will replace the circle to indicate the number of adjacent spots with a mine. F key will flag a spot as a potential mine without examining it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>1 PRINT\"SQSTBY...\":DIMM(14,14):DIMN(14,14):C=144:G=7771:FORX=1TO14:FORZY=1TO14</p>\n<p>K is the size of the minefield.
