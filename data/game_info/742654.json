{"id": 742654, "slug": "star-mountain", "name": "Star Mountain", "name_original": "Star Mountain", "description": "<p>Star Mountain is a co-op game, where you and an opponent fight to get to a star first. In order to do so, you must duplicate yourself and use that past body to stack to the star.</p>\n\r\nTips:\r\n<ul><li>Sliding is the way to go. Try to angle yourself diagonally and then duplicate so you can launch yourself off of it and gain more momentum\r\n</li><li>Don't just rush for the star, try and pay attention to your opponent and what they're doing. You can always try to block their path, or use their duplicated selves to aid yourself.\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nBombs:\r\n<p>Bombs are good. If you touch the bomb, it will destroy every duplicate of the opponent, and respawn them. Although sometimes, say if you're stuck, it can helpful to have the opponent get the bomb.\r\n</p>\n\r\nHow it was made\r\n<p>Star mountain was the first game I made, and worked on for a few months in Unity. My main purpose in making it was less for the game development, and more for working with the visual programming language, Max. Using MaxMSP I made all the sounds and music for the game, which respond and adapt based on the gameplay. At first, I communicated between Max and Unity using OSC, but later wanted to package the audio with the game, so I switched to using Pure Data instead of Max. I integrated my Pure Data patches using LibPD after recreating all my Max patches in PD.\r\n</p>\n\r\nMultiplayer\r\n<p>Something that was a goal of mine with this project was to try and implement some level of multiplayer. While I did accomplish this using Photon, it is very rough at the moment. Local multiplayer runs relatively well, but there are still plenty of bugs. I kept multiplayer in the current version just to demonstrate where I got to, not neccassarily because it fully works.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T08:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/913/9138eba4218543a8b3af27d37d404308.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Sam Knight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
