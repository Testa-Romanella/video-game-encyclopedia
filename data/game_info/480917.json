Use the powers of chance, and some magic-manipulation spells, to summon magical energies to defeat your enemies in single-round combat. Explore a BIG tiny world to solve the mystery of the run-down fountain.<br/></p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to move and mouse to select things. Check out the manual for details on the game's icons and windows.<br/></p>\n<p>The combat system is inspired by\u00a0One Deck Dungeon by Chris Cieslik, published by Asmadi Games. One of my favorite tabletop game systems, I thought it would be appropriate for a text-light 64 x 64 pixel game. I make no claim to inventing it, and hope that Mr. Cieslik appreciates my attempt to homage his excellent game system.</p>\n<p>I'll be continuing to make minor improvements and to fix things that people suggest or find fault with, so please comment and let me know what you think!<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Ian D'Aprix: Programming, art, design</p>\n<p>Brandon Edwards: Art</p>\n<p>Edward Beltran: Music and sound</p>\n<p>One Deck Dungeon is copyright Asmadi Games 2017.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a87c49412aa0da48afb0f44445cf480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iandaprix"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
