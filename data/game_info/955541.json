It's expected to be there, but it's not important.\u201d<br/><br/>John Carmack<br/><br/>ILLWILL has no plot in the usual sense. However, each location in the game has its own atmosphere and conveys the story through the environment. The game begins in a closed room, according to the state of which it can be understood that the main hero spent a lot of time inside of it. There are many details in ILLWILL that refer to emotions such as sadness or feelings of loneliness. The game has strong contrasts from gloomy corridors full of hopelessness to large and bright levels inspired by art of Salvador Dali. We can say that ILLWILL is the life experience of the author, both visually imaginative and gameplay experience, down to specific emotions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-14T22:14:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/154/154976eb9876bf91a88f5f0fe98a8919.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 552, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slava Bushuev"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Slava Bushuev"], "esrb_rating": null}
