The palette breathes vapor-wave landscapes to me, thus inspiring this landscape runner game.</p>\n<p>Pilot your motorcycle with deft precision, dodging between cars and trucks\u00a0while enjoying sick electronic rhythms and retro inspired visuals. <em>Orrr</em> just sit back and watch the sunset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Objectives:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Get the highest score you can! The faster you drive the faster you gain score, but the harder it is to maneuver and dodge traffic.\u00a0<em>Note: If you're moving too slow you might not gain any score and can even lose some!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keyboard: Arrow keys (or WASD), left/right to move your motorcycle, down to hit the brakes, up to accelerate, R to restart and Esc to return to menu if you crash</p>\n<p>Gamepad: Left analog for moving, right directional pad for braking/accelerating, Start to restart and Select to return to menu.</p>\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Extras/Quirks that may or may not be obvious:\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<ul><li><em>Y<em>es there is a night mode, but\u00a0can you last long enough to reach it ;)</em></em></li><li><em>The scoring system is built to handle near infinite scores. Just how far can you get?</em></li><li><em>The cars and trucks produce wind currents that can push you around if you get too close.</em></li><li><em>Be careful about getting too close to the side of the road, the gravel shoulder on this road has been known to pop tires ;)</em></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>All Music:\u00a0\u00a92019 Joshua McLean \t\t(mrjoshuamclean.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International</p>\n<p>Vehicle Sprites/Animations:\u00a0Mads J.
