The game is forty years old.\u00a0And we love Asteroids! But we can make it better. Stronger. Faster. Harder. Newer!</p>\n<p>Gravitroids is much like Asteroids, but you have a gravity well to worry about in the middle of the field. This well, a star, will attract the asteroids, your ship, and your bullets to it! Each round contains three 'roids to destroy.</p>\n<p>This game is in development. In the future, the between-missions store should have unique upgrades available. There will be more types of debris, likely a separate currency from your score, new weapons, and enemies. Likely we'll also have new suns. At this point, though, I am willing to say that the game isn't just playable, it's actually a lot of fun; so time to put it up!</p>\n<p>I'm learning Godot alongside Unity, because I feel every developer should. So, it seemed wise to try my hand at a few simple projects before I dive into anything huge.\u00a0(The engine is actually quite effective for 2D stuff.) So far I'm liking it and working fast, so these updates shouldn't be long coming.</p>\n<p>Those who want to keep an eye on future projects should follow me on my Patreon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T04:02:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fd/8fd58631551192579f81fa0b45e820ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vikinghelmet99"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
