We set out to create an isometric shooter with a story about a boy who lost his Teddy Bear. What we ended up with was a deep narrative where the player is playing Timmy as if they were young and imagining themselves being read the story about the real Timmy from their parents.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programmer, Producer, Writer, UI Animations : Jonathan Carlson<br/>UI Art Assets, 3d Characters, Rigging, Animation, Art Director: Makayla Hicks<br/>Level Design, and Level Concepts : Thomas Parker<br/>3D Environmental Assets and Textures: Sydney Willis<br/>3D Enviormental Assets and Textures: Brittany Whelihan<br/>Voice Acting: James Belair<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b27c3433f55dd4472bf7463effe515e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrittWhelihan", "JonathanCarlson", "SydJaye"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
