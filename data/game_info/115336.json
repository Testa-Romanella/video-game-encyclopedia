Please support the games you like so that you can see more of them.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Ghost is the ship waiting at the bottom of the screen, and he has neat abilities. He can warp around the screen (Asteroids-style), deflect purple blasts, and after deflecting enough small purple shots he begins to glow. This means he'll release a blast in 3 seconds, doing damage to anything in its range and destroying small purple shots for points! Use him for 2-player or multitask by yourself. Move him slightly off-screen if you're done with him!<br/>Stop the Drill King from drilling space for its resources at the expense of everyone else! Take an experimental new weapon and bring its power to bear against your enemies. Think this is your usual shmup? Think again. Be careful with your shots, and aim true. <br/>Donations allow me to keep making free games for you all, so please donate at this page by supporting any of my games listed.<br/>https://donstathemonsta.itch.io/</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Destroy the enemy, and try not to destroy yourself.
