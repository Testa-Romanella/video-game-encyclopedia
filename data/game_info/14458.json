But the only royal available is a girl affectionately nicknamed Princess Ooh-Look-a-Kitty, for...fairly obvious reasons. Teamed with a flustered bodyguard, a dismissive soldier of fortune, and a lovestruck nomad, Princess Calliope has to navigate a world she barely understands to save the world. <br/>And if she's not careful, she might just grow up a little.
