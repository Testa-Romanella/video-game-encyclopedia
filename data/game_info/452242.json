Plagued constantly by monsters, can you survive?</p>\n<p>The game revolves around different elements and their strengths and weaknesses. Your equipment reflects this. Wearing the right equipment at the right time can be the difference between survival and your untimely demise.</p>\n<p>This was a game I made for a game jam competition I entered years ago. The game will be about half an hour long and, according to limited feedback, might be a bit difficult. So if you like a challenge, I hope you will enjoy this RPG! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:34:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/935/9359b9f384b989f1666f07a3606b444b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KaaaaasKop"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
