Like what would happen to Excalibur if King Arthur never got to extract it from the rock?\".</p>\n<p>The gameplay is a Fantasy themed 2D action/adventure game in which the protagonist,\u00a0Dirge, a sword which can absorb mana spirits in order to switch what type of weapon he is, travels around the world after being once again disappointed by a self proclaimed \"Hero worthy of the legendary sword\", in search of a true weapon master capable of handling his power.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is heavily inspired by the original \"The Legend of Zelda\", \"Sword of Ditto\", \"The Binding of Isaac\" and other games from which we freely took inspiration both for the graphical aspect and the gameplay loop.</p>\n<p>It was our first time working together as a team and making a game as complex as this one, but we are happy with what came out as it was everyone's first game jam scenario.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:49:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2db7e691eeff78c40a274937d1319134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RitoDeleteIvern"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
