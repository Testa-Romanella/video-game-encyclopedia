The player&#39;s car can shot bullets in several directions as well as grenades. It&#39;s fast and challenging, definitely recommended, specially for fans of Road Fighter or F1 Spirit. It has some funny engrish text like &quot;Daras&quot; instead of Dallas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-13T01:36:23", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": [], "developers": [], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
