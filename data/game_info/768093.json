It is a mini casual game to relax to, but also excel at, by trying to achieve the highest score.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach level represents a flag, while the cars hold a minimalistic style. The sounds follow the same pattern by being abstract in their manner.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 Mechanics: As simple as possible, the players just have to press on the traffic lights to change from red to green and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 Relaxing: The game is as stressful as you want it to be, with the time also available on fast and slow. Fast however provides you with double score.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 Competitive: For the hard working people out there, there is a scoring system for each level, at which everyone can excel at.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 Interesting decisions: Every level provides a different traffic management, making the players adapt to every situation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 Abilites: Every in-game day the players get an ability to help with their progression.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHope you get as many cars as you can across traffic!
