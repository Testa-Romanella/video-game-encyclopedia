If it doesn't, pick it up with your mouse and drop it in the orange trash bin above.\u00a0 Otherwise, let it fall into the blue bin at the end of the belt.\u00a0To speed up production, click on the red button on the wall. Putting a robot in the correct bin earns 1 \"productivity point\" while putting it in the wrong bin, makes you lose 3. You have 90 seconds to earn as many productivity points as you can. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T06:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d4/9d45e27b444136525aaadf5583a3d9a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Magnarris"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
