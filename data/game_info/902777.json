You can control the player (the red smiley face) via\u00a0the right, left, and down arrow keys. Don't reach the bottom of the screen and don't hit the blue bar. Each time the blue bar crosses the screen, you get some more flapping power and a point. Hitting the green dot increases your flapping power by 1. Finally, you win the game if you get a score of 5.\u00a0This game is still in development - expect music, effects, and more to be there in the future!</p>\n<p>This is my first game on itch.io and my first PICO-8 game. Don't expect great quality, but do expect better games in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T12:49:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d2/2d25a8d87b4f5c8726e7a90aededeacb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["revquant"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
