The simulation utilises real-time physics to address gameplay mechanics.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p> The basis of the game follows the conventions of classical 8 ball pool, which is turn-orientated and conditioned by a series of rules. Two players alternate their turn locally via one device. Each player's objective is to defeat one another, corresponding with the rules of the sport.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:07:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab69a9152c67957c7e36759fce88cc6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Hubble"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
