We planned to have more islands, but we found that island property costs more than our allowance. We will likely update this with more fun stuff. </p>\n<p>The game is multiplayer so you might want to find a buddy to play with if there's noone on. Server is based in EU, and we aren't professional network engineers so don't mind a bit (a lot) of lag occasionally ;P<br/></p>\n<p>Source available here: https://github.com/antloop-studios/fowl-play<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Esc - exit the game<br/>W,A,S,D - movement<br/>Mouse - aim your attack<br/>Mouse Left Click - punch with all your might</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Find the opposing chicken and steal its eggs to make a delicious omelette.
