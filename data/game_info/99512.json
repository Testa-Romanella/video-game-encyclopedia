Maybe you should see what you can do.This place seems fairly safe. You still have not figured out how you got here, but it appears you have a simple goal - collect those planks and build your way to that top of that structure.You hope you will find a way out of here, as it seems quite lackluster and you are getting bored. You have found nothing very interesting, but you continue on your way to completing your apparent task in hopes of finding something more exciting to do.Wanderer is a short ambient adventure game with a few simple puzzles. It is somewhat analogous to life through text that appears throughout the game.If you&#39;re interested in further updates and more games in the future, visit my Twitter page!<br />\nBug Fix!
