Lure enemies to your towers while avoiding crashing into rocks, enemies, and your own trail! Spend gems that you earn to upgrade your fire, stun, archer, and cannon towers until your archer lives in a wooden castle tower, your cannon is made of pure gold, or your fire tower is flowing with lava. You can also spend your gems to unlock new cars with special abilities! Tip: The following cars have special abilities that are not shown in their stats: peacock car, cat car,\u00a0 monster truck, muenster truck, and gold car (I think that's it, I might have forgotten one.)</p>\n<p>POST-MORTEM 1 CHANGES: <br/></p>\n<p>-Best wave was wrong, fixed this</p>\n<p>-Best wave was not saved, fixed this</p>\n<p>-You couldn't crash into edge of world, fixed this</p>\n<p>-Improved text readability</p><p>POST-MORTEM 2 CHANGES:</p><p>-Added easy/normal difficulty modes<br/></p><p>-When the game starts, the archer tower is now selected by default</p><p>-Tower level wasn't saved properly (Style / texture and cost were not saved), fixed this</p><p>-Cars are now rendered slightly larger so that they fit their collision boxes properly</p><p>-In the main menu, you can now click on a car to select it (As well as using the purple arrow buttons like before)</p><p>-Bugged a few other squashes. -I mean squashed a few other bugs.
