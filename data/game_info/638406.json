This game features:</p>\n<p>Unique game mechanics: Try destroying all the enemy pellets the fishing boats throw at you by extending your arms outward and causing the pellets to be destroyed in return!</p>\n<p>Varying difficulty: As you level up, the game will become more and more difficult. See if you have the skills to be able to exceed the maximum difficulty level of 128 and go as long as you can!</p>\n<p>Nostalgia factor: Everyone loves games with a retro aesthetic, and that's exactly what this game contains! Every byte of this game both looks and sounds just like a game that could be from the 80s (a long time ago).</p>\n<p><strong>PC Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>1, 2, 3, and\u00a04 Keys - Extend arms</li><li>Horizontal Arrows or \"AD\" Keys - Moving head</li><li>Enter Key - Shoot pellet &amp; game starting</li><li>Escape Key - Quit the game</li></ul>\n<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy my game, as it's the first of many more.
