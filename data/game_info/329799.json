Lead developer here. I just want you to know that this is in a VERY incomplete state. Yes, I know this is gonna lose a lot of points for the jam, but please, I'm begging you as if I'm an attention whore, look at this again when I upload the complete version. The team worked very hard on this and I was only able to use around 1/3 of the team's assets. I don't care that it doesn't count for points in the jam. I just want my team members to feel appreciated for their work. I understand that not utilizing everyone's work shows incompetence as a lead developer, but I WILL finish this to make up for it. Just please, give us a chance to let my team members shine. If you do look at it again soon, please do not rate the game based on the updates, as it is unfair. I love my team members very much, as they have been with me for a long time now. I am very sorry.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f2/8f20a564d4176df2fcaadcd34f202721.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChairGTables"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
