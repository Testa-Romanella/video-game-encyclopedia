Change levels to be built around spawning waves of enemies versus a set amount of enemies at the start. Change game to have \"XP\" instead of score, and at a certain XP you would get an upgrade, whether it's faster bullets, more speed, more health, or something of the sort. Secondary change- make the levels look better than they do now.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T11:41:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/796/796dd3e5eff1ee1cabab118f1f58ba6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SaltyLily"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
