Do you have any such experience?<br/><br/>Many VRSNS and online games are designed on the assumption that you have friends. Rooms that only allow friends. Content that requires multiple players. Bonuses for inviting friends.<br/><br/>Unmetaverse is a VRSNS for people who don't have any friends.<h3>No voice chat</h3>.<br/>We've eliminated the biggest barrier for shady people: voice chat. No more checking your microphone every minute to make sure it's not unmuted.<br/><br/>In Unmetaverse, everyone is mute. There is not even text chat. Gestures are the only means of communication.<h3>Open World</h3>.<br/>The Unmetaverse world is a huge 10km x 10km open world. Everyone shares the same world.<br/><br/>Unmetaverse is large enough for you to get away from the hustle and bustle and spend some time by yourself.<h3>No need to create</h3>.<br/>Unmetaverse is not a service for creators. Everything you need to enjoy the world is already provided for you.<br/><br/>Build houses, gather nuts, cultivate land, and develop your village. You don't have to be a creator or an influencer in this world. Everyone is equally a pioneer here. You are the star of this world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T04:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b442ce7ec128274bca918b8efe8b0c59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mito Memel"], "genres": ["Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mito Memel"], "esrb_rating": null}
