Travel through the human lands, pillaging villages, recruiting and subduing other tribes to pit against the organized, efficient human armies.

Set examples and chop the weakest, feed their remains to the most powerful ones and gain their loyalty.<br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Tabletop Experience</strong>: move your tribe in turns and end the game before the month runs out, or gain precious time by interfering with the human plans.<br/></li><li> <strong>Tactical Combat</strong>: encounter unique human armies in every mission. Find a way to outsmart and outmaneuver the overpowering human troops.<br/></li><li> <strong>16 goblin classes</strong>, each with unique abilities, ranging from the fat, angry berserkers to the frail and certainly not mad scientists.<br/></li><li> <strong>Recruit and field new goblins</strong> to level them up and gain more abilities.
