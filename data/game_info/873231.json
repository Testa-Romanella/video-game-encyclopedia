Parasites are humanoid, planet-hopping alien beings that are able to take on a new\u00a0human\u00a0<strong>form</strong>\u00a0based on their hosts\u00a0<strong>Complex, Emotions</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Desires</strong>,\u00a0often using an attractive appearance to\u00a0<strong>persuade</strong>\u00a0and<strong>\u00a0influence</strong>\u00a0their hosts for a mutual gain between the two life forms.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, there is another set of beings known by the Parasites and\u00a0<strong>Epoch Agency</strong>\u00a0known as \u201c<strong>Reapers</strong>\u201d. These Reapers, much like their Parasite counterparts, look\u00a0<strong>remarkably</strong>\u00a0human and almost\u00a0<strong>angelic</strong>\u00a0yet they possess\u00a0<strong>extraordinary abilities</strong>\u00a0much like their Parasite counterparts. A Reaper\u2019s goal seems to be solely to\u00a0<strong>eradicate</strong>\u00a0the Parasites while the Parasites<strong>\u00a0resist</strong>\u00a0and find suitable hosts in order to utilize their own\u00a0<strong>parasitic abilities</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once the Parasite(s) arrive,\u00a0<strong>strange events</strong>\u00a0begin to happen within the town. Ranging from a\u00a0<strong>robot</strong>\u00a0attacking you through your TV screen to a\u00a0<strong>giant hand</strong>\u00a0falling onto your town from outer space.\u00a0<strong>No one knows</strong>\u00a0what causes these events but you have a feeling it has something to do with the Parasites and Reapers\u00a0<strong>presence</strong>\u00a0in your world.\r\n</p>\n<p>In a way, Parasites represent the\u00a0<strong>Characters maturity</strong>\u00a0or desire for maturity while Reapers and other elements may represent the things these Characters\u00a0<strong>suppress</strong>\u00a0within themselves.\u00a0<strong>EMPTY CYCLE</strong>\u00a0is a short but deep seated game that aims to incorporate\u00a0<strong>symbolism</strong>\u00a0in every turn and action.\r\n</p>\r\n\"<em>FLCL-inspired tabletop RPG Empty Cycle is all small towns, big robots and bigger\u00a0angst</em>\" - Dicebreaker\r\n<p>Features of the<strong>\u00a0full version</strong>\u00a0of\u00a0<strong>EMPTY CYCLE</strong>\u00a0include:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Table of Contents\r\n</li><li>Introduction to the Game\r\n</li><li>Character Creation Rules\r\n</li><li>Parasite Creation Rules\r\n</li><li>Rules on how to Play the Game\r\n</li><li>Enemy Creation Rules\r\n</li><li>Designer Notes</li></ul>\r\nBuy the physical book of EMPTY CYCLE here!\r\n\r\n\r\nGet EMPTY CYCLE merch here!FOLLOW ALONG WITH US:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Reddit</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Discord</strong>\n</li></ul>\r\nLISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF EMPTY CYCLE", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T06:21:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4fff0d8d2744c25d60af1df35671bc55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rookie Jet Studio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
