For tens of millions of years, starting from the Mesozoic era, the structure of sea turtles remained practically unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>The earless seals (family Phocidae)</strong>, phocids or true seals are one of the three main groups of mammals within the seal lineage, Pinnipedia. Some subspecies are endangered.</p>\n<p><strong>Pelagic fish</strong> live in the pelagic zone of ocean or lake waters \u2013 being neither close to the bottom nor near the shore \u2013 in contrast with demersal fish that do live on or near the bottom, and reef fish that are associated with coral reefs.</p>\n<p><strong>The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias)</strong> is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans.</p>\n<p><strong>Jellyfish and sea jellies</strong> are the informal common names given to the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa. Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being mobile.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus)</strong> is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whale suborder Mysticeti. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 meters (98 feet), it is the largest animal known to have ever existed.</p>\n<p><strong>Laminaria</strong> is a genus of 31 species of brown algae commonly called \"kelp\". It is found in the north Atlantic Ocean and the northern Pacific Ocean. Laminaria form a habitat for many fish and invertebrates.</p>\n<p><strong>A seahorse</strong> (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is any of 46 species of small marine fish in the genus Hippocampus. \"Hippocampus\" comes from the Ancient Greek hippokampos (\u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 hipp\u00f3kampos), meaning \"sea monster\".</p>\n<p><strong>The Molidae</strong> comprise the family of the molas or ocean sunfishes, unusual fish whose bodies come to an end just behind the dorsal and anal fins, giving them a \"half-fish\" appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>A snail</strong> is, in loose terms, a shelled gastropod. The common name snail is also used for most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into.</p>\n<p><strong>Sea anemones</strong> are the marine, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria. Sea anemones are classified in the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. As cnidarians, sea anemones are related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones, and Hydra. Unlike jellyfish, sea anemones do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Sea cucumbers</strong> are echinoderms from the class Holothuroidea. They are marine animals with a leathery skin and an elongated body containing a single, branched gonad. The number of holothurian species worldwide is about 1,717 with the greatest number being in the Asia Pacific region.</p>\n<p><strong>Muraena </strong>is a genus of twelve species of large eels in the family Muraenidae. This genus is common in the Mediterranean, and is abundantly represented in tropical and subtropical seas. Fun fact: One species, the California moray eel (Gymnothorax mordax), has an extra set of depressible teeth in the tops of their mouths.</p>\n<p><strong>Squid </strong>are cephalopods in the superorder Decapodiformes with elongated bodies, large eyes, eight arms and two tentacles.</p>\n<p><strong>Lophius piscatorius</strong>, commonly known as the angler, is a monkfish in the family Lophiidae. It is found in coastal waters of the northeast Atlantic, from the Barents Sea to the Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. They are usually colored to blend into the background. These strange looking fish have a stout body, a large head, and an enormous mouth.</p>\n<p><strong>The giant squid (Architeuthis dux)</strong> is a species of deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae. It can grow to a 12\u201313 m (39\u201343 ft). The giant squid have the largest eyes out of any animal in the world. They can be as large as a dinner plate. They function to detect the small amounts of light in the deep (including bioluminescent light).</p>\n<p><strong>The sperm whale or cachalot (Physeter macrocephalus)</strong> is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. Plunging to 2,250 metres (7,382 ft), it is the third deepest diving mammal, exceeded only by the southern elephant seal and Cuvier's beaked whale.</p>\n<p><strong>The seafolk</strong> - a species still unknown to science.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:53:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/359/359943f98e0e1e6cf06d5b917df8804d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Valeriy Petrov"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
