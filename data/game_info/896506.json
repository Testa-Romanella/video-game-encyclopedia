Plus, you'll have access to the scoring system.</p>\n<p>The controls are:</p>\n<p><strong>D: Right</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A: Left</strong></p>\n<p>You must move the windows around to create a path. Get to the yellow square to get to the next level (there are 5, you can select any of them, but by doing that you'll not be able to use the score system)</p>\n<p><em><strong>I'm sorry if the HTML version works so bad.
