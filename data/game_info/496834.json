All of the base gameplay from those tutorials is included. However, I have expanded upon the game with two modes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Mode</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Challenge mode is the game as it was originally meant to be played. Your goal is to destroy enemy ships and asteroids. You die in one hit, so evasion is key.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Easy Mode</strong><br/></p>\n<p>One of the two modes I added to the game. The goals are the same as they are in challenge mode. However, instead of dying in one hit, you have a health bar. This makes the game more inviting to newcomers.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reverse Mode</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Shooting asteroids as a space ship is fun and all, but what about destroying space ships as an asteroid? Ram into dozens of tiny ships to increase your score. As your health decreases, so will your size, so be careful.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T03:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b0/7b0cc4128e487ea877d6f450b032993f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lena Taylor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
