This was made in under a day, don't expect miracles. I'm amazed it works at all frankly.<br/></p>\n<p>The aim of the game is simple: Play cards to buy cards to play more powerful cards to either kill your opponent or be the first to play the ender dragon. <br/><br/>Equipped with a horrible AI opponent that at least somewhat works, and no instructions how to play because I frankly had no time for it.</p>\n\n<p>Click your cards to play them, click the cards in the center row closest to you to buy that card if you can afford it, click the locations under to go to different worlds with different cards to buy, click your opponent heart to attack, burn your hand to get rid of old useless cards, and click \"end turn\" to end turn. This isn't that complicated, even if very rushed and barely working. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T06:43:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/357/357f26a526671d5207be83894e091e18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MMagnusson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
