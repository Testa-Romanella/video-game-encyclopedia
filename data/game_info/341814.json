And they attack!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: <br/>* Tap an empty space next to your orbz to spawn a new orb; or tap an orb to activate a jump move then tap a space up to 2 spaces away to move. <br/>* Spawning an orb diagonally, vertically or horizontally next to another player\u2019s orbz will cause a flip reaction - and you take control of their orbz. <br/>* You must make a move if one is available. If no moves are available, it will activate Orbz Attack, spawning the opposing player\u2019s orbz on all the remaining spaces on the board.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: <br/>* Overtake your opponents by having the most orbz on the board! <br/>* Special Moves: As you progress, special moves become available on the board. Spawn an orb on these spaces to activate them and cause various flip reactions to gain an edge on your opponent.<br/>* Use a Nuke Power-Up to auto-complete levels! The more you win, the more you earn.<br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/>* 3 Game Modes: Arcade, Classic &amp; Free Play<br/>* 50 Levels in Arcade Mode<br/>* Unlimited Randomized Levels in Free Play Mode<br/>* 12 Trophies", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T05:45:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5e/a5e0ef444eb973eb487c2507ea04e0c3.jpg", "website": "http://www.KillerBytesGames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["KillerBytes"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Brandon Velazquez"], "esrb_rating": null}
