After deciding to ignore the warning of her elders about wandering around after dark, Sara decides to take an adventure into the forest. What will she learn? What will she find? Join her on her adventure into unknown, but remember, some things are better left In The Dark.<br/></p><p>This was my first attempt at trying to make a functioning 2D platforming game. Safe to say that I think I pulled SOME of it off. It's not complete and nowhere near where I thought I would have it, but I like it. It shows tenacity... or something like that. Definitely was a trial trying my best to get all the code to work, but at least it functions. Thanks if you try it, it's kind of boring though and a little broken.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T16:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1be/1bebf2bae839a25cb63ea5409ac40d6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jellybiscuits"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
