With the theme\u00a0<em>Roll of the Dice</em>, you play as a die (dice?) stuck in a graveyard full of undead (dice) gunslingers! Fight for survival with your weapons and dodge bullets with a mighty roll.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be careful, however, as your weapon is based on the roll of the dice. Make sure to roll yourself and don't let the enemies roll you!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Felix Liu (@felixryliu)\u00a0\u2014 Literally Everything<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Author's Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out (and hopefully playing)\u00a0<em>Day of the Die</em>! When I was developing the game, I made a rookie mistake and accidentally spent the evening of the first day prototyping a 2.5D dice system. Due to my terrible decisions, the game is not quite what I anticipated to make (Particularly in the graphics and AI portions). However, I hope that it is still good enough and that you have had fun playing it!<br/></p>\n<p>\u2014 Felix<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T05:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfc/bfc45fd1490a30b6d1d618a7b16cfaee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chill"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
