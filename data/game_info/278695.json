Since the bullets ricochet, you must find the perfect angle and take out at least a couple of zombies per shot. Aiming your sights straight on just one zombie usually defeats the purpose, and with a varying amount of ammunition within each challenge, precision is pretty important. Once the zombies are exterminated, one to three stars will be given out based on the number of bullets used, and a certain number of score are needed to make it to the next level.</p>\n<p>The different levels of the game offer different challenges by the way the barriers are position. The barriers and metal and sometimes have small gaps in them for the bullets to go through.\u00a0<br/>Only a set number of bullets are given her round, in addition a special bullet can be used only once, but it limits the number of assignable stars<br/>\u00a0When the bullets are gone the level needs to be reset.More points for killing more than one zombie with a single bullet.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f42/f42b3e5d62cf8498df965e150d813b5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["luclabgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
