So <strong>left is right</strong> and <strong>right is left</strong>. Additionally, you must <strong>collect the coins</strong> that spawn within 3 seconds. <strong>If you don't, then you fall into the clouds</strong>.</p>\n<p>A gameover screen was implemented, but I\u00a0ran out of time to make it work properly. So simply reload the game or browser window to keep playing.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T05:26:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f53/f538e3cfc46c0c65763451d7ffcccf8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Stephen Pearce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
