How would you do it? What would you use? This is the position Antonio Fiasco finds himself in. Some shady distant cousins have somehow come into possession of valuable and famous works of art that have been curiously damaged. They seem to misunderstand Antonio's arts degree, which is in culinary, and are employing his services to repair their strangely familiar pieces of artwork. Anyway, they're paying and Antonio isn't asking any questions!<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Freeform painting system.<br/></li><li>Dynamic fluids.<br/></li><li>Liquid mixing.<br/></li><li>Variety of Tools and Equipment.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The restoration process is delicate and complex. There are many specialized processes and tools that Antonio is completely oblivious of. Instead, improvisation is key. There are a variety of items available in the garage to (hopefully) aid in the restoration process. The items come in the form of tools, various liquids, containers, food, and whatever else you find in the nooks and crannies of the garage.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T04:27:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4aff05fdb08bfcefb86a37fccb79d908.jpg", "website": "https://www.fiascorestoration.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fowl Machinations"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fowl Machinations"], "esrb_rating": null}
