As part of security you're dispatched to see why contact has been lost. Be careful out there !</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay and controls :</strong></p>\n<p>Usual PC Fps stuff, Use the mouse to look around and aim, use your<strong> WASD</strong> keys to move, Spacebar to interract. (<strong>Important Sidenote</strong>, odd thing i discovered too late, you can't use the numbered keys on a web build apparently so you'll have to put <strong>Caps Lock</strong> on to use the <strong>numbers 0 through 6</strong> to switch between weapons, sorry )</p>\n<p>Gameplay wise it's a very basic attempt at a doom clone so the goal is simple, find the exit door, any necessary keycards required to open locked doors, shoot any monster you encounter and collect weapons and powerups.</p>\n<p><strong>Credit on some Ressources :</strong></p>\n<p>External stuff :</p><p>Font is \"Orbitron\" from Google fonts</p><p>Jam Logo\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the rest of the assets, level geometry, textures, sprites sfx etc are done solo during the jam's time.</p>\n<p><strong>Programs Used :</strong></p>\n<p>Blender, Godot engine, Gimp, LMMS.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy what's there, have a good one :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T12:37:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e4dc9309db677225833995fa1a2eefe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelMetalWolf"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
