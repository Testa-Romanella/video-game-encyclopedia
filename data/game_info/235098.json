{"id": 235098, "slug": "the-viking-game", "name": "The Viking Game", "name_original": "The Viking Game", "description": "The Viking Game is a recreation of the ancient Tafl board games that were played across northern Europe and beyond.  They were first played over 1500 years ago, and the last historically recorded game was in 1732.  These games share some similarities to games such as Chess.  However, these games are highly unusual in having two unevenly matched sides which are in trying to outwit each other in a strategic battle of siege warfare. <br/><br/>This App currently features the strongest A.I. player ever developed to play these games on any platform.  The A.I.Player itself is fully implemented to play a variety of different rules options.  The A.I. player also plays to different strengths which are user selectable based upon a combination of Consistency, Concentration, Creativity, Attack and Defence.  It also fully implements the alternative strategies and tactics required to achieve the alternative winning strategies for both the attackers, and the defenders.  The A.I. Player therefore greatly assists in the understanding and applying the strategic play for these games, which is otherwise not well understood.  The essence of strategy is also key to ensuring an even balance of play for what is otherwise a game of asymmetry.<br/><br/>The iPad version of this App also fully implements a range of historically documented Tafl boards ranging from 9 x 9 squares in size up to the recently unearthed 15 x 15 board found at Coppergate in York. The 15 x 15 boards in particular have never previously been presented on any other App. <br/><br/>Also included is a fully customisable board feature.  This lets you try out any conceivable starting piece layout.  This is also useful for trying out different scenarios identified from previously played games.  These boards and piece set ups can also be played against the A.I. Player.  The A.I. Player can also play against itself, which can be insightful for seeing how different board set ups and rules settings affect the balance of play. <br/><br/>This App also demonstrates that the historically documented rules work exceptionally well.  It is therefore a game which is simple to understand, but takes time and practice to master.   The games themselves can be deeply engaging and often require a lot of thought.  Like chess it is played best when planning moves in anticipation of what response your opponent may deliver. The A.I. player itself can actively plan many moves ahead of what is set out on the board.<br/><br/>All in all, this App aims to recreate the ancient Tafl games, and to convincingly demonstrate that it is ultimately the skill of the player that determines the outcome of the game, and not just the power of the King, or how many pieces you have at your disposal.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e721b21aefe54e4d31e60bda2595e5_slZaBC6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mike Fearn"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Mike Fearn"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
