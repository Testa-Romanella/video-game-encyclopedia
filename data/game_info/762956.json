With three different places to go, and a handful of different endings will you be able to handle the heat, or will you be forced to leave the kitchen?</em><br/></p>\n<p>TW: This game features a few scenes with minor sexual harassment but nothing too major happens.</p>\n\n<p>Devil Datin' is a short mostly kinetic novel about you- the player - taking the devil out on a date. It has around a 15 minute playtime and absolutely adorable chibi-like sprites.\u00a0 It was made for Nanoreno.</p>\n<p>As of right now only two of the three possible dates and endings are finished (though the last ones will be finished over the coming days). More choices and dialogue will be added to flesh out the story even more after that's finished as well!</p>\n<p>A special thank you to our artist\u00a0mai_naymuh for making the menu screen and all of our wonderful sprites!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, a big thank you goes to\u00a0Ari our writer and programmer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here's a document listing all of the licenses for the backgrounds and music.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T19:18:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a7/7a799f4ae809edb23cceb245b835278d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BaphoWorks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
