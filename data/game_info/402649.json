Red squares are teleporters that either teleport you to the next level or to a specified location. White boxes are movable and sometimes need pushing more than once. The final level is more difficult but once you discover it's secret, it becomes easy.</p>\n<p>Despite appearances, the main menu is navigated by the ball and not by the mouse. Simply roll into the buttons to use them, same with any other objects in the game.</p>\n<p>Created using unity 2018.2.2f1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:12:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/8352e22eeedee22f6c983eb3bb30c433.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["JamesSpencer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
