My brother asked my help with a school project, so I came up with the ideas and designed everything on the game for him, he in return programmed everything I asked him to. But as it turns out, all the files for the game were lost, including my paper drawings of the levels; the only thing that survived was a video of my brother skipping every puzzle easily. And that is where I picked up the project again, I remade everything, added graphics, (even with many being just a flat color, it is an improvement\u00a0from the original,) and the only reference I had was my memory and a video that shows\u00a0 like half of each level and ignores actual puzzle solving... Not so bad of a result from those conditions.</p>\n<p>I am no programmer, and I am no pixel artist. The game has no audio, I ran out of code with the free trial of Construct, there are\u00a0 a few\u00a0ways to get softlocked, I probably missed some bugs, and the puzzles are bad. But I made a game OMG. Or something that resembles a game.\u00a0And I'm glad I did. I always had a passion for Game Design, and I am proud to have made something all by myself, even if it's not good at all. It's my first time after all.</p>\n<p>With that said, I should probably re-do those puzzles,\u00a0 they are quite old,\u00a0 and made by\u00a0\u00a0younger\u00a0me... The first ones are way too handholdy, and stay in this \"tutorial difficulty\" for too long.\u00a0I should\u00a0substitute those for new and improved iterations. I will look into that for the future. Also add more Levels that were not in the original... Maybe bigger Levels, bring forth the Labyrinth part.<br/></p>\n<p>So... the game has in fact a story. I have no way to tell the story on the game itself at the moment, and I won't until I buy the full version of\u00a0Construct, or something... but it exists I swear. The in game objects are not random that is for sure. I'm a writer just trust me... Storytelling is my thing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T11:05:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b7/1b73cad0726d1630cc119d4ae25eee8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marcelinho3Dplus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
