The graphics are modified Wizardry/Cirnozardry graphics outright, but the way the dungeon is drawn and presented differs as many quality of life changes/etc were added as well as vast improvements to how the dungeon is rendered, the viewing distance for doors and events, as well as other changes.</p>\n\n<p>MUSIC CREDITS</p>\n<p>- 99% Dova Syndrome music</p>\n<p>- 1% some song I got from \u5275\u9020\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30a2</p>\n\n<p>SFX</p>\n<p>- VIPRPG sozai collection (can't remember which one)</p>\n\n<p>GUEST APPEARANCE</p>\n<p>- Maura (Shoukanshi/Majo, but a lot less gaki than before)</p>\n\n<p>FACES</p>\n<p>- 100% Artflow Ai generated images except for ones that were obviously photoshopped to all hell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T16:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2ad3469de0ae29095ab19fa05ef1ab39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Goburinbro"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
