The game has a strange control scheme where wasd corresponds to the movement of one boat and the aiming of the other and vice versa for the arrow keys. This is supposed to give a challenging single player experience, or a frustratingly-fun co-op experience. I created this game in a week using my free time. I created this game in Unity, and I created the art assets in Photoshop.\u00a0</p><p>Github:\u00a0https://github.com/srl447/Bubb...</p><p>Music: http://www.purple-planet.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/956/956d11a7bb61ba00e1f79f154790f1a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sam Leiman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
