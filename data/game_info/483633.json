Theme:\u00a0Spooky!/Cursed! (I misread it at first, it still kind of works I think)</p>\n<p>You've been locked in a CURSED room (nailed it) with zombies coming at you from every direction! The more you hit them, the less you can see them as it wears your flashlight out. If you rest for a bit it will recharge, but how long can you wait before they eat your brains?</p>\n<p>Use WASD or the directional keys to move, and use a mouse/trackpad to attack in the direction you're facing. Score is based on how long you survive and how many zombies you defeat. Good luck!</p>\n<p>High scores aren't recorded, so if you think you did well, please share your score\u00a0in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/78057890ce413d6d20929482096afc9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Will Thomas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
