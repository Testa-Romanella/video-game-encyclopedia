It's about helping animals collect their food. The theme \"start small\" is interpreted quite literally as the animals grow when they get fed. I also used a lot of directional sound with the objects of the game.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun making this game and I am quite proud of what I was able to accomplish. All of the code and art was made by me in the last 5 days but none of the sounds belong to me.<br/>Thank You for stopping by and trying my little game :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T15:20:59", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jamie of rivia"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
