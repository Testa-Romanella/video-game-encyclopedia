Plug up the melting ice with anything you can find to stop a hungry cat from eating you!\r\n\n<p>A simple one-button physics game about using your momentum, rotation, etc. to whack junk into melting ice to plug it up! The ice is melting, though, so it's only a matter of time before there's no ice left to plug up if you don't maintain it enough! Once the ice melts, there's nothing to stop the hungry cat from catching you, and then it's game over!</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>One button (click on desktop or tap on mobile)</li><li>Fun physics go ping pong</li><li>Sfx go ding</li><li>Beginner baby's unknowledgeable attempt at sprite stacking</li><li>Cool music (a bit crunchy on mobile the first pass through, because Godot web builds :/ )</li><li>Probably colorblind friendly? I didn't check yet, but I used the same palettes I always do, except for the gradient background</li></ul>\r\nInformation:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Fish:\u00a0</strong>This is you. Click/tap where you want to go, and the fish will spin towards that spot!</li><li><strong>Kelp:\u00a0</strong>Pretty bad at patching the hole, doesn't do much for your score either, but it's the easiest thing to whack!</li><li><strong>Boot:\u00a0</strong>Also pretty bad for score, but patches the ice pretty decently!</li><li><strong>Grail:\u00a0</strong>The Holy Grail! Or, well, one of many floating around in your pond.\u00a0 It's the best for your score, but patches worse than kelp.</li><li><strong> Gold:\u00a0</strong>Pretty good for score, but only patches as well as kelp.</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Anchor: </strong>These heavy sunsa guns are the best for patching up the ice! Not shabby for your score, either, although not as nice as the Grail.</li></ul>\r\nTools:\r\n<ul><li>Engine: Godot 3.4.4</li><li>Music: Beepbox.co</li><li>Sfx: Audacity &amp; hitting a random cup on my desk with a pen</li><li>Art: Paint.net</li></ul>\r\nSoundtrack:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Menu\r\n    Level\r\n    Game over\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    It's just drums\r\n    Exported with 2 loops\r\n    I had to figure out the tempo again oops might be off a lil but the bytes matched exactly when I exported again so I think i managed to find it\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nalso, if you enjoyed this game,\r\n<p>it would mean a lot to my family if you helped out with our fundraiser!\u00a0my mom passed away this year &amp; we held her funeral already, but we still owe the funeral home a lot of money!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T17:09:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce7e86c60e66d95f8915f311372051fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["papabirb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
