The goal is to make as many points as you can. For that you can catch grapes in mid-air, and avoid rotten ones. Starlings gather when any grape hits the ground, but after certain points you get a pistol so you can drive them away.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls for keyboard:</strong></p>\n<p>arrows left - right, or A - D: move left - right</p>\n<p>Space: jump</p>\n<p>Enter: shoot pistol (if avialable)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls for gamepad:</strong></p>\n<p>sticks or Dpad left - right: move left - right</p>\n<p>A: jump</p>\n<p>Right Trigger:\u00a0shoot pistol (if avialable)</p>\n<p><strong>This is a minigame</strong>, the first one I actually finished in GMS2.\u00a0It was not just a practice project for coding but for having try out some strange mechanics, not ordinary in a platformer like game.
