The theme of \"Start with nothing\" sparked a memory in my head of a physics video I had watched a couple of months prior, about a subject way far from my understanding, yet still interesting to me. The theory, called \"Leptogenesis\", is as far as I understand it about an imbalance of matter and antimatter versions of elementary particles called leptons in the very early stages of the universe. This would in turn lead to a larger amount of matter in the universe compared to antimatter, explaining why there seems to be so much more of it today. I don't know how correct that description was, but the game isn't an accurate depiction of the theory anyway, although I did draw inspiration from i</em>t.<br/><br/><em>In any case, I hope you'll find it fun to play</em><em>!\u00a0</em>\n<p><strong>One of the most fundamental philisophical questions of our time is: Why is there something, rather than nothing?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Leptogenesis is a theory in physics which aims to give an answer, in physical terms: Why does the observable universe have more antimatter than matter? This game is (loosely!) based on this idea, as your mission is to separate antimatter and matter, both created out of nothing, in order to gain a surplus of matter, something. You do this by forcing them apart and preventing them from combining once more, again becoming nothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Note: I absolutely do not have enough knowledge of physics to actually understand this idea, so take it with a grain of salt! \ud83d\ude05 The game isn't meant to be an accurate representaion of the theory, and I hope any physics majors that happen to play it won't be too discouraged</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T07:38:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5ef0762c53c78ad2155bf328ff289107.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NiKaDra"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
