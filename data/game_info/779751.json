Based on a variety of different teas, it originated as a children&#39;s toy franchise by (J) SEGA Toys, but has since branched out among Nintendo gaming consoles.</h2>\n<p>Being one of the first video game titles to be released for the franchise, the game opens to an isometric room that the player can use to adopt and foster &quot;ocha-ken&quot; (tea dogs/puppies), as well as having the option for tea cats (ocha-neko). Similar to a dollhouse setting, the player can place and move objects (e.g. furniture, food and toys) to decorate these rooms, which can either be purchased, unlocked through minigames, or received as a reward as the game progresses. These objects can sometimes prompt a unique interaction between it and the pet as they wander around the room.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T21:59:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df8/df8a63cd15ec9288accb7426e26a8e68.jpg", "website": "http://www.ocha-ken.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["MTO"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["MTO"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
