Sometimes a meteor will fly across the sky. Turn down the lights, bring a blanket and snacks, and enjoy</em> Meteor Night <em>together.</em>\n<p>A game based on the Famicase \"Meteor Night\"\u00a0for the \"Chill\"-themed A Game By Its Cover jam 2018.</p>\n\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>There's a meteor shower coming, and you take your friend or date stargazing after dark. They've never gone stargazing before, so you'll have to point out any meteors you see to your friend or date.</p>\n<p>It's chilly outside, so make sure you keep your friend or date warm. If they see a beautiful meteor, they will forget the cold for a little while; if they keep missing meteors you point out, they'll grow frustrated and cold.<br/></p>\n<p>Eventually, though, they'll probably want to go home. Maybe to your place?</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Using a mouse is recommended for precision and speed. Don't miss the meteors!</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Mouse / arrow keys:\u00a0</strong>Look around the sky</li><li><strong>Left click / X: </strong>Point out meteor</li></ul>\r\nChill/Chill Out\r\n<p>Press <strong>C</strong> on the title screen to toggle between Chill mode and Chill Out mode.<br/></p>\n<p>In the default Chill mode, your friend or date will get colder with time. Point out as many meteors as you can to get a new high score.</p>\n<p>In Chill Out mode, it's a warm, summer night; you won't get cold, and can just chill out as long as you want to. High score is not tracked in this mode.</p>\n\r\nCredits and links\r\nFamicase\r\n<p>Title screen and cartridge art by Ashley Davis, based on an idea by Eric Caoili and JC Fletcher of Tiny Cartridge, used with permission.</p>\n<ul><li>Famicase exhibit</li><li><em>Meteor Night</em> blog reveal</li><li><em>Meteor Night</em> blog post</li></ul>\r\nOther assets\r\n<ul><li><strong>Music: </strong>\"Arpument\" from <em>9 Songs in PICO-8</em>\u00a0by Robby Duguay, used under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</li><li><strong>Website background image:\u00a0</strong>\"Summer Starry Sky\" by jyryk58, used under CC BY 2.0 (desaturated from original).</li></ul>\r\nOther games\r\n<p>This is far from the first game based on this Famicase, but I wanted to make one that matched the description a little more closely.
