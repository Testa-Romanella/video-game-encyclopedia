Becky must also destroy the Robotic Pterodactyl Boss in order to save the galaxy.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>\n<p>This is an updated version of the original project which was revised by Luis Ramos because he was given peer feedback to develop missing elements within the project. He redesigned the level backgrounds, and the main ship to reduce distractions while keeping the art style consistent.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0He also added a score chart for game rewards. Luis Ramos was also responsible for the adding illustrated images such as a diamond to represent a power up collectable and a spiral portal to represent a gateway to the next level.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luis Ramos was also responsible for updating the user interface by changing the colors, and fonts of the text to present a consistent menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please watch the original Video of the Project that inspired these changes and understand the original contexts from the original team behind the project.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8ZnrB_MToI</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Arlyn Elopre\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Arlyn Elopre was responsible for the programing background music with the Apple GarageBand software. Her soundtrack was used for the first two level. Then, she also produced an intense theme soundtrack for the last level which was the boss battle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arlyn was also originally responsible for coding the game's movement controls, the ship shooting lasers, title screen, and the user interface instructions. Arlyn also coded enemies positioned in one area, and portals that help the level transitions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arlyn also originally created the hearts, and heart outlines with Adobe Illustrator. She also coded the health bar interface that responds to damage collision whenever the ships gets hit by any Artificial Intelligent (AI) enemies or obstacles within all levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Jelani Kennedy\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Jelani Kennedy was originally responsible for creating the space theme backgrounds with Adobe Illustrator. Jelani also originally designed the Spaceship with Adobe Illustrator.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jelani constructed two different backgrounds, the one, with multiple planets, was used for the first two levels. The other one, with a close-up view of planet Earth, was used for the Boss level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jelani also coded his backgrounds into the game's level backgrounds that moved across the screen. Jelani was also responsible for coding the level transitions by putting all the levels together in order.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Luis Ramos\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Luis Ramos was responsible for creating the Artificial Intelligent (AI) obstacles, and enemies with Adobe Illustrator. He was responsible for creating the asteroids for the first level, and the Robot Pterodactyls for the second level. Luis also created circular spikes, and the Robot Pterodactyl Boss for the last level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luis also coded the ship's damage collision which involved the Spaceship losing a life bar whenever it gets hit by any AI enemy or obstacle. He also coded countless asteroids that move across the user interface screen for the game's first level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luis also used Processing to code 15 enemies within the second level. Luis was also responsible for constructing the boss battle level by coding spikes that move across the screen. In addition, Luis also coded the Boss Pterodactyl to repeatedly move up, and down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I give a huge special thank you for Arlyn Elopre, and Jelani Kennedy for their strong team efforts to complete this project.
