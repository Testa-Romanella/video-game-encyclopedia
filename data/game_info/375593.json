We were tasked with exploring \"fun\" mechanics, so we decided to keep it simple and take 2 classic games (snake and frogger) and combine them and out hatched Mother Clucker!</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to collect chicks and return them to the coop to score enough points to reach and stay above the changing target goal. The longer the chain of chicks, the higher the multiplier! However, speeding tractors and bouncing hay bales can kill your chicks, deducting from your score! Throwing chicks directly to the coop can score you some extra points to beat the buzzer, but there is no score multiplier when you do so. You can also stack your chicks safely above you to avoid their impending doom, but you can not move while they are stacked. How long can you last!?!</p>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<ul><li>arrow keys to move</li><li>left-click to launch chick</li><li>right-click to stack chicks</li></ul>\r\nThe Team:\r\n<p>Zach Karlins: Project Lead/Sounds</p>\n<p>Chesalon Taylor: Mad Programming Skills</p>\n<p>Eva Camba Perez: 3D Modeling/UI Art</p>\n<p>Jarrett Rhodes: Level/Environment Design</p>\n<p>Kenneth Morrison: Animations</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T05:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/887/887b45e50ff6261417ef62daf55433b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jrhodes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
