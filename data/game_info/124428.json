(?_?)</p><p>The noise snow was made by taking a photo of the job posting, using hex-editors to turn it into a glitchy mess, then feeding that mess into RPG Maker as a tileset. \\(^_^)/</p><p>The song of the Tundra was made by turning the photo into a BMP and feeding that as raw data into Audacity then doing some various audio noodling to make it sound bearable. \\(^_^)/</p><p>WHAT DO YOU DO IN IT?
