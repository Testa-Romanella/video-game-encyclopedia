In this game, you need to fight against evil monsters that their boss set up against you. At the end, you face the boss himself. Every round, lasts 30 seconds. Depending on what monsters you kill, you get a different score. After the time ran out, you can buy yourself new weapons and get powerups. Depending on your score, you fight in different worlds. With every world you get closer to the boss. But if you e.g. buy yourself a new stronger weapon, your score will drop and it might be, that you are send to lower worlds. So depending on your score, the world depends. Better weapons, or better worlds? It is completely up to you...</p>\n<p>Watch the official trailer for Powershot here:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Interested in how I made this game? Watch the making of\u00a0here:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is my first indie game, that I am releasing. I hope you like it. In total I worked almost two months on it, so supporting my work (e.g. through subscribing to my YouTube-Channel would be very much appreciated, but of course you don't have to. Downloading is more than enough and means a lot to me).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T05:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/768f741bcbe2b2af10340c856d91d6f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shiny_Emerald_Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
