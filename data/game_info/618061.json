In the beginning we can only pick up a few crystals. We have to grow our own swarm, so we can absorb bigger swarms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, we use entities from our swarm as ammo, to repair our ship and to open doors.<strong> It is important to find the right balance between using crystals from our own swarm and collect new ones.</strong> The interactions we can take in the game are directly connected, i.e. joinded together with our swarm, as this is the resource we take all our actions froms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The single crystals are physically joined together as a swarm/wobbely-floating-heap and indicate the amout of resources we can spend in a diegetic way.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning: There is no pause menu yet, and the game sometimes does weird things on minimizing. So better don't do that ;) ... I may provide an update for this in the upcoming days.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>W: Forward<br/>S: Break<br/>A: Strife Left<br/>D: Strife Right<br/>Q/E: Roll<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse: Steering</p>\n<p>Left Mouse: Shoot<br/>Right Mouse: Zoom In to First Person<br/>R: Repair Ship<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Damiano Baldoni - Ambient1<br/>Damiano Baldoni - Ambient2<br/>Meyd\u00e4n - Elk<br/>Music downloaded from:\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:11:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab503b9b656f3f3cfb1440e2b754d395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Farry1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
