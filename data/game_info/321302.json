{"id": 321302, "slug": "to-the-dark-tower", "name": "To The Dark Tower", "name_original": "To The Dark Tower", "description": "In 1855, the noted Victorian poet Robert Browning had a nightmare. His terrifying dream took the form of a poem, and upon awakening, he wrote it down verbatim. This strange dream-poem would become known as \"Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came,\" considered by many to be one of the greatest works of poetry in the English language.This is a personal interpretation of that poem.<br/>I first read this masterpiece during a very difficult time in my life, and I want to share some of the beauty and insight I gained from it. To achieve this end, I have illustrated, animated, or otherwise represented each line in the format of a \"visual novel,\" to best show you what I see in my mind's eye when reading it. Hopefully you can gain something of use, or perhaps just beauty, from this experience.<br/><br/>Yours,<br/>-Yitz", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2a/c2ad5d4263ec8f340896705f620b546d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Yitz"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["yours truly"], "esrb_rating": null}
