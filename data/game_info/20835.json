The pyramid was erected almost half a century prior to his death, on a piece of land that Stierngranat bought close to his home. He also had his own personalised coffin built, which he always took on trips, even shorter ones.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCarol is contacted by the cleaner George in the middle of a cold Swedish winter.
