Full credits provided in game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game Description:</strong></p>\n<p>You play as Lykke Caspersen, employee of Europa Research Company and pilot of the delivery submarine Hermes. For the coming month you will drive between the various research facilities beneath the ice on Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa. However, during a visit at the deepest of the facilities a giant sea-monster emerges and starts attacking the facilities. It becomes your primary objective to evacuate all the researchers before they are eaten.</p>\n<p>The caves under the ice form winding paths, making navigation one of the primary challenges of the game. Additionally, the caves house various dangers that must be handled in some way. Narrow paths and floating blocks of ice require some piloting skills, but the main threat are the predators. To avoid being eaten, the player must adapt to avoid attracting the various hunters in the depths. Some fish hunts anything that makes loud noises, while others attack shining lights.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse and keyboard.
