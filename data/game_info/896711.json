The original menu-based adventure game has been revamped with a new script, new graphics, new sounds, and a new battle system. First-time buyers can just think of this as the first adventure of the Rance series, and players familiar with the original can enjoy the changes that have been made to the characters and story.\nGameplay\nFor the most part, this is an adventure game where your choices determine what actions you take to progress through the story. And obviously, danger goes hand in hand with adventure. Some choices might lead to you taking damage and dying unexpectedly, while others might lead to fortuitous encounters... Enjoy the game by taking plenty of detours along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDungeons where monsters appear, like forests or caves, are represented by cards. Will you fight a monster? Find treasure? Fall into a trap? Choose cards carefully when proceeding to your destination. If the card is face-down, you won't know what it's hiding. It could be rare treasure, or a powerful monster...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you encounter a monster, a battle using weapon and shield \"chips\" begins. Will you play multiple weapons for a powerful attack, throw in shields for defense, save disposable weapons for an all-out attack, or do something else entirely... Well planned combos are the name of the game here. Though, that doesn't mean brute forcing it won't work. Buy weapons and shields at the shop to put together your own unique style of combat.\nStory\nBrutal warrior Rance's mind is filled to the brim with thoughts of fucking girls. And wherever he goes, screams of beautiful women resound.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe's been traveling around randomly with the mage girl he recently bought, Sill, but now he has a different purpose in mind. His target this time... Or rather, his destination, is the Kingdom of Leazas, which is known to be the most wealthy nation in the world. The daughter of a noble family, Hikari, who attended Paris Academy there, has gone missing, and he's taken up a quest to find her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRance sets off to enjoy the beauties of Leazas!<br/>\n...And while he's there, he'll find Hikari and enjoy her too, of course.<br/>\n \nRance 02 -The Rebellious Maidens-\n<br/>\nThe peerless warrior Rance is a great fighter, a quick thinker, and possessed of powerful luck. These qualities alone would mark him as a hero to go down in history, but unfortunately, he has no interest in using his talents for such things as world peace or justice, and acts only to fulfill his own desires. Now, the town of Custom is in danger, and the one who's accepted a quest at the guild to help them is none other than Rance (and his helper Sill).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that Rance is on the job, Custom is saved! ...Or is it?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-08T01:03:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62e/62e814df16595984e46b9753631e3103.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 502, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alicesoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["MangaGamer"], "esrb_rating": null}
