Planet Minesweeper takes the classic timewasting gameplay of Minesweeper and wraps it around a spherical planet!<br/><br/>\"looks awesome, even to a person who's already played Minesweeper for hundreds of hours. That\u2019s precisely the same old good game, but with the HD graphics and spherical (aka planet-like) gameplay field. Find mines, flag them, take a guess and die horribly. Fun, fun time.\"<br/>--AppSale Review<br/><br/>\"A brilliant take on an old classic... A brilliant challenge, but easy to get into if you\u2019re waiting for the train or just have some minutes to kill....the game provides a challenge, and is very entertaining.
