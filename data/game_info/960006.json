{"id": 960006, "slug": "antbassador-2", "name": "Antbassador", "name_original": "Antbassador", "description": "Today is the day The Antbassador will come, to speak words of peace with Her Majesty Queen Antoinette IV. The Kingdom of Antopia has finally grown accustomed to a life without war, and its people are willing to forge an alliance with their one-time foe. If The Antbassador is good and kind, he might well see their worlds connected.<br/><br/>Take control of The Antbassador, a giant human finger with a tophat, as he makes his way through a bustling ant colony. His massive bulk makes him strong but unwieldy, and if you're not careful you're liable to squish your tiny hosts! You must use your prodigious digit to help the citizens of Antopia without causing an international incident!<h3>CONTROLS: </h3>Move the mouse to push yourself here and there. <br/><br/>Click the mouse to curl your finger.<h3>FEATURES:</h3> <ul><li>5 minutes of fumblecore finger fun!<br/></li><li>Dozens of NPCs to avoid squishing!<br/></li><li>Reused assets from Octodad: Dadliest Catch!<br/></li><li>One climactic duel for the kingdom!</li></ul><h3>WHY DID WE MAKE THIS?</h3><br/>Antbassador is part of Young Horses: Free Range, where we collect our smaller side projects and release them for free!<br/><br/>Back in 2014 while freshly finished with Dadliest Catch, a portion of the Young Horses team decided to participate in the Ludum Dare game jam #30. The theme for the jam was 'Connected Worlds', which we interpreted fairly loosely. Over the course of 72 hours, we conceived and developed Antbassador using the Horsepower engine. To our delight, Antbassador took first place in the jam, scoring highly in innovation, humor, and fun!<br/><br/>So give it a try! It's free, so there's only so disappointed you can be!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-12T00:57:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a787bdd0094bff4c4a0dda2f1e14f16.jpg", "website": "https://younghorsesgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 66, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Young Horses", "Young Horses: Free Range"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Young Horses"], "esrb_rating": null}
