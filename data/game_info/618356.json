Play as a juvenile alien, tasked by the others in his ship to go fetch some humans - needing to hang from a length of rope to reach them.</p>\n<p>The game is single-player or co-op two-player. WASD controls an alien spacecraft, while arrow keys control the smaller alien - who can swing or climb on the rope. They're vulnerable to damage, so be careful with how you approach the dangerous terrain of Earth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:23:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/237b5ea9a525451d4bafd734e0fbce09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CrossfireCam", "benchi99", "Darelt", "frankbusquets", "\uff34\uff45\uff53\uff4c\uff41"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
