{"id": 402871, "slug": "lewd-battle-system", "name": "Lewd Battle System", "name_original": "Lewd Battle System", "description": "<p>A lewd battle system that uses turn-ons and turn-offs like pokemon types. Very early in development. If a move has a type that matches \u00a0a turn-on, the character gains +5 horny for each match. If a move has a type that matches a turn-off however, then the move fails completely.</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n<br/>-Left-click attacks to choose attack, then left-click a target to use move on that target.<br/>-Right-click on anyone to view their information.</p>\n<p>Features:\r\n<br/>-Futas and Traps (referred to as \"Pretty Boys\" in-game), though there arent any graphics yet, just an icon to represent characters, so you wont actually \"see\" any.\r\n<br/>-Different fantasy races, like cat people, sheep people, centaurs. (Some are labeled weird, like cat people as \"Cat\" and sheep people as \"Sheep\", dont be confused, these are suppose to be half-human, half-animal races)<br/>-Info Crits can sometimes happen when you successfully attack an enemy. When you right-click on an enemy, most of their turn-ons and turn-offs are hidden. When you Info Crit, you reveal one of that enemy's turn-ons or turn-offs.</p>\n<p>If you want to help support me and this project, please consider donating to my sites below.<br/>-Kofi: https://ko-fi.com/universalmonster<br/>-SubscribeStar: https://subscribestar.adult/universalmonster<br/>-NewProject2: https://newproject2.com/universalmonster/<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T03:00:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c0b94af662f559bef325d74b75c544e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UniversalMonster"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
