These are the\u00a0source of energy for your entire operation.\u00a0</p>\r\nBatteries:\r\n\n<p>Holds the excess electricity you've generated and provides the power\u00a0to all your other nodes.\u00a0</p>\r\nMiners:\r\n\n<p>Uses electricity to mine gold. Gold can be used to upgrade and purchase more units for your base.</p>\r\nBlasters:\r\n\n<p>Use these to pummel the enemy into dust! Powered by electricity.</p>\r\nNodes:\r\n<p>Used to connect stuff together and transport resources throughout your base.\u00a0</p>\r\nShield:\r\n<p>I ran out of time, so these were never implemented.\u00a0A crucial component to gameplay unfortunately. They absorb bullets before they hit your base, in return for some electricity. Make sure the perimeter of your base is using these!</p>\r\nFake Blasters:\r\n<p>Also not implemented due to time.\u00a0\u00a0These sneaky weapons use a much cheaper round that\u00a0actually do no damage, but trick shields into stopping them anyway (wasting the enemies\u00a0electricity).\u00a0</p>\r\nThe enemy\r\n\n<p>Eradicate them.</p>\r\nFeedback:\r\n\n<p>If you're interested in further development, want to give feedback, or want to see my other projects,\u00a0check out my discord.</p>\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nWarning:\r\n<p>If you still want to play\u00a0despite it being mostly broken, you're more than welcome to. Although I warn you, it's pretty janky because the controls were thrown in last minute.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Camera: </strong>middle mouse to zoom and pan, or you can use WASD or arrowkeys.</p>\n<p><strong>Build new unit: </strong>Click any node</p>\n<p><strong>Place different unit:</strong> O (while placing)</p>\n<p><strong>Cancel placement:</strong> Esc</p>\n<p><strong>Delete node: </strong>Delete</p>\n<p><strong>Multiselect:\u00a0</strong>shift</p>\n<p><strong>Aim blaster</strong>: i (works on multi selection too)</p>\n<p><strong>Debug info: </strong>Tab</p>\r\nTips and info:\r\n\n<p><strong>Use a single battery per base.</strong> If a battery runs out of power, all units connected to it will go offline and then queue to use the very slow pathfinding algorithm\u00a0to find another one with more charge. The algorithm for electricity distribution was very rushed.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The less nodes the better.</strong>\u00a0Make use of that length!\u00a0The more nodes there are, the more the pathfinding has to work and may produce weird results.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Bases are self sufficient! Also there's a bug where units are fully functional before\u00a0they're placed. But that's ok because I never had a chance to add prices so everything is free.</p>\n\n<p>You're not supposed to be able to place units like this</p>\n<p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>The game I submitted at 7:03pm crashed on launch. Thank you to Mark for giving us a secret extra 30 mins. That was really helpful.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This project took\u00a028 hours (I have a screen recording of it).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:57:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dc/6dca8c476aafa85d30dfad4a2e107e24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PelicanPolice"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
