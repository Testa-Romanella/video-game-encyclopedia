Icebreaking capability, performed contracts, required amount of money for construction and maintenance depend on these characteristics. You need to choose a specialized icebreaker to complete each contract: a tanker for oil, a passenger ship to transfer tourists etc.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChoose where you place your ships, which contracts are more profitable. Earn money, develop your fleet and docks, where the fleet stays and gets repaired.
