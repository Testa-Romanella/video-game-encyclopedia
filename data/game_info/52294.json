Unlike many multi-player games, it's not about kill or be killed but invite or be invited. Gossip is our weapon of choice. Instead of raids, we will have grand balls. Instead of dungeons, we will have dinner parties.<br/>\r\nThe village of Tyrehampton is centered round a tree-lined village green, with houses where you may own and redecorate to your taste any available terraced home as of our Open Beta Update 3 (Released 9 December 2016). Please feel free to role-play with your friends in and around the village. Drive a carriage to explore around the town or travel to the Estate for dancing. There are several \"stories\" to get you started. We are busy adding many more stories, dinner parties and other features for your enjoyment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/135/135c34f06465e3d3166159807bcee9d3.jpg", "website": "http://www.everjane.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Turn Productions"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Turn Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
