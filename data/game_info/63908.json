Think fast; every fleeting second may be your last. Survive waves of monsters. Survive all 11 stages. Survive until <strong>the end</strong>.<br/><br/>Ticktock is a unique action arcade avoidance game, where time pauses to give you a moment to evaluate the situation and plan your next move.<br/><br/>With five different monsters to fend off, and 11 different stages of increasing difficulty, a great challenge lies ahead. Each stage and monster is uniquely hand-crafted to be predictable, yet complex. Six different pieces play alongside each stage, complementing the aesthetic of the gameplay to form a complete experience.<br/><br/>Will you be able to survive? How long can you survive?<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9a55fc25a575c013abffa796501528e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petraller Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Petraller Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
