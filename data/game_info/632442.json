Well at least many people and probably you who entered this page. Yes...there are a lot of games where you can be the dragon, but either it is a 2D RPG game or simply the escence of a dragon is just not captured in the game experience. Well that is why I am releasing this prototype from a very early stage, and when I mean early, I mean it. Just look at the screenshots- The only part of the game developed is the dragon's movement, and that is why it is so critical for me\u00a0\u00a0to publish it. Creating the correct dragon movement is very important to continue on with the game. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Obviously I am writing a\u00a0 story for our Rhogor dragon. I am trying my best to make the most thrilling dragon. However, I would also love your ideas. What do you imagine when you think of the word dragon? I wise dragon? Or probably a giant roaring one?\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T05:04:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40b/40b8a0b3ac97600d9f6d284f7cbbd390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["knoware"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
