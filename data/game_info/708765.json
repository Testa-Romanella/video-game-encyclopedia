You can combine [S]+[K] or [A/D]+[K] to produce different moves!</li><li>Your health will be displayed in center bottom of the screen, along with your energy! Refuel your energy feeding on enemy bolts (using the proyectile void), and use it to exchange it for health in the random-spawning palm trees, or to release a powerful blast shot for half of your maximum mana, using [L]!</li><li>You can see a count of how many days have pass, you will see the count of how many you killed when you die! Would you set the maximum score?</li></ul>\n<p>This is entirely up to you, but BOBOB\u00d3 would have done it!</p><p>PS: I made this game 4 years ago, using a C framework (very limited) provided by the UM University, as a part of a degree subject.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75e/75e70544c4cf52113ce075aacb837ddb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kenkeh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
