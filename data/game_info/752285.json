{"id": 752285, "slug": "pethack", "name": "PetHack", "name_original": "PetHack", "description": "<p><strong>My first 7DRL submission!</strong> It was a fun week with a lot of learning.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Controls:\u00a0Arrow Keys to move/attack, 'S' to search.</strong></p>\n<p>This is an alpha release, and the game is under active development! <em>Certain systems are disabled due to bugs in the browser-only version of the game but hopefully will be fixed in the coming days (after 7DRL 2022 has ended).</em></p>\r\nYou are the pet\r\n<p>I love NetHack, and I especially love using pets, so I had a dream of a NetHack variant where YOU are the pet. You start as an innocent kitten, pony, or little dog, but can grow up to be whatever you want. There is a \"catch [th]em all\" aspect to unlocking new starting pet abilities -- will you be able to survive the hardcore \"grid bug\" mode?</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration, meet Reality...</strong></p>\n<p>In reality I only implemented the first dungeon level, full of grid bugs and a single pancake which you can't pick up because I had to disable my inventory system due to a bug in the WASM build. But, I\u00a0have built a pretty robust ECS that I\u00a0feel good about building on in the future, and these are bugs which I\u00a0will squash in the coming days after 7DRL has ended.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE follow me here\u00a0to receive updates as I\u00a0continue development.</strong> I\u00a0am excited to keep working on this project, and sharing code, learnings and new features with the community. The end goal of this is not to build <em>Yet Another NetHack Variant</em>, but to build an entirely new game that is worth playing on its own merits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I didn't accomplish that during 7DRL, so what did I\u00a0accomplish?</p>\r\nFeatures accomplished during 7DRL\r\n<ul><li>ECS running systems for Action, Behavior, Advancement, Combat, Health, Interaction, Inventory, PlayerInput, Rendering, Spawning and Visibility, and supporting a variety of composable components such as Brain, Vision, Equipment<ul><li>Note: several of these systems are disabled in the browser build and I haven't released the downloadable game yet (soon!)</li></ul></li><li>Randomized level\u00a0generation using BSP algorithm</li><li>Secret terrain such as doors</li><li>Message console</li><li>Field of view calculation for players and monsters</li><li>Character advancement a.k.a. Growing up</li><li>Combat, including different wieldable equipment (and monster attacks such as bites and claws)</li><li>WebAssembly build/package (although this has issues, see below)</li></ul>\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n<p>I need to fix many issues\u00a0but I wanted to submit this game because it's the first time I've ever been able to take the time off of work to do a 7DRL, and I\u00a0am proud that I was able to stick to it and upload something.</p>\r\nNo menu or help screen\r\n<p>The controls in the 7DRL submission are\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move/attack</li><li>S to search</li></ul>\r\nPerformance is slow\r\n<p>I apologize, I\u00a0am using Ebiten (Golang)\u00a0but building for WebAssembly and I\u00a0had no idea the performance in the browser would be so dramatically different.\u00a0</p>\r\nGame is incomplete\r\n<p>There isn't much to do yet. I\u00a0think a good 7DRL submission should at least be a finished game, and I acknowledge that\u00a0as of Sunday evening, this is more like a prototype.</p>\r\nCertain systems are disabled\r\n<p>I\u00a0had hoped this could be a browser game but Ebiten and WASM do not support certain basic golang libraries I was using and I\u00a0didn't have time to rewrite the code, so I\u00a0just disabled the systems that were failing. Most notably, the inventory (loot and equipment)\u00a0system is completely shut off in the current build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T06:24:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a21c0f21d3bb405cfce2c50ea4db17b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kilobaud"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
