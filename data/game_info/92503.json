Call Never Alone Hotline and enjoy our friendly hostesses.</em></p><p> Never Alone Hotline is my second game. It was made in less than 48h for the Ludum Dare #22 (theme \u00ab Alone \u00bb) and was quite a success since it ended 12th on 700, with a silver medal in \u00ab Theme \u00bb and a 4th position in \u00ab Humor \u00bb. In this game, you're a hotline hostess and you have to answer to every lonely caller. Only one ending, many path.</p><p>This is the remake, made a few years later.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff4/ff4a45c9e584aea17760cc3399d2f348.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Pierrec"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
