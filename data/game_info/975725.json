Parallel search, an automated process, can handle multiple targets simultaneously at a constant speed regardless of their numbers. Serial search requires the conscious intervention at a slower but more flexible speed. Through training, some serial search actions can be automated, reducing response time.<br/><br/>For the two different search methods, Drop Pane: Not Only Match-3 is designed with three gameplays: Match-3, Symmetrical Elimination, and Spell Elimination. Each of them consists of 19 levels in which the falling speed of the piece gradually increases. After completing level 9, you can unlock the optional Obstacle Block Mode, which randomly adds obstacle blocks to the playfield each time when you level up. Users can choose starting speed for levels 1 to 9 and starting height of obstacle blocks for levels 1 to 12, and unlock more obstacle block gameplay after completing the corresponding missions.<br/><br/>Color search exemplifies parallel processing. The match-3 mechanics, eliminating the blocks same color, tap into our intuitive understanding of color and enable the attention to concentrate on the arrangement of colored blocks. As a results, more pleasurable experience is obtained through continuous elimination.<br/><br/>Symmetric patterns gameplay requires to more conscious intervention. Symmetry is aligned with our aesthetic preferences, but identifying symmetrical targets is not an automatic process. Confirming symmetrical patterns' existence and guiding falling blocks to suitable positions require the storage and processing of substantial information in short-term memory. Successfully tackling this challenge demonstrates the competence in those professions demanding broad attentions, such as programming.<br/><br/>Beyond short-term memory usage, spell elimination gameplay involves extracting spelling information from long-term memory. Vocabulary, extraction speed, and attention span collectively influence on game performance, making it a gameplay style that demands on high intellectual comprehensive qualities.<br/><br/>The game's three modes form a progression from automated processing to complete conscious intervention. By continuous, incremental challenges completion, some serial processing tasks can be automated. As game performance improves, attention span and vocabulary extraction ability can be sustained and enhanced.<br/><br/>Please give your valuable comments on the game, I will always listen and improve the game, especially the spell elimination part. Since English is not my native language, it's hard for me to judge whether the difficulty is suitable for native users.
