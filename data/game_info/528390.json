In one state you can see/shoot enemies, and in the other state you can see/pick up ammo, weapons and health packs. The catch is that enemies can still damage you when you can't see them!</p>\n<p>I challenged myself to make and release a game in 4 weeks, and this is the end product of my work. It's a sci-fi\u00a0endless FPS game developed solo by me\u00a0(apart from the shotgun model which\u00a0one of my friends made for me).</p>\n<p>If you want to see my development journey, go check out my YouTube channel (https://bit.ly/sk-studios). If the video hits 50 likes I will keep developing the game further, so make sure to smash like and subscribe while you're there to support me!</p>\n<p>If I continue development, I'll add things like high scores, online leaderboards, and whatever the community has to suggest. If you have any suggestions chuck a comment on my video and I'll pick a few to implement!</p>\n<p>Just a quick note - If you are on Windows\u00a0I would recommend downloading the browser version can sometimes take a long time to load depending on your internet.</p>\n<p>Edit: Apparently the web version doesn't work for some reason, so I have removed it. Unfortunately this means that the game can only be played on Windows until I find someone with a Mac who is willing to let me build the game on their computer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T06:40:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/54951678e73c652a9da16e17cb2a6c58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SK Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
