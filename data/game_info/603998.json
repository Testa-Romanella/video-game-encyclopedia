The last outpost of civilisation on the edge of the badlands. One of the most relevant, cosmopolitan cities in the world. Is it any wonder you ended up here?<br/><br/><strong>cyberpunkdreams</strong> is an evolving text-based role-playing adventure with countless opportunities, and endless chances for destruction. Take on the role of a lone wanderer sent to the gates of 2090s Cincinnati. The dirt and grit from the badlands coats your clothes - with your memories torn from you, all you have is a weapon across your back and a mission to complete. <br/><br/>Enter a living, growing world, with new stories and other content each month, plus regular limited time events. You\u2019ll always find new surprises waiting for you in Cinci's dark and dirty alleys.<br/><br/>Who will you become in this cesspool of a city? Will you play the games and climb to the top, or be forgotten amongst the march of time and tyranny? <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Simple, uncompromising cyberpunk narrative</strong><br/>Enter a future grounded in reality: a world distorted by corporations and dominated by poverty. This is down to the bone cyberpunk, as raw as it gets. Experience just a turn of a corner away from our own, whether you're a genre expert or getting into cyberpunk for the first time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Learn who you are through your actions &amp; choices</strong><br/>Your abilities are intrinsically tied to your successes and failures. There are a multitude of ways to solve each problem you\u2019ll encounter -- what you choose impacts not only your chances of making it out alive, but also how your character grows and experiences the world. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Choices have consequences, and the city remembers</strong><br/>Your choices aren\u2019t detached from the lives of the people around you.
