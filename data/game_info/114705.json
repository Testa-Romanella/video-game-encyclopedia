Now you are - the Geometer. <br/> </p><p>As a Geometer, you have two spells - Inscribe, to place a node that is part of a magical shape, and Teleport, to shift about the field quickly. </p><p>SPELLCASTING TIPS</p><p>- Spell quality is based on shape accuracy and size</p><p>- The centre of the points is calculated, then the standard deviations of distance and angular separation are measured</p><p>- The larger the spell, the easier it will be to gauge where to put the next node, and the less effect errors will have</p><p>- If any of size, angle, or distance attributes are too poor, the spell will fail</p><p>- The view is isometric, but don't take this into account when casting spells</p><p>POSTJAM EDITION</p><p>- More spells have effects</p><p>- Changed graphics for Fissure<br/></p><p>- Added sound effects</p><p>- Enemies now attack</p><p>- Added menu with help and level customization <br/></p><p>Credits</p><p>Developed by Sean Gilhuly</p><p>Additional Credits</p><p>Tiles - http://opengameart.org/content/dawnblocker</p><p>Music - Digial Clouds - Eric Matyas (www.soundimage.org)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af2/af25aabb6c4c3c77604120b1a0cc7ab3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpareWizard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
