{"id": 629483, "slug": "hypercosmic-rebound", "name": "Hypercosmic Rebound", "name_original": "Hypercosmic Rebound", "description": "<p>Hypercosmic Rebound (HCR) is a manic arcade-style bullet hell space-shooter set in a flashy cyberpunk world. You play as Plutonia, a spunky runaway girl who needs to blast away hordes of robots and dodge swarms of bullets to escape her city.<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>(This game is currently in a sort of demo phase and only has 1 stage, but I plan to add more soon! Make sure to follow my Itch page if you want to know when I update the game!)</em></p>\n\n\n<em>Bounce Back!</em>\n<p>Utilize Plutonia's special <strong><em>Rebound maneuver\u00a0</em></strong>to ricochet\u00a0off enemy bullets with a satisfying bounce -\u00a0get bigger rebound chains to build up a power multiplier that increases your attack power and score!</p>\n\n<em>Figure out the perfect time and path to rebound, so you can maximize your destruction!<br/><br/></em>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<em>Adjustable Difficulty</em>\n<p>Never played a bullet hell before? Or perhaps you're a seasoned <em>shmup</em> veteran? HCR has you covered with a range of difficulty levels that change your life and continue counts.<em> Freeplay</em> mode allows you to play with infinite lives, so even newbies to enjoy the thrills of hardcore bullet hells. But if you're looking for a gauntlet, go for a deathless run in <em>Hell</em> mode!</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>Want an easy ride? Or perhaps something more spicy...?</em><br/><br/>\n\n<em>Controls and Guide</em>\n\n<ul><li><em><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> - Move around</em></li><li><em><strong>Z</strong> - Fire your weapons. Hold down for automatic fire.</em></li><li><em><strong>X</strong> - Spin.\u00a0Move while pressing to do a short invincible dash. Spin into a green bullet to begin a Rebound.</em>\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Stages of Rebounding:</strong><ul><li><em><strong>Parry</strong> - Spin into a green bullet and keep holding X to begin parrying it.</em></li><li><em><strong>Aim</strong> - While parrying, use the left and right arrow keys to move the red aiming arrow to point in the direction you want to be flung (remember to keep the spin button (X)\u00a0held down).</em></li><li><em><strong>Rebound</strong> - Release X to be flung in the direction you are aiming. You still have some degree of control with the arrow keys during this state.\u00a0</em></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>TIP</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>Rebound in the direction of other green bullets, then spin again to chain a consecutive rebound. The higher your Rebound combo, the bigger your attack/score multiplier at\u00a0the end of the chain.</em></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Cancelling rebounds:</strong><ul><li><em>Got no safe area to rebound into? Simply press the shoot button (Z) to cancel your Rebound. Your chain will end, and you can once again fly around freely.</em></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<em>You got somethin' to say?</em>\n<p>After you've played, please take the time to fill out this feedback form\u00a0to tell us how much you love or loathe HCR!
