{"id": 45356, "slug": "infliction", "name": "Infliction", "name_original": "Infliction", "description": "Infliction is a story driven first person psychological horror experience. Set in a regular suburban home, the story is told over alternating time periods spanning 13 years.<br/>Through environmental storytelling, Infliction tackles taboo subject matter. While you're discovering what has happened over the last 13 years, you're being stalked by an evil entity. Can you learn enough to vanquish the evil that lies within this family home or will you become a victim?Features<strong>Multilayered story</strong><br/>The story is not forced down your throat. You will decide how much you\u2019d like to learn via exploration. The story is told through memories, exposition, and environmental storytelling. Memories are delivered via audio after discovering something with a memory tied to it. Exposition is delivered via the radio, phone and television. The environment will also tell the story so the more you explore, the richer the story. Not everything is explicitly told to you but there are clues everywhere.<br/><br/><strong>Deeply interactive environment</strong><br/>You can pick up and examine anything that\u2019s not bolted down. You can read books with custom written short stories. You can turn on the TV and watch it. Listen to the radio. Look through the View Master toy and view slides. The list goes on. You won\u2019t be flipping tables and rearranging the furniture though.<br/><br/><strong>Fully dynamic lighting system</strong><br/>For the immersion and creepy feels. Lighting is not static, can be interacted with and used to your advantage.<br/><br/><strong>Multiple timelines</strong><br/>The story is told over multiple timelines. You\u2019ll get to experience the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s uniquely through the eyes of another family. The environment will reflect what was going on in that period.<br/><br/><strong>Dynamic AI</strong><br/>The AI\u2019s behaviour will change depending on where you are in the story. You\u2019ll never quite know what to expect. You won\u2019t be totally defenceless and can utilise strategy against your foe. That is, if they don\u2019t get the jump on you first.<br/><br/><strong>Professional voice acting</strong><br/>Professional voice actors were selected for their unique performances to enhance the games story and players experience.<br/><br/><strong>Professionally recorded sound effects</strong><br/>Sound plays a huge role in all games, more so in horror. For this reason we\u2019ve used a combination professionally recorded audio and custom sound effects to bring as much atmosphere as possible.<br/><br/><strong>Short TV show filmed just for the game</strong><br/>Because everything is interactive, content was needed for the TV. This low budget production also ties in to the story in a metaphorical way relating to what\u2019s going on in the game at that moment.Gameplay<ul><li>Objective based<br/></li><li>Bonus optional objectives <br/></li><li>Stealth/ strategize against AI<br/></li><li>Exploration to unfold story and meet objectives<br/></li><li>Intractable environment</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T01:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d46/d463ce713571994775d8f0c1bb244277.jpg", "website": "https://www.causticreality.com/infliction", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 58, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 56, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Caustic Reality"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Caustic Reality"], "esrb_rating": null}
