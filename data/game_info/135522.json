He definitely could use some help, so get your fingers ready and help him destroy as much microbes/viruses as possible!</p><p>We are really glad to have accomplished this in less than 48h, specially because it's the first game we have ever done! </p><p>Everything has been created for the occasion (except from the Arial Font).</p><p>Credits to this amazing people:</p><p>Victor Espada, IG: @victorespada_ : Animator &amp; Composer</p><p>Clara Nicol\u00e1s [placeHolder] : Chief programming</p><p>Julio San Rom\u00e1n, IG @julio_sroman : Concept Artist</p><p>Also you can follow me (I'm not amazing, tho):</p><p>Jos\u00e9 C\u00e9spedes: Game Designer</p><p>Please, enjoy our little project and feel free to tell us what can be done way better.</p><p>For now we are concerned of some bugs:</p><p> 1. No guide (we are creating it!)</p><p> 2. No 'way back' after having start (back button, where are you?)</p><p> 3. Changing Color of the Doctor is neither accurate nor helpful (the scores are well calculated, but we are working on it)</p><p>Our main goals are:</p><p> 1. Fix those bugs properly ASAP!</p><p> 2. Add some variatons, balance the whole game and provide a more complex experience!</p><p> 3. Highscores (local)</p><p> 4. Some new-brand levels (we already have the animations)</p><p>Other crazy ideas:</p><p> 1. Re-designing for phone-portability (top camera + corner buttons = endless fun :) )</p><p> 2. Adding more difficult mechanics (trying to keep it as simple as possible).</p><p>Please, do not forget to check out the music, it's kind of addictive (ok, I may be a fanboy)</p><p>Be happy! See you soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/502/5025f5fd140f6adce2e9a83af2185bcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jpoker98"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
