You will be given a few cards to remember.  Memorize what\u2019s on them and their location before being tested.  After a bit the cards will flip over and you will need to recall and find each card one by one.  Sounds simple enough but just wait until it gets more difficult.<br/><br/>As your streak gets higher you will have less time and more cards to remember.  Your brain will be pushed to the limits.  So get ready to give your full attention and concentrate.  With this brain enhancement tool you\u2019ll be able to feel your IQ going up.<br/><br/>The game is based on Miller\u2019s Law of 7 \u00b1 2.  That\u2019s the argued number of objects an average human can hold in working memory.  Test your memory to see what side of 7 you are on.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>49 Card Images<br/>Retina Quality Graphics<br/>Records Wins in a Row (Streak)<br/>Time Pressure", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T15:37:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ba/6ba58f631db300a6f71377f1125337c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lumate"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Lumate"], "esrb_rating": null}
