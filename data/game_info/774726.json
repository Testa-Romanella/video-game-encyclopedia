Build a factory from sorcery departments, fine-tune them to perfection, add a powerful steam engine \u2014 and you are at the forefront of the magical revolution.<br/><br/><br/>Now, what industry should we put out of business first with this new-found power? Dueling, you say? Easy! Ramp up the spell production, and let your sorceress fight Government Bureaus, Inventors' Guilds, and brawlers in the local taverns.<br/><br/><br/>See how world will react to your past, your big and small choices, a beautiful factory layout or a bad haircut. But don't forget to live your life: kick back in a chair near a fireplace, have a drink at the tavern, or redecorate your little company-issued home.<br/><br/><br/>It's the revolution, baby, and everyone got ideas \u2014 but *yours* are the best one yet. Explain the brilliance of market forces to starving peasants, convince the CEOs to unionize, or be \"above\" politics \u2014 every dumb and great idea is to be argued in the Nation of Debaters.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T04:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e03b8ad13e64e4c47449691c6a2f33a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["egor dorogov"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["egor dorogov"], "esrb_rating": null}
