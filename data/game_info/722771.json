You can use the system to track characters exploring the world at different times.<p>The game fits onto a 3x5-inch index card. Keep it next to your character sheet and place a marker on the time of day your character is present.</p><p>The front of the card is a leminscate graph depicting an hourglass with various times of day split by day and night.\u00a0On the reverse of the card is a short introduction to the card's rules and a poem.</p><p>You may use dice if you would prefer a random result. Roll any number of 1d6s and advance by the result.<br/></p><p>Being in different times of day will likely affect how the world appears to you. Narrate how things are different.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nAttributionThe idea of using a lemniscate graph to depict the phases of the day came from Doug McCune's blog. You can find the original article here.\r\n\r\nPlaying The Game\r\n<p>Use Watchkeep to track the progression of the day in collaborative roleplaying games.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n</p>\n<p>Choose a time to explore, or you can roll dice for a random result.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n</p>\n<p>Place markers along the path and take turns to discover the world. \r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n</p>\n<p>Narrate how the time of day changes your perception.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nExtending The System<br/>\n<p>Watchkeep\u00a0 is part of a series of tools designed to mechanise asynchronous narrative play - that is, one table's players and characters can be in different places or times.</p><p>Key &amp; Token provides additional context for creating scenes and playing keywords in a scene. It comes with a simple character sheet. Use Watchkeep to keep track of your Key &amp; Token characters' daily journeys.<br/></p><p>Marauder is a tool to create  point-crawl adventures and map networks of relationships. It doesn't  plot the actual, real-world position of a narrative focus, though you  can indicate things like distance.\r\n</p>\n<p>Marauder  uses the terms Vertices, Edges, and Weights. This terminology is  borrowed from Graph Theory, but generally, people would refer to these  as 'nodes'.\r\n</p>\n<p>A narrative focus can  be anything from a location, to a person or to an object. In play, you  move character tokens between points on the map and interact with them  through roleplay.\r\n</p><p>Myriad is a randomless narrative oracle system. Use it when playing GM-less, narrative games.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n<p>You are free to:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Share </strong>\u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Adapt </strong>- remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.<br/></p>\n<p>Under the following terms:</p>\n<p><strong>Attribution</strong> \u2014 You must give appropriate credit.
