It is a game about me losing patience and control as a result of my laptop's battery dying and a serious malware attack. However, I realised I could turn this into a real-life game so I did! To play Just, Why I have to manage the engineer and eliminate the virus that was floating on my screen, all I needed to do was use my index finger. BUT there's a catch: the game becomes difficult because my screen is inverted...\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first time, I'm using my own face, and computer vision makes use of it. I was first introduced to the module because I studied computer vision at my university. I was able to create my own game window, add animations, background images, and internal/external fonts, control the game's characters, and change the FPS value. Additionally, machine learning and image processing made significant advancements on Just, Why. For instance, to control my engineer character, I can utilise hand movements.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T12:45:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df8aa32c9a924d35428b676ed2232bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OnePersonStudio"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
