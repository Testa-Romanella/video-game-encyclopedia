In the first phase 5 rows fall down on the playing field one after the other. You can move the stones within the row to the left and right. Once the row is down, the next row falls and so on. After 5 rows the second phase begins. In this phase you can move all the stones up, down, left or right at the same time. This way you can close gaps, change the position of the stones and combine them. You can move the entire field 10 times.<br/><br/>If at least 3 stones of the same color are next to each other (it also counts around the corner), they explode in colorful effects. If there is a special stone right next to these exploding stones, it ignites and destroys even more stones, which can lead to breathtaking chain reactions.<br/><br/>Rowfall can be played in different game modes:<br/><ul><li>In endless play, you play until your stones reach the top. The falling speed of the rows increases from one phase to the next.<br/></li><li>The point attack means that you have to try to reach a given number of points as fast as possible.<br/></li><li>In the time attack mode you have only a limited amount of time to reach as many points as possible.</li></ul>.<br/>When you explode stones, a multiplier increases, increasing the points you score (each exploded stone gives one point). This multiplier is reset as soon as an action of yours does not produce a combination of stones and thus an explosion.<br/><br/>And now? What are you waiting for, show what you can do and enjoy Rowfall!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T04:03:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93bbcb5be0652a1707a8d8c28dbec83c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steven Guddat"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Steven Guddat"], "esrb_rating": null}
