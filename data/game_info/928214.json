Created for 2023's Global Game Jam.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I took inspiration from the folkloric Costa Rican legend of La Llorona, old silent films, and a nightmare I had the other day. <br/></p>\n<p>It aims to be creepy rather than terrifying, but still, play it at your own risk. A headset is very much recommended.</p>\n<p>If the game gave you something to talk about, consider donating. Any constructive feedback is greatly appreciated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T21:09:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebd/ebd54610acde829e580f2c0b27d970e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MRSinger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
