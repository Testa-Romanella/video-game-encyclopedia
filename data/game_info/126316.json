{"id": 126316, "slug": "bubble-recycle", "name": "Bubble Recycle", "name_original": "Bubble Recycle", "description": "<p>Game created in 60 hours for the GameJam <strong>Pot-au-Jeu</strong> organized by <strong>At0mium</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Name of the game :</strong> Bubble Recycle</p>\n<p><strong>Description :</strong> This game is full bugged. D:</p>\n<p>This is a game about recycling (old) items to get new ones. The idea is to progress in a dungeon under water (make your way to the abyss). You don't need to kill every monster to progress but it can helps you going faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Team (4 members):</strong></p>\n<p>Joel 'GCake' Huang(Developper), <br/>Mathieu 'Kynokaze' Rakoto(Developper), <br/>Axel De Nardi(Graphist), <br/>Chlo\u00e9 Horellou(Graphist)</p>\n<p><strong>Control :</strong></p>\n<p>ZQSD to move. <br/>Arrow keys to shoot. <br/>A to open/close inventory. <br/>E to interact.</p>\n<p><strong>What is missing :</strong></p>\n<p>- Every Sprites animation... :sob: (;__;)<br/>- Feedback from shoot/damage/etc.<br/>- Using object that we took in our inventory.<br/>- Some more sprites (that has been done by graphists but not implemented... sorry guys ;__;)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs :</strong></p>\n<p>- Some dead monsters will still inflict you damage if you touch them.<br/>- If you go through a gate and pass back really fast, the camera will maybe not be able to follow and will stay at the previous room instead of the current room you are in.<br/>- The inventory will sometime not show the items you have.<br/>- The inventory Recycle feature isn't working in the version we put here ;__; (it did works in a previous version though...)<br/>- Ennemies in other room will sometime get stuck on wall when you arrived or even waiting you in front of the door ! D:<br/>- When you die and restart, you will not respawn at the beginning but, instead, you will continue at where you died and with full life (this is op, lol)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Overall ?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, although all of these bugs and missing features, it was still a nice experience and we learnt a lot of things. Thank you At0mium for organizing this GameJam :)<br/> (Merci !)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sound Credits :</strong><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>ambient by strange day https://soundcloud.com/strange-day<br/>Creative Commons \u2014 Attribution 3.0 Unported\u2014 CC BY 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...<br/>Music provided by Music for Creators https://youtu.be/_CxScpf_Dds<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d5e105a9677e746f0b973eb8e19b838.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GCake"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
