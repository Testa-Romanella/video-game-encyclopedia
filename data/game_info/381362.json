This game focuses on more ambiguous story telling. You, the ghost have recently passed away, but something is keeping you from finding peace in the afterlife; Is it an insatiable anger from your time in the living world that keeps you? Or do you struggle with letting go of what you loved from the world to move on, keeping yourself chained in a lonely in-between.</p><p>\u00a0I wanted this little game to have more feelings in it than comedy, to make the player have just the briefest moment of contemplation of something that could be causing them anger or something that could be chaining them down that they can't seem to let go of. And on top of that, to show it is possible to quell that anger or break said chains. You'll have to find the kinks in the armor but nothing truly worth doing is done effortlessly, listen to those around you so you may find hints to proceed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/453/453048c15eec0270773162840c91c779.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bonk Boy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
