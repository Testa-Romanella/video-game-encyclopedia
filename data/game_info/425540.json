(<strong>@lordmaltazor</strong>)</p>\n<p>Feel free to add me on Discord as well :P (<strong>lordmaltazor#9021</strong>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE GAMEPLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>1. You start by blowing up the entrance to the bank with one of your c4 explosives.</p>\n\n\n<p>2. You will then have to take out a number of guards with a variety of guns such as assault rifles, pistols and sub-machine guns. The combat is very fast-paced and the time-to-kill is low, meaning that both you and your enemies deal alot of damage.</p>\n\n\n<p>3. After eliminating all the guards you will have to blow up the big vault doors with three c4s\u00a0to get access to the cash. The money that you collect in the mission can later be used to buy new weapons and gadgets to help you in future mission. However, if you die you lose all the money you collected in that mission and start over from the beginning.</p>\n\n\n<p>4. After stealing all the cash in the bank, you will have to return to your \"getaway-car\" in order to complete the mission. This is the same car that you spawn besides when starting a new mission.</p>\n\n\n<p>5. It's very important to complete the mission as fast as possible, after a certain amount of time has passed a police helicopter will appear outside the bank. It will then drop off cops that will run into the bank to hunt you down, and they will also start to spawn faster and faster.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>TIPS AND TRICKS:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>-Always aim at you enemies heads! It greatly increases damage if you land your shots.</p>\n<p>-Don't take to long when running through the bank, you don't have much time before the cops arrive!<br/></p>\n<p>-Vault doors requires three C4's to break, while wooden doors only need one.</p>\n<p>-Always aim down sights if you can, it greatly increase weapon accuracy.</p>\n<p>-You move a little bit faster when not holding a weapon, you can un-equip your gun with the Q key.</p>\n<p>-Play on Medium or Hard difficulty if you can, it gives you a cash multiplier once you've completed the mission.</p>\n<p>-You can view all the game's controls in the \"Controls\" tab in the pause menu (press escape).</p>\n\n<p>Infiltration also features a \"Performance-mode\" which disables certain effects and particles to reduce lag.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Please remember that some of the screenshots to the right might be a bit old and outdated as i constantly change and improve on the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cf3fd19e3dd1ed95388eb034e7843ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lordmaltazor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
