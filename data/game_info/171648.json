Nothing hard...</p>\n<p>But wait! Every one you kill, two new come! And there are like four types of them! So quick! Go and save this little village!!!\r\nSome zombies have just one health, some have two, some have houndred... Man, this is a lot of killin'.\r\nDon't forget to repair the village. You can do that using [space] and just a couple of coins. Or, you can slow legs of the zombies with [shift] so you can better click them. But there is a catch. They deal the same amount of damage. They will move slowly, but attack as fast as they can!</p>\n<p>We plan Linux and Android release, so prepare!</p>\n<p>Team:<br/>Pavel Marceluch - Programming, 3D design<br/>Mat\u011bj Vrba - Programming, audio<br/>Michal Voj\u00e1\u010dek - Consultant<br/>Ajn Kecav - Android port</p>\n<p>There are going to be several files:<br/>\r\nWin64 + 32 Original<br/>\r\nWin64 + 32 Updated<br/>\r\nLinux64 + 32 Original<br/>\r\nLinux64 + 32 Updated</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d12/d127250a05f03a6ceb6da3fd3f3e6432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KureKureciCZ"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
