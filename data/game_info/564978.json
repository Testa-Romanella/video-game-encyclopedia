That isn't the case here however. Things work differently in the simulation. Death is temporary, and in some cases necessary. Being crushed by a block or impaled in a pit of spikes will turn you into a ghost, allowing you to reach new heights and surpass obstacles. Don't get too used to it though as it only lasts 3 seconds before you're returned to your mortal shell.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Move Left/Right - Left &amp; Right Arrows<br/></p>\n<p>Jump - Z<br/></p>\n<p>Move Up (as ghost) - Z or Up Arrow<br/>\n</p><p>Move Down (as ghost) - Down Arrow</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nPLATFORMS\r\n<p>Windows 7 SP1\u00a0or higher</p>\r\nCREDITS<p>Main music loop - Electric Exodus v0.2 by FoxSynergy:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/electric-exodus\u00a0(slight modifications made to allow for looping)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:04:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b9/3b9db9259a9b43e0f5e01cecccb35518.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Watters"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
