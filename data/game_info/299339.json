Now, what you are here for:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hi, I'm Magnus IRL, or Icegold pretty much everywhere online.\u00a0This is my second published game ever, and it's published for the second BTP - Game Jam. Fun fact: My only other published game is called \"GlitchCube\" and\u00a0was made for the first BTP - Game Jam. Trust me when I say\u00a0\"I've improved\". But unlike the first Game Jam, I've actually used the entire week of this Game Jam, outside of school, which has made it hard to do anything in time. Well, if you'd like, you can check out GlitchCube here:\u00a0https://icegold03.itch.io/glitchcube.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, now to what we're all here for:</p>\n<p>PlanetHopper.</p>\n<p>PlanetHopper is a game about you, who find yourself stuck on a tiny planet. But as you'll soon find out, you have the ability to \"PlanetHop\", which basically means that you can teleport to any planet that is close enough to touch your \"Aiming Arrow\". Now your job is to complete the levels, and see what happens for yourself. But just a fair warning: Level 7, 12, 14 and the boss level are pretty hard, so hang in there, and if you just keep going at it, I'm sure you'll make it. Well, I guess I have nothing left to say besides: I hope you enjoy, and leave lots of helpful feedback, and constructive critisism about the game.</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Magnus 'Icegold' Toudahl</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T05:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c4/4c48cc5bc6a990e02067e8f844d4de35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Icegold03"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
