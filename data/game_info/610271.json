You won't have to do too much running, but you will break a sweat. Scattered around this forest are five cursed artifacts. They can be collected by you, and once you collect them, you can find the s\u00e9ance circle and banish the demon for good.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGameplay features:<br/>\r\nThe features to expect go as follows. Your character has basic walking/sprinting/jumping movement. You also have a stamina bar indicating how long you can sprint for, which regenerates over time. You spawn inside a forest, where five artifacts are hidden. You must look for the artifacts and collect them. There is a demon chasing you constantly, and it can kill you. Once you find all five artifacts, you must find the s\u00e9ance circle and interact with it to banish the demon and accomplish your mission.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGood luck, you'll need it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T05:58:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/080/080eb4203d50b5ac3a2f9ebd0674c380.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["vm.cabello", "1Wish Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["carolinemlhrs", "1Wish Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
