The story takes place in an ancient desert city called Mera. The city that used to be a pearl of the Orient, becomes the center of the slave trade under the Sultan\u2019s reign.<br/><br/>Explore with our hero every corner of this unique place and reveal life stories of the people who live there. Who knows? Maybe while strolling a dirty alley you will meet a great slave, maybe you will find the love of your life and maybe\u2026 maybe you will manage to save your own life.<br/><br/>Remember, you owe money to the Sultan himself and he doesn\u2019t forgive any debts.</p>\n<strong>Author\u2019s notes</strong>\n<p>The game is not focused on training and selling slaves! It concentrates more on life in the city. There is no time limit in the game. <br/><strong>Grinding</strong> \u2013 we hope we can find the right amount. Definitely the game is not constructed just on grinding.<br/><strong>Minigames</strong> \u2013 according to players\u2019 reactions we\u2019ll decide to keep them in the next update or not.</p>\n<strong>Gameplay</strong>\n<p><strong>3DCG interactive world</strong> \u2013 Explore 10+ locations via a City Map and interact with your surroundings.<br/><strong>Attractive character designs</strong> \u2013 Uniquely designed main and side characters.<br/><strong>Story-based game </strong>\u2013 Storytelling is an important part of the game. Do not expect sex scenes after a few minutes of playing.<br/><strong>Characters with personality</strong> \u2013 Each character has a unique personality. We don\u2019t create characters that don\u2019t have a brain (mostly).</p>\n<strong>Links</strong>\n<p><strong>Official website here!</strong><strong> </strong>(free downloads, news, info...)<br/><br/><strong>Join us on Discord!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Support on Patreon!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Support on SubscribeStar!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/8898b4382e085e07c36762069cc3e47b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Grumpy Eagle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
