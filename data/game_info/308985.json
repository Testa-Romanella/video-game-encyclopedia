The experiment resulted in a confusing yet somewhat coherent plot. I wrote the second to last scene (or technically the second scene?) which is about 1k words in length.</p>\n<p>I have decided to release an enhanced version of my scene as a stand-alone entitled\u00a0<strong><em>Reverse Robin: Second to Finale</em></strong> which has corrected typos, added sound affects, and includes a few new sentences at the end so it doesn't end so abruptly. The sub-title comes from the fact I was the writer that wrote the scene before a reveal in the\u00a0climax.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an important piece of my VN history, being the first collab I ever participated in, plus unfortunately the original\u00a0<em>Reverse Robin</em> is no longer available (DL is down)--but I'd like to have my scene still available for historical purposes.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T06:28:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a0/2a0cc3008d12665adae0e587cabdc336.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tofu Sheets Visual"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
