With her there\u2019s the <strong>fire demon Calcife</strong><strong>r</strong>, that Sophie uses as a weapon to defeat the enemies, so together they count as only one playable character.<br/>The <strong>main feature </strong>of the game are the <strong>golems </strong>that Sophie can animate with her magic. Every golem has its <strong>peculiar usage</strong> and a cost in resources in order to be used. So the player, while solving puzzles, needs to choose wisely which golem to choose in order to avoid wasting resources.<br/>Lastly,<strong> level boss fights</strong> are not actual encounters but more like <strong>dynamic puzzles</strong>: these enemies are immune to Sophie and Calcifer\u2019s attacks and the only way to defeat them is by <strong>using the brain</strong> and <strong>exploiting game elements</strong> present in their arenas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Starting from this game design, we fully designed the 10th level of the game,<strong> the \"Waste Disposal\u00a0Plant</strong>\" and developed a <strong>playable digital prototype</strong> to <strong>test the many different puzzle</strong><strong>s </strong>the players have to face during this level.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/><strong>Matteo Moriani </strong>- Game &amp; Level Design<br/><strong>Riccardo Lombardi </strong>-\u00a0Game Design,\u00a0Level Design\u00a0&amp; Programming<br/><strong>Marco Farina</strong> - Game &amp; Level\u00a0Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T04:30:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ab/9abea1e0d9d7f56915e023ffd6f71e2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LombRicc"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
