We decided to bring back that game and modernize it for today's maze playing fanatics!  </strong><br/><br/>This game teaches patience, balance and precise movement.  The game includes several maze levels which are progressively harder the higher level maze you play.<br/><br/>Your objective is to try to tilt the playing field up, down, left and right using arrow keys to guide the steel marble to the end of the maze without letting it fall into any of the holes. <br/><br/>The closer you get to the finish, the higher your score becomes.  The game allows for customizing the ball color, ball path, sound, and more.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T03:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23e/23ef0abe35c871352d8167403231fa8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["RAD Brothers Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["RAD Brothers Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
