It felt like something that wouldn't go amiss on the Gameboy Advance.</p>\n<p>Link two GBA's up, start your game, and give your father the other GBA. Use the B and A buttons to lower and raise your fishing poles.</p>\n<p>Sit together and have a chat whilst you wait for the catch, then reel them in.</p>\n<p>Current state: There's no music, or sound effects, fish aren't actually catchable, but you can play side by side on a GBA. Hopefully I can add the catching of the fish before the jam ends, but if not, consider this a loose tech demo :D<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Code by Mark Watkin</li><li>Additional libraries: libgba</li><li>Graphics by Mark Watkin</li><li>Music by ...</li><li>Sound FX by ...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T16:22:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/597e2cdf6d6f42cc32e6f44e6b4a13db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pmprog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
