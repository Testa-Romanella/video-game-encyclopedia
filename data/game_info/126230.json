With civilization dismantled by the sudden impact, people and pets are more distant. Maintain your friendship with man's best friend by giving him the materials and love you'd give in a normal life.<br/>-----------------------------<br/>Gameplay:<br/>Click or press any key to start, click the bottom left button to pause, click the one next to it to scavenge, click the icons on the right of the screen to spawn \"refreshments,\" rations, water, and soap, to refill hunger, thirst, and hygiene, and click on your pet to restore love.</p>\n<p>Keep the gauges up to avoid losing your pet. Soap needs at least one water to be used in exchange for hygiene having a slower cool down than the other stats. Love is the fastest stat to decrease at the benefit of being easily replenished. Hunger and Thirst share a more central rate.</p>\n<p>While scavenging, you may be robbed. Avoid\u00a0 being greedy and losing your materials by checking your materials and gauges between scavenges.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d03/d03597fc50d9610577672759235273bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["uhe_horse_extract"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
