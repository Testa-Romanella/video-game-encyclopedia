I read it to my six-year-old son at bedtime. \u00bbFox Tales\u00ab is his favourite story now. Learning to read and playing at the same time, that\u2019s what it is. We are looking forward to next stories.<br/><br/>\u2013 A wonderful story! I can recommend it to all parents. We read it together with my son in the morning and in the evening. Due to the subject matter, this particular story seems to be more popular with boys than girls. Giant spiders and snakes, fighting the muddy monster.

The protagonist is a girl named Amelia - she\u2019s exactly like our daughter.<br/><br/>\u2013 A great story to read and listen to! It is read with professional intonation.
