All you have are some highly inaccurate missile silos. The good news is that the enemy weapons are equally as flimsy.\u00a0The trick however, is that you can only build your silos in the explosion crators!<br/></p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Mouse to move and build.</p>\n\r\nTypes of silos:\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Microsilo</strong> -\u00a0Takes on crater to build. Easy to find a place for. Shoots a single rocket then self districts.</p>\n<p><strong>Macrosilo</strong> -\u00a0Takes 2 craters. Shoots slowly but is a lot harder for enemies to shoot down. Your most reliable weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Megasilo </strong>-\u00a0Takes 4 craters which are hard to come by. Shoots a lot faster, but is easier to hit for the enemy.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nHow does this game\u00a0fits the\u00a0topic?\r\n<p>As a first-time game-jammer my initial idea was way too ambitious to complete. The topic was \"Roll of the Dice\". I wanted to make an RTS where you have to look for dice-like dot patterns on the ground to build any building. 6 building types for each face of the D6 die. \r\nEventually the reality toned the concept down to a much more abstract interpretation of the dice. \r\nGood thing that the randomness is still there so at least we have that. =)<br/><br/>Please rate and be nice!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T16:20:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/110/1102c2d2186772106b4af27cc68f421a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stepan Drunks"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
