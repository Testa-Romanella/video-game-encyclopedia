Travel back to 2006 with a remake of the Picture Poker Minigame from New Super Mario Bros. DS!</p>\n<p>Find the devlog here!\u00a0My YouTube Channel</p>\n<p>I have since completely reworked all of the assets, including sounds, 3d models and animations to remove all things made by Nintendo so I can upload the game here.</p>\n<p>Please excuse any visual errors because of this, I had to change them all quite quickly!</p>\n<p>How to\u00a0play: It might be easier to go and watch some gameplay of the original (or you can watch the devlog for a brief explanation!)\u00a0Try and get the best hand you can, based on the rules in the top left, if you are confident in your hand, you can bet more than just one coin!<br/></p>\n<p>Submitted to the\u00a0Totally Ranked Holiday Jam - itch.io\u00a0as you start with (almost) no money, and have to earn as much as you can! Just realized I am an idiot I thought the theme vote was a tie at the top but I misread it, as such this game doesn't fit the theme at all. I must apologize for the mistake.</p>\n<p>The WebGL Build seems to have annoying light glitches, but this is only my second ever 3D game, so if anyone knows how to fix that please let me know :)</p>\n<p>Good luck, and Happy Game Jam Christmas\u00a0Everyone!<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>Try not to go down to one coin, because once you are, you can't get anymore! (maybe that was a secret feature...)</li></ul>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Princess Luigi Model:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/princesse-luigi-55ca932253b74a719074733045bd903b</p>\n<p>\"Humanoid robot\" by pinguinoconpulgares is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution. https://skfb.ly/KDMQ\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Kenny Animal Art Pack:\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/assets/animal-pack-redux</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://www.bensound.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bec/bec9bbe4f2697a690ca1a35cfa33d230.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BLANKdev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
