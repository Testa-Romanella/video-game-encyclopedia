Named after the logic gate, XOR will challenge you to think differently in a two dimensional arena.</p>\n<p>How to Play: Use the arrow keys to move, press P to pause, and press Ctrl to open the cmd prompt. You are the blue square, and must avoid getting hit by other squares. Every time the level bar fills up, you make it to the next level. Every level, you will be given less information, or a new enemy type will spawn. Beat level 10 to win the game.</p>\n<p>Created by Quantum Glitch Software</p>\n<p>Programming and Game Design: SuperQGS</p>\n<p>Art and Music: TekQGS<br/></p>\n<p>Reddit: r/qgsoftware</p>\n<p>Website: https://qgsoftware.net/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T04:06:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b79/b79d75163150603f1a92489cf2693245.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["QGsoftware"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
