Gold Edition is the enhanced edition of Guacamelee! that features all downloadable content for the original game and supports Steam Workshop to create and share custom character skins. In its core Guacamelee! is a 2D Metroidvania with platforming and brawling elements.<br />\nGuacamelee! is set in an open Mexico-stylized world, full of stereotypes and cultural references. You take on the role of an ordinary farmer named Juan Aguacate. Killed by an evil skeleton, you are brought back to life to save your love interest. The game follows the rules of the Metroidvania genre but has a twist: as you are revived, during your adventures you can switch between the land of the dead and the world of the living.<br />\nAside from that Guacamelee! is focused on exploration and hand-to-hand fights. While progressing through the story, you get new abilities such as movement upgrades and the necessity to match colors of your attacks and certain obstacles.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2013-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T07:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2eb/2eb8f1b4787c3beaa568bc52c0580cba.jpg", "website": "http://guacamelee.com", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 145, "owned": 2453, "beaten": 181, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 103, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 300, "suggestions_count": 385, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 302, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DrinkBox Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
