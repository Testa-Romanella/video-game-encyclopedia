The surest way to survive Father's Wrath is to escape underground to a world called Occultus. Information on the incoming storm and Occultus is encrypted, hidden and monitored. Use combos, special attacks and super moves to make your way to safety! The game is hard, but if you're getting destroyed, there's probably a move you're not using: getting stun locked? You can burst out, getting hit while switching? You have hard switching and burst swapping. Not hitting hard enough? You have weapon super moves.\u00a0Check out the training mode before giving up!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T08:34:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/915/91523365cf73643cf67532c845d0f26d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["carritohmc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
