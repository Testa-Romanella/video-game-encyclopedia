Not a single one ever managed to wound you so people started to think that you were invincible and your enemies started calling you H\u00e4gar the horrible. <br/>But then you died. (Probably Corona? Unfortunately, there were no vaccines.) One day you went to sleep, but when you woke up you were in a totally different place. Everything was dark, the only source of light was your old axe. It was lying right next to you, seemingly glowing from within . <br/></p>\n<p>   You look around and recognize the place, it is the old graveyard next to  your village. But it had never been so dark here before, it is not just  a dark night. There are no stars, no moon, no source of light at all.  Simply pure darkness surrounding you. Suddenly you hear a howling noise,  and two red flames appear in the darkness. But even though the fire is  bright you can't see a silouhette  or anything that is connected to the  flames. The flames are moving closer and closer towards your circle of  sight. The moment they reach it you realize it's the darkness itself,  trying to reach you and swallow you. A piece of darkness separates from  the blurred mass of shadows and crawls towards you with eyes of fire.  You grab your axe and swing it at the shadow beast. You can only gues  the direction but suddenly a crackling ball of lightning bursts out of  the tip of your axe, right into the shadows face. You are as suprised as  the shadow, which is thrown back into the void. As you look down on  your axe burning letters start to appear on the shaft:  \r\n            </p>\n<p><em><strong>\"A weapon given to the worthy to defend the weak ones!\u201c \r\n</strong></em><em><strong>Thor\r\n</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong> </strong></em>You hear a voice arising in your head: <em><strong><br/>\r\n\u201eYou have  proven yourself worthy! Welcome to Valhalla! Ragnar\u00f6k broke out, we no  longer need you to fight the mortal realms. Defend Valhalla by all  means. Take this weapon. You are the chosen champion of Asgard!\u201c \r\n</strong></em><em><strong><br/>Odin </strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to your axe which is now empowered to throw lightning you  find yourself holding a mighty spear in your left hand. You are the  only one who can save the world from sinking into chaos. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T23:11:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76fc1a0780a70c4e609f8895a06bf67a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GET A DRAGON"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
