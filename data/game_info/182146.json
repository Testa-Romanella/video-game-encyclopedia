So while Stop N Shred didn't turn out to be much of a game I certainly learned a lot while developing it. I gained some confidence in my art skills, I learned a lot about level generation as well as learning some much needed skills about creating UI stuff in Unity. I still think there might be something to that concept but I don't think I'm personally the right person to make it a reality. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cf4d6bb45fd3269243d8c4520223dba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["From Fire Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
