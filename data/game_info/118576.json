Your primary systems have come back online and you find yourself in a world much different from that which you knew before. Your memory banks are missing information related to your mission, and the functionality of several of your traversal systems is not working. Begin to piece together your memory and regain functionality of your subsystems as you explore this new and mysterious world.</p><p>To deal with the various types of terrain, MRBL-HD makes use of a spherical base attachment. Marblehead provides hybrid-platforming gameplay, which results in a truly unique experience; tackle traditional platforming challenges by controlling just the MRBL-HD unit, while the spherical base attachment allows for more momentum-based gameplay. As you explore the world you will discover more abilities that allow for interesting uses for both styles of platforming gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b2/2b2cdb49aa268b2c4a7b43738b50517f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["marblehead"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
