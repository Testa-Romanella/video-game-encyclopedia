You'll need to dunk yourself in water to fix that, but the water is always somewhere inconvenient. Like behind a wooden wall. What's that? You're already on fire? Well there's a solution to that wall, now isn't there?</p>\n<p>30 levels of puzzling, platforming challenge.</p>\n<p>This game was originally written for a competition to make a game in 4kb in Java. Which it won, beating a certain billionaire white-supremacist game developer in the process.</p>\n<p>It's worth about $2. But I'm setting the price to $100 instead. Better get it through the\u00a0Bundle For Racial Justice And Equality instead! That'd be a better idea on multiple accounts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T04:37:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e56/e56c9057c60a3713170a8fa618ec9312.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Noisy Owl"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
