As a digital artist that mainly creates interactive art &amp; glitch art, it's hard to be able to take my work to shows. With this project I can point people to an engaging experience rather than social media pages for my art.<br/><br/>It'll grow over time as I develop as an artist. I do plan to release on other platforms in a later release.\u00a0If you see anything that appears to be a bug please let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:59:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc3/fc300cb1678549cf4914e2fdd726249b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["btlgames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
