The central idea is to create an RPG, where to perform each action the player needs to answer a multiplication before. There is almost no balancing and a lot of bugs :)</p>\n<p>The final version will have another scenario and theme, but the same idea. One thing that has not been implemented yet, is the possibility of changing weapons, each with its own equations to solve.</p>\n<p>The goal is to release this game for Android. This prototype was made just to present the idea.</p>\n<p>So guys, what do you think? give us your opinion and ideas!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T12:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/100/100277734243c932f7c9762180dba7cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GabrielGalam"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
