{"id": 816192, "slug": "meet-her-there", "name": "Meet Her There", "name_original": "Meet Her There", "description": "Meet Her There is a short, intense, emotional time-loop, in which you're stuck reliving the same day over and over, trying to reach a person you love. It is an ultra-stylized visual novel, made entirely in 2 colors.<br/><br/>Originally a statement on time-loop narratives, it went on to become something a bit more ambitious, although it is still a very small-scale, intimate project.<h3>Made By: Sinisthesis</h3>Developed and published by me. Hi, I'm H_AK. I created the entirety of the story, assets and music in this game.<h3>Genre: Interactive Narrative, Visual Novel</h3>While I wouldn't call it a proper visual novel myself, it is built using a modified RenPy engine, so it should be a familiar gameplay experience to everyone who has experience with visual novels.<h3>Content Warning: suicidal themes, foul language. </h3>This is a very intense story with a very dark theme underneath, but I believe that these types of stories are important to explore. There's no graphic violence and I tried to approach the topics with an appropriate level of responsibility, but at the end of the day this is a pretty heavy game so I hope that you're approaching it knowing that its contents might be emotionally upsetting. It is also entirely a work of fiction, and any semblance to existing people, living or dead, is purely coincidental.<h3>Reviews:</h3>Meet Her There received some great responses from the people who have played its development builds so far. Here's a couple of quotes from the responses I've received:<br/><br/><br/><strong>- love the art, the sound design, and the dialogue was very well done</strong><br/><br/><strong>- short but pretty compelling. The visual style perfectly suited the dark subject matter</strong><br/><br/><strong>- great writing and story telling</strong><br/><br/><br/>I hope that you like it as well.<br/>Cheers, H_AK.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T02:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da2/da231cf20bd4b610cec5aa760c5e529c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["H_AK", "Sinisthesis"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sinisthesis"], "esrb_rating": null}
