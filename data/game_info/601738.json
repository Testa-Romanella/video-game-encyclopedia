The theme of the jam was \"Out of bounds\" and so I made \"Out of bounce\". In this game you play as a rubber ball that wants to get to the flag of each level. But it can only move by jumping and every jump it does gets smaller and smaller. Controlls: choose direction with directional buttons or a and d. jump with space, directional button up or w.\u00a0Note:\u00a0This\u00a0game\u00a0might\u00a0not\u00a0work\u00a0on\u00a0WIndows because\u00a0I couldn't\u00a0test\u00a0it\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0windows\u00a0computer.\u00a0If\u00a0it\u00a0doesn't\u00a0work\u00a0please\u00a0write\u00a0it\u00a0in\u00a0the comments of this game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:46:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cc/5cc7ce83f310420af132177cfdbe23e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Karljakob"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
