You can now weaponize your produce, whatever you eat, you will be able to make cannons of it and show those monsters who\u2019s boss.</p>\n<p>For each level you will be able to view the incoming monsters in advance, and will have to put together a plate of assorted foods, all of them with different stats. You will devour them and charge into the oncoming waves of monsters. Beware, all foods have different uses, one might seem too expensive, but what the use of stashing up on bananas if they cannot damage the monsters fast enough.</p>\n<p>Some basic information to get you started:</p>\n<p>The atrributes on the fruits are Shooter, Piercing and Defence.</p>\n<p>Shooter - As the name suggests, once placed, the cannon will start shooting out the fruit and damaging the incoming enemies.</p>\n<p>Piercing - Shooting category fruits will only be able to damage the enemy that is at the front, where as Piercing fruits will damage the enemy across the entire lane.</p>\n<p>Defence - These fruits serve the purpose of stalling the enemy, they can be placed down as a sort of damage absorber, as a tank so to say.</p>\n\n<p>You might be tempted to take all bananas, but know this, the banana cannons might be efficient, but they take too long to kill the enemy.
