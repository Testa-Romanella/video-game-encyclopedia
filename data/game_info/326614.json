If moved, flames would appear from beneath them, &amp; misfortune would occur until they were repaired. Even now a strange light may be seen on some nights there. A way to the otherworld, perhaps? Maybe UFOs? ... Maybe this Bitsy tale will help you piece together the strange goings on.</p>\n<p>This Bitsy collaboration was created at Feral Vector 2019 as a paper jam, with each contributor creating 8x8 characters &amp; dialog, which they\u00a0added to a paper map of the area around Stoodley Pike. It was then turned into this Bitsy.</p>\n<p><strong>To Play</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use arrow keys to move &amp; interact with objects.</li><li>Bump into an object &amp; discover the story.</li><li>You can't walk through houses, rivers or tree-tops.</li><li>You can pass in front of tree-trunks.</li><li>There is no ending! :-O</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Collaborators include</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Athena Paradigm</li><li>Duckling Smith</li><li>Emma Daues</li><li>Em Lindqvist</li><li>Freya C</li><li>Natrix</li><li>Onion</li><li>Ren Binden</li><li>SG</li><li>Stella</li><li>Tom</li><li>AshG</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks to all those who got involved. :-)<br/></p>\n<p>If you contributed, &amp; your name isn't on the list please let me know &amp; I will add it &amp; a link to your online profile page.</p>\n<p>And thanks to the people behind\u00a0Feral Vector for organising such a fun event.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks also to Hebden Bridge Local History Society for the background information\u00a0 about the standing stones.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T04:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d2b2e30c85634e2aa26422d727d48bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AshG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
