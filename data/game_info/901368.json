You loose when the it fall down out of the screen.</p>\r\nProject genesis:\r\n<p>Throughout the year, I made shooters, a pacman, run and jump games, but not fighting ones. I wanted to make a fighting game, or at least start learning to make them. I tried to do one last month in a game jam, I wanted to make a Street Fighter clone, it ended up too much work for me, so I simplified the gameplay to a projectile exchange. \u00a0</p>\n<p>I thought I would finally make it in this jam, but I've not mastered Raylib enought for that, so I've made a kind of workaround, there is a ninja hitting a box/button in order to make a ship go up and keep going up. The fight mechanic serves here to hit a button.</p>\r\nLanguage : C\r\nFramework : Raylib\r\nCode :\u00a0senor16\r\nMusic : Kneezuz\r\nGraphics :\r\n<ul><li>Character : Free ninja sprites - Kunoichi - https://Craftpix.net</li><li>Background : Screaming Brain Studios</li></ul>\r\nDevelopment duration : 16h", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T13:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4c/e4c0dd92b83f46ec249d9e3e2e153d1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sesso Kosga"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
