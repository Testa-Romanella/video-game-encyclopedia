That game was styled after the Atari game <em>Bobby Is Going Home</em>, and\u00a0followed the adventures of Lamarr, a pet alien headcrab from HL2 who gets teleported far away from her home at the start of the game but has somehow made her way back again some time later with no explanation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>LIGH was made in Flash, so it might not still be playable in a browser at the time of you reading this. But you can always enjoy this \"let's play\"\u00a0video of it:\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Let's Play Lamarr Is Going Home!</em><br/></p>\n<p>While LIGH shed some headcanonical light on\u00a0Lamarr's journey home again, LIGH2 was to serve as an explanation for how Lamarr might survive and return home after being accidentally shot into space and blown up in an interdimensional portal explosion as seen in <em>Half-Life Episode 2</em>, the assumption being that she would be once more inexplicably alive and well in <em>Episode 3</em>.\u00a0(I devised a detailed fan-theory that totally explains it using only in-universe material, I\u00a0swear!)\u00a0\u00a0Unlike its predecessor, LIGH2 was to be more about retro platformer-style exploration\u00a0than imitating the narrower scope &amp; style of\u00a0<em>Bobby Is Going Home</em>.</p>\n<p>Due to restrictions on the free version of Construct 2, I only had room to make this one simple level, but demonstrating platforming, parallax, and story events made for a good proof of concept that I could use to possibly crowdfund myself a full version of Construct 2 with the primary purpose of making more levels, although I did explore other game-making options and quickly lost interest in Construct.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, now that I've remembered this demo exists, I want to release it to\u00a0share my fun little diversion from 4 years ago that almost nobody else has seen until now. If there's still interest in Half-Life fan games like this then\u00a0I may consider taking another swing at it, but until then,\u00a0I don't have any current plans to do so.<br/></p>\n<p>-AK.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:19:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59d/59dff8ed8681d63be65bdba64961d84c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AK"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
