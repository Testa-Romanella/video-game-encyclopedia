Building lets you mold your creature's body, and attach different body parts to it, while painting lets you change the color and pattern of your creature\u2019s skin! Because of the limited amount of time I had due to university, I was not able to implement the testing section, however this will definitely be added in a later update!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How it was made:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>General -\u00a0</strong>Hold and drag your mouse anywhere in the environment to rotate the camera around your creature and scroll to zoom in and out!
