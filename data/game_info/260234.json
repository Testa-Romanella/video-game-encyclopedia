In cricket darts, two players compete to be the first to close the numbers from 20 to 10, and the Double, Triple and Bull (DTB). After scoring three hits on a number or DTB, the player opens that number or DTB for additional score until the other player closes it by also hitting it three times. The first player to close all numbers and DTB, and have the higher score, wins! It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>The game provides a timer for additional information purposes only, as well as a count of how many turns have been taken by each player. The entire game can then be uploaded to your personal iCloud account, with a full description of the game, including when and where it took place, and the number of turns, misses and time taken by each player.<br/><br/>You can add player names (which will then be included in the description above), and you can undo as many moves as you want (in case of errors).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:59:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c47/c47daef596796cf14063257946e289dd.jpg", "website": "http://frasco.co.za/software-development/ios-apps/cricket/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Joao Frasco"], "genres": ["Sports", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Joao Frasco"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
