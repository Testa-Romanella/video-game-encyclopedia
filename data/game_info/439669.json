Moving around takes a while. It's also hard to get some sleep because humans relentlessly scale you. Wouldn't it be nice if they took a tiny tumble down a steep slope? As it turns out, a brief shake is all it takes to have those climbers lose their footing. But will crippling their compatriots be enough to discourage them?<br/></p>\r\nControls (DPAD)\r\n<ul><li>LEFT/RIGHT: Target a side.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>DOWN: Shake targeted side.</li></ul>\r\nReflections\r\n<p>This is the first game I've made on PICO-8 so constructive criticism is very welcome. I couldn't have done this without my artist/idea-person/sister Humanic.</p>\n<p>I submitted this to the Dream Arcade Archive jam but it was adapted from my unfinished concept for Mini Jam 53, the theme of which was, you guessed it: <em>Summit</em> . It could be more arcadey but I wanted to move on to my next game thing. I'm not opposed to revising but I want to stumble through a few more projects first.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and playing! Hope you were able to feel some positive emotions from this experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:16:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77a/77a80204b3552a15b8373662567b2aad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ampersands"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
