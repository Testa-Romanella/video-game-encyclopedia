This game is a mix of a golf simulation and an action adventure. If you like ragdolls, then you will have some fun with the procedural animation as well.<br/></p>\n<p>It is a VR\u00a0 game so you will need a HTC Vive in order to play it.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to defeat the 3 crystal giants. This will deactivate the barrier around the Boss (this big spiky thing on top of the mountain).\u00a0 You have 30 hits to do so, otherwise you and the whole island will be crushed by the huge meteorite.<br/></p>\n<p>A giant is slain, if you can manage to hit its backside once. Its frontside is protected by a crystal layer, which you can also destroy.</p>\n<p>Have fun :)<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:02:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da1/da11413ad1f72875900277b3640835f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JoJue"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
