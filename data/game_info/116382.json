Perfect!</strong><br/></p><p>The best game you've ever played in the last four of five minutes. But really it's kind of awful. Made for Global Game Jam 2017, based on the theme \"Waves\". Yeah, we really stretched our imagination skills here.</p><p>Four starving players duke it out on a rickety raft, fighting for food dropped by seagulls, god, and an anonymous benefactor your water craft is trailing. The last one alive wins, and becomes the captain.
