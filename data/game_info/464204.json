However - you're controlling him remotely, and his software isn't very up to date! You have a limited amount of movements to use, and all inputs are delayed. Press left, and he won't move. Press up, and he'll start moving left. Press right, and he'll start moving up.\u00a0</p><p>This game was made by me, LFOB, and doots. We had a lot of fun making it - but the time crunch was very real since this jam is so short! We only managed to get a few levels in by the end, but hopefully you will find them fun anyway! If we aren't too exhausted, we will hopefully add a bit more content and polish to the game. Sorry if there are any bugs, I will try to fix them as they come up but\u00a0levels weren't even loading until the literal final hour so I hope you can understand the kind of pressure we were under LOL</p>\n<p>Programming: Kimera Royal (me)<br/>Art: Kimera &amp; LFOB<br/>Music: doots<br/>Additional Voices: Fantabuloso (Sam\u00a0McCallum)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:23:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/963/9633f94aa8a00668082c076995f6a096.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KIM ROYAL"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
