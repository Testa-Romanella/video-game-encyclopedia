Original version: Mark Wirt - Commodore Business Machines (UK) Ltd. - Commodore 16/Plus4,\u00a01984. Created with GB-Studio 2.0.0 beta5!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You are a lone XZAPPER, last survivor of an advanced civilisation.Many centuries ago, your planet was besieged by alien hordes. Now only you remain. The aliens have the advantage of numbers, but you are on home territory.\u00a0Your mission is to collect energy berries left on the tracks and complete all 12 levels.</p>\n<p>The game was probably never released independently, only as part of a collection that came with the Commodore 16. The gameboy version does not follow the original game where you have to shoot. In this version you have to collect points, but the graphics solutions are very similar.</p>\n<p>Since there was no original box art for the game, I made it based on a similar design as the Commodore company at the time (I hope).\r\n</p>\n<p>Also available for download in .CIA format for the Nintendo 3DS virtual console!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong>A<br/><strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Cursor keys<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Start the game:</strong>\u00a0Z\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Arrow keys<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Xzap - Commodore (UK)\r\n</p>\n<p>Creator (WLS) homepage link:\u00a0https://www.wls.hu/xzap-gbc\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T11:57:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7b/f7bf358c383992badb7f640a065c37f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rajcs\u00e1nyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
