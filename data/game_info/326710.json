With the recent success of <em><strong>DERE EVIL .EXE</strong></em> and the upcoming release of\u00a0<em><strong>DERE VENGEANCE</strong></em>, we decided to upload the prototype NES ROM for AppSir fans to enjoy.</p>\n<p>The creation of the PROTO DERE .NES prototype game led to AppSir's modern day hits<strong><em> </em><em>DERE .EXE</em> </strong>and DERE EVIL .EXE. For 33 years, the cartridge could not be found.<br/><br/>Recently, an FB user was able to track down the original cart for the unfinished NES game \u2018PROTO DERE .NES\u2019 and dump the ROM online. He posted this in the Obscure NES Games Group:<br/><br/><em>\u201cGuys, I think I found something! Apparently, it\u2019s a lost NES port of the old PROTO DERE arcade game which was showcased in 2017 for the AppSir launch party. I couldn\u2019t find information about the game in any of the listings. It\u2019s either an obsure bootleg, or a pre-production cart that never made it to release. Despite the internal damage on the game\u2019s circuit board, I was able to rip the ROM so you guys can have a look at it. It\u2019s filled with glitches, but I\u2019m certain I didn\u2019t corrupt the ROM. That\u2019s how it played when I got it working on my dusty old NES, so maybe that\u2019s why it was never released.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Other users expressed their excitement for the game\u2019s discovery with some inquiring about the possibility of buying the physical cartridge. Some users have even claimed to have played the unreleased NES game before and have started sharing their nostalgic experiences. However, the group has now been archived as some of its users have been found dead.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, for fans of the series, it is now possible to play PROTO DERE .NES on your home computer by using an emulator such as <strong>FCEUX</strong>!</p>\n\n\n<p>Please enjoy this short platformer game prototype!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2c/e2cd3a281eec88d041a5992465099ff3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AppSir"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
