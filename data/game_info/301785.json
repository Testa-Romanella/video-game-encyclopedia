Because the app is slightly buggy, I'm uploading all of the messages you can go through between the characters. This is a conversation you could have with Vulcan.</p>\n<p>For this project, I used characters and quotes from the American Gods franchise but also took creative freedom with some of their messages.</p>\n<p>This is in not associated with American Gods or Neil Gaiman in any way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:04:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad0/ad04d342e386140e2fd08dd8b0560533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aubrey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
