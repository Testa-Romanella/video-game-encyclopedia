I've taken a few hacks at building a visual novel in the past, but this is the closest I've ever gotten to having a full complete visual novel. I've been trying to complete more projects, and so, while this is EXTREMELY short, I wanted to push myself to get it to a finished state.</p>\n<p>I spent a lot of time on the menu and audio system, and I'm very proud with how they turned out. A lot of my work went into changing the open source dialogue runner to work with my project. I managed to set up a pretty smooth workflow, and for that reason alone, this project was a huge success.</p>\n<p>My dream is to use this visual novel framework around a more typical game. I have some ideas, and while I've made attempts in the past, I think this will give me a much better starting point.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you encounter any bugs (besides the characters), or just general features you feel a visual novel should have.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T09:52:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d84c196d37874fbb57d80e4d1d0df67d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["LemonProphet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
