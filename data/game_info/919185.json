The piece movement and objectives are shown below.</p>\n\n<p>(in order of bottom to top, left to right, skipping duplicates)</p>\n<p>Guard - Moves like a combination of a knight and bishop, in an L shape (two spaces in one direction, one space in an adjacent one), or diagonally until it hits an edge, takes a piece, or is blocked by a piece.</p>\n<p>Prince - Moves like a king, but only orthogonally.</p>\n<p>King - Moves one space in any direction (same as normal chess)</p>\n<p>Queen - Moves in any direction until it hits an edge, takes a piece, or is blocked by a piece (same as normal chess)</p>\n<p>Princess - Moves like a king, but only diagonally</p>\n<p>Wall - Moves to any open space on the board, only takes one space directly in front of it (ie. up for white, down for black), can only take and be taken by other walls. (Serves as a barrier for other pieces)</p>\n<p>Bronze - Moves like a king, but can be moved by both players.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Checks and Mates - There is no check until the king or queen have been taken (it can be ignored) but once one of them have been taken, you must move out of/block checks when possible. If you are in check, but have no legal moves (that get you out of check) then you are checkmated, and you lose. If you are not in check, but don't have any legal moves, you are stalemated (can happen before a king/queen have been captured), and the game is drawed.</p>\n\n<p>Winning the game - There are three ways to win the Game of Bronze, either take the bronze on your turn, use the bronze to take your opponents prince and princess, or kill the king/queen and checkmate the other (described above).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T16:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/759dc5e3c30b6c67cbd08a84afdc41b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ninju4821"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
