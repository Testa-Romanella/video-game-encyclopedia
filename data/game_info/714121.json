{"id": 714121, "slug": "relic-space", "name": "Relic Space (itch)", "name_original": "Relic Space (itch)", "description": "<p><em>RELIC SPACE is a turn-based, roguelike RPG set in space. Playing as a single elite starship pilot, experience hardcore, tactical ship-to-ship combat in a highly replayable, procedurally generated sci-fi galaxy, while uncovering an epic, space-opera storyline.</em></p>\n\r\nTactical turn-based space combat\r\n<p>Use your tactical skills on a hex grid with fast-paced \u2018one-tile-per-turn\u2019 mechanics inspired by traditional roguelikes, but with a fluid, modern feel.<br/></p>\r\nDeep Simulation\r\n<p>Manage your ship's heat, energy, and other resources, while\u00a0realistic combat mechanics simulate damage to the individual components on your ship. Each weapon, engine or utility item can catch fire, leak power, and acquire many more status effects.</p>\n\r\nNon-linear exploration\r\n<p>Freely traverse a procedurally generated solar system with handcrafted elements. Factions and NPCs pursue research, trade, construction projects, and other goals irrespective of your actions \u2013 though your actions affect their success or failure!</p>\r\nFlexible development\r\n<p>Use your growing reputation and influence to acquire more powerful ships and equip them with countless weapon and utility combinations. Acquire new piloting abilities through a flexible skill tree, and research relics to unlock new powers and equipment.</p>\n\r\nImmersive setting\r\n<p>Uncover a rich, branching narrative threaded with endless procedurally generated stories in a detailed setting inspired by hard sci-fi.</p>\r\nReal Space\r\n<p>Movement rules based on actual space physics: motion in a straight line is free, but turning, starting or stopping cost energy.</p>\n<em>A Roguelike RPG</em>\n<p><em>As used here, a roguelike RPG is a game that has many of the usual features of RPGs, such as character progression and a detailed fictional setting, but also has a lot of procedurally generated content. This makes such games highly replayable, since they are different each time you start a new game, but it does mean the storytelling may be different from what you\u2019d expect in a non-roguelike RPG.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>In Relic Space many missions and dialog elements, for example, are randomly generated \u2013 though there is also a handcrafted main storyline similar to what you\u2019d find in other RPGs. Also, as in the original game \u2018Rogue\u2019, in Relic Space you control only a single character (starship), rather than a whole \u2018party\u2019 (fleet). This focus allows for a deeper and more complex simulation of your individual starship that can still feel fast-paced and fluid.</em></p>\r\nDownload the Free Demo\r\n<p>A free Demo\u00a0version of the game is available to download from this page.
