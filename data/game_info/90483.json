Travel into the frozen woods in a folktale from the world of Night In The Woods.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt was made by Alec Holowka, Scott Benson, and Bethany Hockenberry in the last weeks of 2014.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a supplemental game, which is to say it's not a demo or a preview of Night In The Woods. In some ways Lost Constellation is a lot like NITW, but in a lot of ways it's not. It's a tangent, a side-story, a way for us to explore a bit in a more off-the-cuff manner.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe hope you love it!\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Soundtrack</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-20T01:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4f0adeea43f6ae2266c8fcbe3bd13c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Finji", "bombsfall", "InfiniteAmmo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
