Locks and keys, buttons, portals, slingshots, and so much more.\u00a0</li><li>Elemental Explosions. Join elements together for greater effects!</li><li>Many more enemies, and much more in-depth combat!</li><li>\"Endless Mode\": Fight against ever-increasing waves of enemies, and hold out for as long as you can!</li><li>\"Adventure Mode\": The classic Zelda experience! Explore the dungeon, solve puzzles, unlock new abilities, and fight through enemies on your way to the final boss.\u00a0</li><li>Character select! Each character uses their tether differently. Fling yourself across the room, swing enemies around like a wrecking ball, or send things flying with anti-gravity.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f34ac528ee2b25c28b89984038362ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RohirrimRowan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
