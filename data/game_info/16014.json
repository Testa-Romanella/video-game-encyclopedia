{"id": 16014, "slug": "planetary-annihilation", "name": "Planetary Annihilation", "name_original": "Planetary Annihilation", "description": "<p>Set in the distant future, this science fiction strategy was inspired by Total Annihilation (1997) and is designed by one of the original game&#39;s engine creators, Jon Mavor. Planetary Annihilation gameplay is largely similar to classic RTS series like Starcraft or Command &amp; Conquer, yet not without its own unique features. This game is focused on interplanetary wars on a larger scale and allows its players to conquer the whole worlds or even destroy them using nukes and Death Star-like devices. The maps are randomly generated, and each map constitutes a whole planet in 3D projection (albeit scaled down). Each player starts with a Commander unit that is used to create necessary buildings. Commanders represent the player and, like in chess, loss of your Commander means losing the game.</p>\n<p>The definitive feature of the game is that battles are not contained to certain planets, but are fought across the whole planetary systems using missiles and &quot;planet thrusters&quot;; and there are many such systems in the galaxy. The scale of the setting can make it difficult to keep track of one&#39;s operations across different systems at the later stages of the game.</p>", "metacritic": 62, "released": "2014-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:54:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20e/20ec6440ede691638c42684fd6551156.jpg", "website": "http://www.planetaryannihilation.com", "rating": 2.87, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 125, "owned": 2291, "beaten": 35, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 101, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 173, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 173, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Uber Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Uber Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
