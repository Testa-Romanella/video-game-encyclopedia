The theme is \"Don't drop it!\" Because of the limited\u00a0amount of time, there is no partner monkey AI, so having a second player is pretty doggone necessary to\u00a0play this game. Perhaps these monkeys will see some updates in the near future! Maybe a single player\u00a0mode, 4-players, a versus/battle mode, or even online multiplayer if I'm feeling ambitious! Who knows?? Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>*From the time I opened GameMaker Studio to the point of having the fully functioning game is what took almost 3 hours exactly. Before those 3 hours, I spent hours planning, writing some pseudocode, downloading sound effects and music, and creating the monkey sprites and beach background. After the 3 hours of development, I added the start screen and game over screen and also added the music and sound effects. I also did some final touch ups. By most others' criteria, I'd say I spent more like 5 to 6 hours developing the game. I hope to try another Trijam to actually only spend 3 hours developing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T02:41:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c77/c7719fa764b41306a088e0ab12a785e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aptBenj"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
