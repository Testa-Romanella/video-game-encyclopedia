You play as an advanced robot tasked with sabotaging the operations of Good Machines Inc, a lunar mining giant.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Details:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Move, jump and dash your way through various platforming puzzles.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Defend yourself against enemy robots with ranged and melee combat.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Upgrade tools by mining minerals and selling them for cash.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Explore the large mining site above and below ground.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The gun does not work at point blank range.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a specific part\u00a0where the game sometimes crashes. There is an autosave checkpoint before, so the save should not be affected too much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The camera collision is very unstable. In small areas it will freak-out and also phase through walls from time to time.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The falling system on some areas conflicts with the ragdoll physics. If you get stuck, reload your last save.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The combat/enemy spawn system and AI movement\u00a0is constantly being tweaked and balanced.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The UI is a work in progress. I am currently working to add more settings and better descriptions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>This is a demo of a game I have been working on for a couple of years.
