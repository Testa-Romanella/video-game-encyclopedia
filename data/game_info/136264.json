{"id": 136264, "slug": "illume", "name": "illume", "name_original": "illume", "description": "<p>Originally created for National Game Development Month 2012 -- a month long game jam held in June; since renamed Worldwide Game Development Month -- illume was first released in a broken and incomplete state. The game was fully reprogrammed as part of Worldwide Game Development Month 2013 and may now be experienced as originally intended. The game itself may be completed in under 5 minutes and is intentionally simple, though it does provide a basic level of challenge; however, the focus is entirely on the short story experience the game wishes to convey. The audio is an important part of that experience, so it is highly encouraged that you play with sound on and without any distractions or interruptions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c20/c20077061d16c92081e03e3df0100fb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pete Vellucci Jr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
