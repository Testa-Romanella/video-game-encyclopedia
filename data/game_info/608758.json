SUV Racing. Diesel swaps. Crawlers. 4wd. Free. And much more!  Why haven't you started downloading the offroad game yet?<br/><br/>Offroad Sim 2021: Mud &amp; Trucks will give you everything you want from four wheeler games: challenging levels that challenge your truck driving skills, a huge selection of unique 4x4 SUVs and 8x8 trucks. But you won't find car parking, it's too boring for realistic games!<br/>Choose your SUV and go on a journey! Complete offroad outlaws awaits you! Test your driving skills in dirt track racing games against opponents. To win races and driving games you need to improve your car! Fit new tires and wheels, suspension, increase engine power, or upgrade your transmission. The improved car will be able to climb high mountains and hills. Reduced transmission off road is important for four-wheelers, but even more important are the huge wheels! And we have them and are waiting for you!<br/><br/>No matter what car you choose - a powerful SUV, a slow truck and a fast buggy, you can always enjoy the 4x4 mania and gigabit offroad!<br/>But our vehicle simulation game has a downside, you need to monitor the durability of your car or truck, because if you do a lot of damage or crash, you will not be able to continue exciting races and you will have to start them all over again!<br/>As with all highly rated games and physics games in our game, you will be able to enjoy the elaborate physics of the car. Whether you are climbing stones, transporting cargo in a trailer or participating in a mudfest, you can always be sure that the SUV responds adequately to the road. The main thing is not to get stuck in the mud!<br/><br/>We really hope you enjoy our off road game with mud!<br/><br/>Note: VIP Membership subscription price is $4.99 after 3-day free trial which unlocks exclusive cars, removes forced ads, unlocks all game modes and vehicle classes.
