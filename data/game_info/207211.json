I thought it would be fun to have a \"Plane Jam\" where the only time I was allowed to work on the game was when I was up in the air. I was up to the task, but apparently my laptop battery wasn't, so it didn't quite work out as well as I wanted it to. The lack of free Google didn't help either, but I managed to figure out all the things I needed to. Oh well, at the end of the day, I had fun and made a simple little game. Only implemented feature that I didn't get working was the High Score for the number of asteroids shot.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Space - Shoot</p><p>Arrows - Move</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["bamhm182"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
