The game has LOTS of poorly made areas, and the ending kinda broke...so just quit after falling. Also there are spelling and grammar mistakes caused by me changing\u00a0 the dialogue poorly. The game was made in a\u00a0 couple of hours, so i just hope it works.</p>\n\n<p>Also, thanks for the guys at freesound.org for the SFX, as well as the person where I got the font from (I used it a long time ago)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1c/a1c66e1b496de69a8a9d7cb497afb885.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supah Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
