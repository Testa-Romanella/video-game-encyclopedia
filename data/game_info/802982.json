In order to do this, he must first go through many other memories to reach the one he desires to erase. Unfortunately, the machine allowing him to do this amplifies the memories at their highest state, meaning bad memories will become nightmares!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a work in progress as it is my first ever game made using Unity. This is also only a free demo.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: I am currently unsure if I will 100% finish the game. This will be determined on how well this demo does and whether or not people enjoy it enough to see it finished and maybe even updated.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE LEAVE FEEDBACK! ANY WILL HELP ME!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T12:28:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cf/6cf0381807c6f23b4f830f6d29606113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BMP Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
