It is a top-down Adventure Game where there is a timer. Everytime the timer reaches 0, you are teleported back to the start, The Map changes entirely as you do.\u00a0You have 50 seconds to explore a ZONE and find the source Egg. If you find the egg then break it and that area won't spawn again. Find all 4 eggs and break them, and you have escaped the Wrong Dimension.\u00a0 Enjoy.</p>\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by BlackThornProd's \"The Game Creation Recipe\", their Youtube -\u00a0BlackThornProd</p>\n<p>This is my Entry for \"Brackeys Game Jam 2023.1\", My first time in a Brackeys jam.</p>\n<p>I am an Indie Game Dev.
