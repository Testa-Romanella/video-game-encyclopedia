Forced to eject from her malfunctioning starcraft, <strong>The Seeker</strong> is marooned on a tiny island surrounded by an endless alien ocean, with nothing but her amphibious survival pod. Throughout her underwater journey to reach her crashed starcraft, she'll uncover the lost history of this planet reclaimed by the elements, and learn the true nature of why she ended up here.<br/><br/>A story-driven game inspired largely by the psychedelic sci-fi of the '70s and '80s, Aquamarine combines old-school roguelikes and the survival genre with the exploration and puzzle solving of classic point-and-click adventures.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T02:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d634f733f2af2dfe3b975b5871c3e45.jpg", "website": "https://www.aquamarinegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Moebial Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hitcents", "Moebial Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
