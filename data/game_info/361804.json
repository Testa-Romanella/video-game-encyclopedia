I thought that I needed some recurring mechanic so I figured a nice twist would be that it gets stuck in the ground and you have to get near it and loosen it from the dirt while enemies are bearing down on you. It becomes a space and interaction management game with a feel similar to the original Nazi Zombies.</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Left Click:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>With\u00a0Sword - swing sword</li><li>Near Sword in ground - loosen</li></ul>\n<p>Just pretend the enemies hurt you.\u00a0Didn't get as much implemented as I would have liked.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f41654211869313c77462ee4828b813.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GIGITYMcD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
