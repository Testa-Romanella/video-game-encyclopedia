Four models in the Series were produced for the North American market, the ES40DC, ES44DC, ES44AC and ES44C4, all with a low emission four-stroke diesel engine. <br/><br/>The ES44DC replaced the Dash 9-44CW model in GE\u2019s locomotive roster, and are similar in appearance to the Dash 9 and AC4400CW, although small differences are evident.
