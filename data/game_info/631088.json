She is unsure on how open she can be about her sexuality and her girlfriend, Emma, when it comes to her new coworkers. For one year she needs to navigate different social situations and make decisions when it comes to how open she wants to be with the secretary, Jeremy, her coworker, Derek, and their boss, Cecile.</p>\n<p>At the end of the year she, and you as a player, have an important choice to make. The outcome of that choice is determined by the way you have acted throughout the earlier year. Ready to start your new job?</p>\n\n<p>The game is based on a branching narrative with interactive storypoints. With gorgeous art, and an incredibly catchy soundtrack the game is a joy to play, not to mention that the story itself lends itself to multiple replays of the game.</p>\r\nRobin:\r\n<p>Robin is the main character, and a young queer woman just trying to find her place in the world. When she starts her new job at\u00a0<em>Umbrella Corporation</em> she gets to meet new people and finds herself in new situations. Throughout the year at her workplace she needs to survive all the social situations surrounding her, and maybe even find the courage to come out to her coworkers?</p>\r\nJeremy:\r\n<p>Jeremy is a secretary at\u00a0<em>Umbrella Corporation</em>, with a strong work ethic and an even stronger sense of sarcasm (and a liver of steel). Jeremy is very perceptive and sassy, but also offers support to Robin while they work together.</p>\r\nDerek:\r\n<p>Derek is Robin's new coworker, with skills in IT and flirting. He is the very definition of an extrovert and constantly asks the rest of the team out for drinks. He is also a huge fan of beers (even though his tolerance for them is quite low) and is eager to get to know Robin better.</p>\r\nCecile:\r\n<p>Cecile is the supervisor of their team and Robin's boss. Despite her professional no-nonsense attitude she is actually a very warm and kind person. She is happy to have Robin on the team as another woman, and is always ready to help and defend Robin in different social situations.</p>\n<p><em>The game was made during \"Pride Game Jam\" on the weekend of 2-4.7.2021.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2de/2de9fc5ab8d23e73a55cf6feea80df63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cecil Opia", "Jintastic", "tarina", "Sajurca", "redmarmotte"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
