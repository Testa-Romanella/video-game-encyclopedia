You walk towards the small house, footsteps crunching loudly in the snow. You hear the car behind you slowly fade into the distance as you step up the stairs to the door. You lift your fist to alert Nathan, your caretaker, of your arrival, and with a loud rapping, you are sure he would hear. You hear the creak of the front door, and expect to hear Nathan's voice welcoming you. Silence. A small amount of warmth emanates from the interior, feeling angelic compared to the harsh winter cold, and you realize that the door is cracked open. You wait for a response as you listen to the calm, melodic chirping of unseen multitudes of birds. Several long seconds pass. You try again, but no response comes from the house. You press the doorbell and hear a distant chiming of bells. Nothing. With growing concern, you pull your phone from your pocket and send a message to Abel, hoping he will be awake despite the time difference. You were not prepared for this; with no caretaker, you will be forced to sit in the snow until someone helps you navigate. Stupid injury. If only you could understand what you're seeing and where to go, you wouldn't be in this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou awaken on a cold, winter night, your nightmares depriving you of much-needed sleep. You have yet another conference that morning, so you roll over and try to dispel your fears. Then, without warning, you hear a loud crash from somewhere outside. You didn't bring pets or family with you, which leaves few good options for the cause of the disturbance. You struggle to think what to do when suddenly your phone emits a pleasant little ding. You wonder who is texting you this late at night, but turn it on anyway. It's Elijah, your youngest brother. He says his caretaker won't come to the door when he knocks. Now that you know it's Elijah, you dispel all thoughts of going back to sleep. He received a serious brain trauma a few years ago, and he has a hard time making sense of environments, let alone walking around in his multi-story house. Debating whether to tell him to just go inside or to wait, you start typing a reply, but suddenly stop. From the hallway outside, you hear loud, ominous footsteps. Just like your nightmare. You scramble under the bed, knowing that you would be defenseless against a burglar, especially if he was armed. Heart pounding, you stifle your breath as the door creaks open and the footsteps tromp closer. Closer. Closer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWelcome to Terror for Two.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTerror for Two is a hardcore, survival horror experience with a twist.
