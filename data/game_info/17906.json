This was one of the ways to improve the game City Life and bring more detailed and grander experience. But it became a single-player game, due to the lack of online subscriptions, so now any new player will have the tools and possibilities, meant for a much bigger project. Cities XL Platinum edition of the game added even more features.<br />\nThe gameplay is straightforward \u2013 players have access to the resources and landscape, and they have to build a city with a working infrastructure. Three types of building can be built in the assigned zones: Reside, Commercial and Industrial. Social classes of potential residents can separate residential areas. The task is to run a simulation of a functional city, where the mayor has to listen to the concerns of residents, building and fixing roads and means of public transportation and make sure, that there\u2019s always enough energy and resources. Players will be able to build more than 1000 buildings on 60 expansive maps.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-17T15:47:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/264/264b921f97923e16f381117759262858.jpg", "website": "http://www.citiesxl.com/", "rating": 3.32, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 50, "owned": 1195, "beaten": 20, "dropped": 43, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 72, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 72, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Focus Home Interactive"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Focus Home Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
