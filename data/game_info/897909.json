And that dragon, is, me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am Krogar, the green dragon, and I am on a mission to eat and fly. But it's not as easy as it sounds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have to be careful where I get my food. Cattle and sheep are always a good choice, but I have to avoid the villagers or they'll try to kill me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And I have to be careful not to eat too much. If I get too fat and round, it will be too easy for my enemies to take me down. But if I don't eat enough, I won't have the energy to survive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The key to success is finding the right balance. And I have a big goal to achieve - I need to find 10 treasure chests to satisfy my hunger. Don't let me down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developers:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Mohsen: Programmer / Technical Artist</p>\n<p>Cole: Programmer / Designer</p>\n<p>Alan: Project Manager / UI Artist</p>\n<p>Ameer: Music / SFX Artist</p>\n<p>Angelo: 2D Artist</p>\n<p>Benjamin: Narrative / Voice Acting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T14:49:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e3/4e3cb9931a5ca8d0a456250f481da547.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Zantty", "BlockSquad1000", "MR_888"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
