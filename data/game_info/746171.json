Say \"baaa\" randomly.</p>\n<p>As their sheepdog, your job is to prevent all their stupidity from occurring.</p>\n<p>Herd them into neat squares. Rescue them from their far flung corners. And teach them real sheepdog discipline\u2014not that namby pamby stuff they get from wannabes like Beagles and Germans Shepherds. No. You, the Broader Collie, and the real best sheepdog.</p>\n<p>But as you herd, beware the cursed sheep! It's not really evil, it's just whack. Handle it with care.</p>\n<p>So long and enjoy.</p>\n<p>Woof!</p>\n<p>Developer's note: it\u2019s possible to access all the levels without first having to play through each one sequentially. Just use the level select. So if your collie brain is like a sheep\u2019s and you can\u2019t get past a level, you can at least explore all of them. And yes, they are all solvable.
