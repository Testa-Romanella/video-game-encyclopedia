But be warned, as dangerous nextbots will be lurking on other radio channels and are ready to\u00a0rise from the grave...</p>\n\n<p>Complete all of Munci's stages to collect all 5 gifts!</p>\n\n<p>Note (A): This game's primary mechanic centers around audio cues and careful listening. Unfortunately, those who are hard-of-hearing will not be able to enjoy this experience.</p>\n<p>Note (B): This game uses high-definition graphics that require a decent PC to run. A non-gaming laptop will likely not be powerful enough. I am currently attempting to create a lightweight version, but it's a work in progress!</p>PLEASE report all bugs by emailing me:support@derndeff.com\r\n\r\nThe Story of How I Made This Game:\r\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T13:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a89c9cd80486dfac9dfaa0182d22765.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Derndeff"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
