The grid stuff is based on some ideas I've had bumping around in my head ever since I played the game Loot Rascals a few years ago, which has a grid-like position-based buffing system.</p>\n<p>I hope to keep developing this game, so any feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Some things I have in mind to add:</p>\n<ul><li>More allies, items, and indulgences and a more involved metagame for unlocking these things</li><li>An ally leveling system (probably something similar to DOTA Underlords where your ally automatically levels when you own 3 of the same)</li><li>General graphical upgrades, bugfixes, and quality of life improvements</li></ul>\n\r\nAllies\r\n<br/>Name<br/>$<br/>ATK<br/>DEFOn Turn<br/>Special Ability<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Recusant Friar<br/>312Attacks random enemy in closest occupied column<br/>On Death: Summon (1/1) Spirit Friars to all empty cells in row<br/>Heretic Assassin<br/>3<br/>2<br/>2<br/>Attacks random enemy in closest occupied column<br/>Before battle: Deal 1 damage to 1 random enemy<br/>Altar Beast<br/>321Attacks random enemy in closest occupied columnAlly summoned: Give +1/+1 to summoned allies.Faithless Pylon<br/>211Attacks random cell (may be empty)<br/>On Damage Enemy: Removes damaged enemy's ability for rest of battle (not including items)Cell Welder<br/>332Attacks random enemy in closest occupied columnBefore Death: Give +3/+3 to ally in Cell 5Prophet's Guardian????UNLOCK THIS ALLY TO LEARN MORE : )<br/>Hero Slayer????UNLOCK THIS ALLY TO LEARN MORE : )\r\nItems\r\n<br/>Name$EffectEffect when paired<br/> <br/>Orbis Incursio2+1 AttackCONSUMED ON USE<br/>Orbis Vigor2+1 Health<br/>CONSUMED ON USE<br/>Anulus Terrorum<br/>3<br/>On Death: Summons one 2/2 War Automaton<br/>Summons one 5/5 War Automaton<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>Hormonal Amplifier3Attacks targeting an ally are drawn to ally with Hormonal Amplifier instead.Attacks targeting an ally are drawn to ally with Hormonal Amplifier instead and cause 1 less damage.Book Of The True Cell3Start of Round: If in Cell 5, attack a random enemy with 50% attackStart of Round: If in Cell 5, attack a random enemy with 100% attack\r\nIndulgences\r\n<br/>NameEffectAll ImbueAll summons gain +1/+1EssentiaSell allies for an exra +1 essenceCell VeritasOn entering the store: Give ally in cell 5 +4 health\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game Design and Programming by Mickey Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Music by Brendan McCracken / icynotes. <br/></p>\n<p>Detailed feedback and playtesting by Brendan McCracken, Ryan Kubik, and Alternasports LLC.<br/></p>\n<p>Additional playtesting and feedback:</p>\n<ul><li>Nick Cummings<br/></li><li>Kartik Kini<br/></li><li>Christian Scandariato<br/></li><li>Chris Sumsky<br/></li></ul>\n<p>Character art and some item art comes from Penusbmic:\u00a0https://penusbmic.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Sound effects created with JFXR: https://jfxr.frozenfractal.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Fonts:</p>\n<ul><li>Weiholmir by JustFredrik \r\n<ul><li>https://justfredrik.itch.io/weiholmir</li></ul></li><li>monogram by datagoblin<ul><li>https://datagoblin.itch.io/monogram</li></ul></li><li>Royal Decree by VEXED<ul><li>https://v3x3d.itch.io/royal-decree</li></ul></li><li>Witchcraft &amp; Black Magic by Insanus <br/><ul><li>https://insanus.itch.io/witchcraft-and-black-magic</li></ul></li></ul>\r\nWishlist", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T08:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dd/0ddb17efa872a00116c33c58faa49b16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["New Beings"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
