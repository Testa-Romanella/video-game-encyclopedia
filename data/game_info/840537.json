You have been ordered to shoot down enemy spaceships. Yeah I guess that's it, there's no real storyline, it's all randomly generated anyways. Just try to hit highscores\u00a0I guess? It's not meant to be interesting, just slightly addicting and a little thing to play around with when you are bored. Feature\u00a0 requests in the comments, please, and thanks for playing my game! Also it's free for the first month, so get it as soon as you can. After this, it will be priced at 2$.</p>\r\n\r\nCONTROLS:\u00a0\r\n<p>The blue player spaceship is controlled by moving your mouse up and down. Find a spot you believe you could hit a red enemy spaceship from, and either click with your mouse, or use your spacebar.</p>\r\nTHANKS!\r\n<p>Thanks for being here, if you like the game, please do tell your friends or whatever, you can even tell your pet goldfish, it really does help. No donations yet, though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T15:25:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/092/0928f25d94051bfbc7ac9f21360fba6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bixten"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
