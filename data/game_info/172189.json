You type the words above corresponding enemies to kill them. Some take more hits than others and to make things harder, the words change every hit.</p><p>The game features 3 types of enemies: zombie (slow but takes the most hits to kill), crab (fast and can jump at the player) and a shooter zombie (can fire projectiles at the player).</p><p>You can also move around using the mouse click. Use it to run away from approaching enemies and their projectiles. Try playing with a friend if you're having trouble switching between the mouse and keyboard fast enough. Enjoy!</p><p>Made in C++/SDL2.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c5533e0680fa7c7f60801ffa7303407.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chudej"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
