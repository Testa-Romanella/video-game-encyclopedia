The player can explore the world by teleporting around and playing with all the various interactive objects to be found, but can also resize the world around them to investigate tiny areas or view the world as a giant.</p><p>The usual game jam drama ensued, included 1 member of the team (Cash) losing their laptop due to a cooling failure and resulting molten CPU. RIP trusty dev laptop.</p><p>It was a lot of fun to work on and we are excited to keep adding to our little world with more interactive objects and puzzle elements, as well as expanding the achievement system we added to give the player some direction while they explore.</p><p>We hope you enjoy what the world has to offer so far! We would love to hear any feedback or ideas of stuff to add to our little planet. :)</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p><strong>Teleport:</strong> Primary controller button + trigger<br/><strong>Player Scaling:</strong> Hold both triggers at once and move your arms closer or farther apart<br/><strong>Interacting with Objects:</strong> Grip trigger to pick up an object, trigger to activate triggerable objects<br/><strong>Exit:</strong> Alt-F4 or HMD menu (sorry, the UX flow never made it to the top of the todo list &gt;&lt;)</p><p><strong>Team:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cash Garman</strong></p>\n<p>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/cashgarman</p>\n<p>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cash-garman-73923a54/</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lee Walker</strong></p>\n<p>LinkedIn:\u00a0www.linkedin.com/in/lee-walker-xrdev</p>\n<p><strong>Kristen Montesano</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter: @krismontesano</p>\n<p>Website:\u00a0kristenmontesano.com\\</p>\n<p>Itch.io:\u00a0https://kristen24.itch.io/<br/></p><p>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristenmontesano-583857138/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T10:17:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/209/209e765cf430683fd871abe6ca7d384f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["cashgarman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
