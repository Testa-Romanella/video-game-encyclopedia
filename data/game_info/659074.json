Because they were afraid of his ability and no one knew what his actions would bring.</p>\n<p>The story of the game begins with a very personal little and gradually expands. The worldview is from modern to fantasy.</p>\n<p>Scientifically, God explains the existence of beings, and you can see from basic mathematics/science to university-level mathematics in certain areas.</p>\n<p>The big frame of the story tells the process of Exto becoming a god.</p>\n<p>However, if you look at the story in the game, it can be interpreted differently depending on the player's age.</p>\n<p>The focus was on sacrificing among the stories of the birth of heroes from all over the world. I reinterpreted Greek and Roman mythology in my own way and solved it by adding imagination to existing theology-related studies.</p>\n<p>This game has a total of four episodes.</p>\n<p>It's an offline game as a single play.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Part 1</strong> adventure with stories of the game.</p>\n<p>There is a main story and you can follow it.</p>\n<p>There are 163 creatures in total and you can talk to them.</p>\n<p>There are 75 maps and walk around and talk.</p>\n<p>Enjoying mini quests.</p>\n<p>You can enter the inner room and look at the characters' inner feelings.</p>\n<p>There are 2 kinds of ending, and the content does not change even if you play it repeatedly.</p>\n<p><this accurate.=\"\" by=\"\" conclusion=\"\" developer=\"\" is=\"\" made=\"\" main=\"\" not=\"\" playing=\"\" quest=\"\" repeatedly=\"\" sub-questing,=\"\" that=\"\" the=\"\" which=\"\" without=\"\"></this></p>\n<p>Shortest play time: 1 hour or less (if finished without seeing any text at all and never failed)</p>\n<p>Playtime: 2 hours or so (when looking at text)</p>\n<p>Playtime: Around 3 hours (when looking inside)</p>\n<p>When exploring non-main areas, I expect to double the playing time.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Part 2</strong> is a sandbox puzzle RPG game.</p>\n<p>You can solve 100 puzzles in your own way. Feed the monster a healing potion and the next puzzle will open.</p>\n<p>Basically, collection, logging, and mining are the basis.</p>\n<p>The customizing buttons allow you to stack blocks and place furniture on the map.</p>\n<p>You can freely make your own drawings and decorate the screen.</p>\n<p>You can make a boat and bring fish and seeds.</p>\n<p>You can make a rocket and go to another planet.</p>\n<p>You can make your own character by making hair, top, and pants and coloring them.</p>\n<p>The ending is one.</p>\n<p><it a=\"\" depending=\"\" enjoy=\"\" hope=\"\" how=\"\" i=\"\" it=\"\" it.=\"\" long=\"\" may=\"\" on=\"\" play=\"\" slowly.=\"\" take=\"\" time=\"\" you=\"\"></it></p>\n<p>- <strong>Part 3\u00a0\u00a0</strong>is a story-type mini game.</p>\n<p>There are 2 kinds of ending, and the content does not change even if you play it repeatedly.</p>\n<p><this accurate.=\"\" by=\"\" conclusion=\"\" developer=\"\" is=\"\" made=\"\" main=\"\" not=\"\" playing=\"\" quest=\"\" repeatedly=\"\" sub-questing,=\"\" that=\"\" the=\"\" which=\"\" without=\"\"></this></p>\n<p>Shortest play time: 10 minutes or less (if finished without seeing any text at all and never failed)</p>\n<p>Playtime: Around 20 minutes (when viewed by text)</p>\n<p>We expect a 10-minute increase in playtime during non-main regional exploration.</p>\n<p>-<strong> Part 4</strong> is the ending.</p>\n<p>Repeated play does not change the content.</p>\n<p>Shortest play time: 5 minutes or less (if no text is reported at all)</p>\n<p>\u25cf A game created by a single developer.</p>\n<p>\u25cf There are <strong>250</strong> different effects sounds.</p>\n<p>\u25cf background sound has <strong>100</strong> songs.</p>\n<p>(Piano music.
