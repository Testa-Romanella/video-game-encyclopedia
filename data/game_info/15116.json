Want to fly? Of course, you're a bug. Death from above! Want a more earthly approach? Stay grounded and enjoy a wealth of defensive benefits. When (if) you get tired of smashing your foes in the face, take a step back and throw some high-charged bolts of pure beetle fury. Of course, you could just bypass all that and fight the world itself. All terrain is fully destructible. Enjoy!<br/><br/>Whether you're a lone badass or a whole team of badasses, Bugspeed's got you covered. We have enough singleplayer challenges and AI enemies to keep even the most bloodthirsty bug satisfied. We also have a whole slew of options should you be more into the local multiplayer chaos scene. 1-4 players, with plenty of explosions to spare.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/794/794f6f9eb999aceae7ab69b23f9e86c7.jpg", "website": "http://www.skelefactor.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Skelefactor"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Skelefactor"], "esrb_rating": null}
