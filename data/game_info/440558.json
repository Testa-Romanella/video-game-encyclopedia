This game follows him from college to the end of his Atari days, with alternate endings that could have been possible for him. There\u00a0are four endings with two ways to fail along the way. One run through of the game shouldn't last more than 15 minutes. This game was made using Twine, I hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T04:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/705/705de35ebae9cfeb47d5c867bec08e96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["delrthtak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
