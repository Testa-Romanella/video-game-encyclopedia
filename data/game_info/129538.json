The pipe (sometimes over the backslash) can be confused for an i or L. Hit enter when you've typed each word, or to clear out a mistake and try again.</em><br/></p>\n<p>When you see words or special characters over the invaders, type them and hit enter. If you're successful, they will crash and burn... If they reach your base... Well, don't let them reach your base.</p>\n<p>This is a game jam entry, so it was done in a limited time with minimal polish. The font limitations make some characters difficult to make out, parenthesis () versus braces {}, and pipes | resemble 1 and capital i. And you can't backspace to correct a word. If you've typed something wrong, just hit enter and start over.</p>\n<p>When I've taken some time to think through the issues I know of (and any pointed out to me) I will clean it up a bit to make it more palatable, but leave the simplicity intact. I hope you enjoy it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77b/77b9849aebb16bdd9fd95543e3997721.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["karlgg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
