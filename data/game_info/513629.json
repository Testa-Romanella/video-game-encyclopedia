There isn't really a goal here other than to be scared, and a playthrough should last 5 to 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy. I've also included the 'classic' edition of Spectre. Please don't play it, it's terrible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T04:20:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4a/b4a7777b8b855725851c7d1f67fd8356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Figglewatts"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
