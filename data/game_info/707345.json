Despite being surrounded on all sides, Empress Karvia remains confident that she will prevail. After all, she has a secret task force under her command, one that served her well in the war against the goddess: The \u201cBlack Arme Vapula,\u201d led by the war hero Leonhardt Arknoah.Gameplay Features<br />\nBattalion Battles (Triple Squad Battles)<br />\nIn this new instalment of the Venusblood series, we present you with the new &quot;Battalion Battle&quot; system!
