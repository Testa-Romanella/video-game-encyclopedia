Giant stone guardians guard the place, who will try to kill you as soon as they get aware of you. It is wise to silently sneak past them, but once detected, a skilled player can even manage to dodge the attacks and reach the top of the tower that way. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 With our game, we want to convey a sense of domination and oppression through an enormous, but also surreal and otherworldly environment compared to a lone small assassin whose only advantage is swiftness and silence. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Song of the Lone Assassin combines well-known gameplay elements like sneaking and dodging attacks with a unique approach of vertical path-finding by twisting the gravity of the player and letting them experience the environment through a whole other perspective time and time again. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0This project is on hold for now, but we plan to continue to develop it in the future. We would love to hear your feedback!\u00a0 \u00a0 <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T06:03:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/021f245a967bd765fd8784dfea78aa51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hanka-fritz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
