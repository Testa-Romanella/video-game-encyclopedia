{"id": 358355, "slug": "just-keep-moving", "name": "Just Keep Moving!", "name_original": "Just Keep Moving!", "description": "<p>Just Keep Moving! is a pretty simple game concept where you need to guide coins into pots without touching the pots or the coins! When you get within 2 squares of a coin, it'll start following you, and coins will randomly spawn on the playfield every second. There's no win condition (like classic arcade games, though there's not even a pause option, 'cause I didn't have enough time o.o) -- just keep going for as long as you can!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>WASD to move. We recommend playing it in full-screen mode (poke the blue button in the player window, and esc to leave full-screen mode. :)\u00a0)</p>\n<p><strong>Your aim</strong><br/>Don't hit anything! o.<br/></p>\n<p>Gold coins move faster than silver coins move faster than bronze coins.</p>\n<p>Your hitbox is tiny, so you get a fair bit of leeway in what's counted as a 'hit'. :)</p>\n<p>TODO: Add three hearts, and maybe a score multiplier for remaining hearts.</p>\n<p><strong>Why?</strong><br/>Entry for Weekly Game Jam 107. Didn't really have much time to do much work on\u00a0it though due to work constraints. :(</p>\n<p><strong>Who wrote that amazing background music? :o</strong><br/>Mmmmmeeeeeeee! :D</p>\n<p><strong>Unity Analytics<br/></strong>This game collects high score data (score, and time it took to get it) into Unity Analytics, mainly 'cause I'm interested to see if anyone can beat me. xD Everything else is discarded.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T07:43:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/251/251a43c45dd3b5f589256b20cea13e32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenjaminNolan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
