It consists of a procedurally generated scene with randomly generated terrain, animated water, clouds and altitude based textures.</p>\n<p>Being my first experience with procedural mesh generation, I used all previously learnt skills with C++ and OpenGL. Throughout the creation of this generator, I learnt a lot about the use of Perlin Noise and the Diamond-Square algorithm.\r\n    </p>\n<p>This project consists of a procedural generated mountain/island surrounded by animated water with clouds overhead and surounded with a skybox. The mountains are generated using the Diamond-Square algorithm and the intensity was amplified to allow for more dramatic peaks. The water is simply animated using Sine waves (both on a small scale for small ripples and large scale for overall waves). The clouds use a Perlin Noise generator. A skybox is also included and both the mountains and waves transition between textures in their fragment shaders based off height position provided by their vertex shaders.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Build files to try out the generator are available on this page, source files are available on github at the following link: https://github.com/GameDevChris/OpenGL-Procedural-Terrain-Generator<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T07:48:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df4/df4b2781b95264c178751b1032222cf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bodsworthcm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
