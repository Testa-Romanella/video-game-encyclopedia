But here is another challenge for you all, for how many decimals of Pi can you survive in Sticky Pi Challenge?<br/></p>\n<p>Sticky Pi Challenge is an infinite* platformer that could be described as being spun out of the dreams of a math student falling asleep during class while going through the exciting number that is Pi. For some reason our protagonist is stuck in a world where there are blocks coming towards our hero. Some of them has numbers on them and our hero immediately recognizes them to be decimals in pi, in a correct sequence even.</p>\n<p>While trying to survive our hero must jump between the blocks and avoid explosions, fire, Pi missiles and falling to a gruesome death in the depths of math world. While trying to stay alive the only thought is... just one more decimal.</p>\n<p>* Well ok there is a hard limit at one million decimals of Pi but if anyone makes it that far that person should take a screenshot and then turn off the computer and go to sleep. The developers promise to extend the game with another million decimals.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T09:02:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/6601750492906d5617fba675f9b4fb22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dudeinc"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
