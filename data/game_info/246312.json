I had this idea and thought it would be fun to develop. This is my first time doing anything like this, and\u00a0 I have had limited resources (laptop/touchpad and paint), and some aspect could probably do with some fine tuning. Unfortunately\u00a0I have run out of time to work on it for now, but wanted to get it out there for everyone to enjoy.</p>\n<p>I plan on working on it more if people are interested in it. And if there is enough interest, I have some ideas for another game based on The Dark Side.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I would love to hear what you think of it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p><p>Music by Tombofry.
