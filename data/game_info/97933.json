In <em>Klobbe!</em>, you play as the ambitious tank Klobbe and help them on their journey to become a cloud. Starting in Klobbe's factory and exploring seven progressively more difficult levels, all animated with lovely, storybook illustrations by Kate Triantafelow, <em>Klobbe!</em> is a simple and enjoyable game about following your dreams and also there are bears. </p><p><strong>Instructions</strong><br/></p><p><strong>W:</strong> Jump</p><p><strong>D:</strong> Shoot</p><p><strong>S:</strong> Duck</p><p><strong>S -&gt; W:</strong> Super Jump!</p><p><strong>S -&gt; D:</strong> Super Shoot!</p><p><strong>R:</strong> Quick restart after losing</p><p><strong>Space:</strong> Pause</p><p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hey! Some of these assets are white squares!</strong><ul><li>Ah, you've angered the secret snow wizard that affects random assets and turns them completely white. The only way to conquer that wily wizard is to close the game and restart it a few times, the assets should fix themselves. If that doesn't work, contact us and we'll send you a GIF of the snow wizard apologizing for being a jerk. We're working on a way to banish the snow wizard permanently. </li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Hey! How come Klobbe is floating/how come Klobbe is stuck in a jump animation/how come Klobbe wants to be a... cloud?</strong><ul><li>That is an excellent and well-asked question.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Hey! Klobbe is a little slow to react to my commands, how come that?</strong></li><ul><li>Klobbe is an old tank that wants to be a cloud, so they're a little slow. Gotta tell them what to do quickly!</li></ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Hey! Klobbe died when I pressed the X key?</strong><ul><li>Well, don't do that.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>Brobotic Studios</p><p>Programmed by Matthew Mohr (@mathyoumore)</p><p>Illustrated by Kate Triantafelow (@KateTelo, https://www.facebook.com/KateTelo/)</p><p>Music</p><p>\"Carpe Diem\"</p><p>\"Danger Storm\"</p><p>\"Fretless\"</p><p>\"The Curtain Rises\"</p><p>\"On My Way\"</p><p>\"Quirky Dog\"</p><p>\"Rainbows\"</p><p>\"The Builder\"</p><p>\"The Show Must Be Go\"</p><p>All by Kevin Macleod</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0</p><p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>www.Incompetech.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa7/aa71627253a6be7b9efea0d6e0da1f0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brobotic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
