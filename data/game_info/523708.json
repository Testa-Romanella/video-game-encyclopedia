Explore the scenic countryside and take in all the \"charming\" sights it has to offer. Chat with the locals, get stung by bees, and break into private property all on your Nintendo GameBoy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created using GBStudio and really does run on your GameBoy. That tagline up above ain't lying. You can download the ROM and either play it on an emulator or plop it onto a flashcart and get the true monochrome experience, it's your choice. I guess you could also play in the browser... but where's the fun in that?</p>\n\n<p>I am greatly appreciative of anyone who decides to download the game, even if you end up hating it. I am not a game developer and just wanted to tell a story that hopefully makes you\u2014the player\u2014feel something. Oh, also, if you find any bugs, please let me know in the comments. I had my multi-million dollar QA team extensively comb the game for glitches, but it's possible they might have missed something. Let me know, and then I'll figure out who to fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Kirb</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T06:21:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/1274b267710904165f71bda25536e3e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kirb69"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
