Those were our personnal constraints, but you'll see that a real emotional state is triggered when the player feels the inner conflict of both his soul and the character intentionnality in this sad.......</p>\n<p>Naaaaah just kidding, it's a racing - rythm Jam game.</p>\n<p>We still did our best for you to have a good time though. We had a good time on our own anyway. We hope you'll like our little creation =)</p>\n<p>Enjoy !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f2/8f23ce9c36d4121450f0da101759202a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Minimata"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
