Your life\u2019s long work is on this drive, and you are RUNNING OUT OF SPACE. You are struggling to keep the important documents safe in non-encrypted parts of the drive. To save your file you will need to collect bits and bytes of data which you will need to place in the decryptor to reveal the hackers IP address and open the WWW port that the attack came from. Once the port is open you will create a secure connection and all your data will be saved to the cloud. With your new found information you will be able to launch an attack on the hacker and infiltrate their system for some revenge.\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck with saving your data.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T04:41:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca5/ca5667f4c3aa934275407ade0f449579.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Waltech"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
