The system starts with random traits and random \"creatures,\" whose traits include sex (male - solid, female - outlines), kingdom (carnivore, herbivore, plant) and various physical traits like speed, shape and color.</p><p>Depending on the circumstances, animals (i.e. not plants) will attempt to feed and breed appropriately to their kingdom; you can observe the generational shifts in the ecosystem as some species die out and other become more and more dominant - note that animals can only breed within their kingdom and not with their own immediate family.</p><p>The simulation is incomplete and, as stated, rudimentary. The main focus of the development process was exploring the necessary priorities in programming a functioning ecosystem, essentially a subsystem prototype for a later game.</p><p>Either way, I hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99a/99a0fa936f3124b2a9de8f18d0f86618.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silas Grarup"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
