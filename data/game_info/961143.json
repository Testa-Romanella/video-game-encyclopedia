You play as DIPPER, a robot who\u2019s sent to an alien planet named Pogglerock, home to the Pogglewonks, Gloons, and Wubaroos. Unfortunately, the planet is completely covered in goop, but the Pogglewonks don\u2019t have the hands to clean it with. That\u2019s why DIPPER\u2019s mission is to clean it up with his water gun! DIPPER cleans his way through and restores this beautiful alien landscape, helping and being helped by the Pogglewonks in turn, and receiving shiny star-shaped crystals for his efforts. Just be careful around those idyllic shores! Robots aren\u2019t very good at swimming, after all.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Engaging 3rd person platforming and shooting<br/></li><li>Vibrant tropical islands to explore <br/></li><li>Dynamic level music<br/></li><li>The Adorable Pogglewonks</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
