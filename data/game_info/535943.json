Why not play both?</p>\n<p>Tetrisweeper is\u00a0a mind-bending fusion of two classic puzzle games that\u00a0will have you working two parts of your mind at once.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In order to win this game, you'll have to play both\u00a0Tetris and Minesweeper at the same time. Block fall just like Tetris, but every square inside operates like a Minesweeper tile. In order to clear a row, you must fill every empty space\u00a0<em>and</em> solve each tile's minesweeper puzzle. Let the tower reach the top, or accidently click on a mine, and that's game over.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Left/Right, A/D\u00a0- Move block</p>\n<p>W, Up - Rotate block</p>\n<p>D, Down - Speed up</p>\n<p>Left Click tile to reveal it.</p>\n<p>Right Click tile to flag it.<br/></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The FontStruction \u201cMINE-SWEEPER\u201d (https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1501665) by Gangetsha Lyx is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).</p>\n<p>Poinl \u201cTwister Tetris\u201d\u00a0(https://opengameart.org/content/twister-tetris by Gangetsha Lyx is\u00a0licensed under a Creative Commons license (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:15:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/853696aa577445fbd130d31b3827e4d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kertis Jones"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
