The older they get, the more energy they release. This property made it trivial for the Oblets to build their own Utopia, appropriately named Obletopia. Although killing large amounts of our kind is bad for us, for the Oblets, it's just your average day. This is because Oblets can multiply very easily, allowing their societies to grow at incredible speeds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:41:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b46/b46a2390cb7e385ec6c97d0505d89c72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ciber_Turtle"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
