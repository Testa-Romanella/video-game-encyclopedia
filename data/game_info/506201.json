Inspired by the enthusiastic feedback that the game got, the two researchers got motivated to turn this small experiment into a fully fleshed out nightmare.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>What happens after the game has been released?</strong><br/>Then we will start working on the first of two planned, standalone, extra stories.
