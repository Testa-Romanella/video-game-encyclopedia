The wrapper supports up to four actors with expression changes using the Ink engine for interpreting the game's script (a .JSON file).</p>\r\nWhat was the original story for the game?\r\n<p>The original story was going to be that the protagonist\u00a0(Angelica) was targeted by a shady CEO of a talent company for her beautiful singing voice, as part of \u201cProject Christine\u201d, where he used his connections to hijack the self-driving AI cars in the city to stage car accidents for the most talented girls he could find (actors, singers, dancers etc.) in order to revive the love of his life, a woman known as Christine, who had died several years ago in a freak accident. As he believed that she was the perfect woman, he believed he needed the souls of other talented girls to sacrifice them in order to bring her back to life. The protagonist\u2019s soul was only saved due to the intervention of her guardian angel and her close ties and urge to protect her younger sister, as well as her confusion at her sudden death, which meant she was allowed one last chance to clear up her loose ends before going to heaven.<br/><br/>Ideally there would have been several different endings, with the true ending allowing the main character\u00a0to come back to life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T09:14:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d1/6d194febd23fe95af1010a88dbe5344d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Craig Horsley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
