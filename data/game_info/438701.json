You learn quickly that it\u2019s the final days of your semester, and your cluster housing mates are unhappy with how you\u2019ve conducted yourself in the last\u202624?\u2026hours. You\u2019re given a challenge, and a time limit.</p>\n<p>---</p>\r\nHow the Work Relates to the Theme: Apocalypse\r\n<p>I wanted to build a story that examined on time and endings. I used the greek definition of Apocalypse to direct my making; Apocalypse (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2) is a Greek word meaning \u201crevelation\u201d, \u201can unveiling or unfolding of things not previously known and which could not be known apart from the unveiling\u201d. I liked the idea that a character would both uncover what had happened as they went along, and that their understanding would come from retracing steps of things that had already happened.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to examine the bravery or perhaps more aptly bold and reckless behaviour that\u00a0<em>endings</em>\u00a0inspire. For my story, it\u2019s the end of a semester and for this, I drew on personal experience. No matter how well (or poorly) a semester went, I would always\u00a0<em>ALWAYS</em>\u00a0do something foolish and rash in the final days before break. Looking back, I can find no motivation or reason other than it being my response to something \u201cending\u201d.</p>\n<p>Finally, I wanted to focus on time and how it is even more of an enemy to those with any kind of quotidian physical challenge. A hangover, to an able bodied human, is usually the result of a (or a series of) bad choice(s) that can be shaken off in a day or two and the time lost is negligible. But to someone restricted to a mobility device, where their ability to do or accomplish tasks during the day are already restricted by access, their energy and wellness, and the behaviour of those around them \u2013 what does it mean to be on a time-limit when your body is further impaired by self-inflicted indulgence.</p>\n<p>Hilariously - I ran out of time, focused on back-end things, and so I share this WIP with y'all with the intention of continuing my musings and exploration of these themes in the coming months.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T02:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/988eedf101da32cc9a22148dbf2fb48c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kay@thepapercutarcade.ca"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
