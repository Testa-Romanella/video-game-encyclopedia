The game is set in a fictional world 20 years after its predecessor,  following new story, new possibilities and new threats for the world.</p>\n<p>The game\u2019s main character, a paladin in servitude to the Divine, is forced to be joined with a death knight, his ideological nemesis. The main story is focused around their unwanted bond, and the game employs various mechanics regarding the control of two characters. Role-playing elements will allow the players to create a unique path for deuteragonists, and to find different ways to defeat their enemies. The game features lots of dialogue filled with witty humor, reflecting on the situation that our characters are in.</p>\n<p>Despite game\u2019s premise of a simple hack-and-slash adventure RPG, the problematic caverns and long dungeons will provide a great sense of challenge even to the veterans of the genre, as the game punishes every mistake that the player makes. However, considering the astonishing soundtrack and overall setting of the game, the difficulties can be set aside, as the game will allow the players to immerse in the journey truly.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2004-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:00:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f69/f69d51606fb5d72b462c75e8de9383f5.jpg", "website": "http://www.larian.com", "rating": 3.19, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 178, "owned": 2063, "beaten": 49, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 58, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 174, "suggestions_count": 603, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 176, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Larian Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Larian Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
