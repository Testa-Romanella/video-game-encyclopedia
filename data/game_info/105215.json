You can enjoy it single player, but if you have the option to sit down with a friend, we heartily recommend you do so!<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Leave a comment below or visit our forum (signup not required)</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS:</strong><br/>Ingame, press <strong>escape</strong> or <strong>start</strong> to bring up the menu, to change options and customise controls.</p>\n<p><strong>A second player can join in a game at any time after a game has started.</strong><br/> Press the spacebar to add a keyboard player, or the A button on a <br/>second connected pad.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Potions can be thrown; but be careful! Different colours have different effects.</strong><br/>They can also be placed safely on the ground if you aim at your feet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you find a locked gate, you must find the Skeleton key to exit the level.</strong><br/>It will be walking around the level somewhere!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Draw chalk marks on the walls / floors to avoid getting lost!</strong><br/>When you have no items equipped in your right hand, press left trigger to enter first person / drawing mode.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reload the gun!</strong><br/>It only holds one bullet at a time! Boxes of bullets can be found and the total amount is shared between both players.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Using the Sword:</strong><br/>You must hold the attack button for a short while to 'wind up' the attack. You can hold it for as long as you want. Running and attacking will give you greater reach.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read the books!</strong><br/>They hold information about enemies and magic chalk spells.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/14836ac15c538b4eca37368073d962dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Idle Creations"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
