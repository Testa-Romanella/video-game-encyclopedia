Your task is to solve the mystery of its missing people while serving food and moonshine to both city residents and demonic forces from a parallel world.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Serve your famous stew and drinks to customers. Be careful to do it right so the payment is adequate. <br/><br/></li><li>Help the locals, the resistance movement, and even the invading soldiers (at least the ones who are friendly!) by using your exquisite networking skills and natural charm.<br/><br/></li><li>Test your senses and serve simultaneously. You know, like a good bartender who pours the pint while chatting up his guests. <br/><br/></li><li>Immerse yourself in a wartime story with a supernatural twist.

It makes you the perfect double agent and you immediately start plotting with your former friends from the military. <br/><br/>The war is in its prime and the enemy is omnipresent. But that's not all. The market keeps getting weirder. First, you hear about the disappearances. On top of that, there are rumours about an odd military unit that has just arrived in the city. Since the day you heard about it, you\u2019ve kept having eerie recurring dreams about a monstrous entity slithering in the darkness and gazing at you with its many eyes.
