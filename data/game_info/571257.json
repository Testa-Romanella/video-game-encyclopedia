{"id": 571257, "slug": "interstellar-hearts", "name": "Interstellar Hearts", "name_original": "Interstellar Hearts", "description": "<p>While attempting to send out an SOS on the Garr-07 Space Station (Contact Command), Legacy Newbrooke is apprehended by aliens. Now being held as their prisoner, Legacy pleads for his freedom and cuts them a deal. These aliens, called the Garrozleans, have a deadly extraterrestrial virus afflicting their leader, Captain Scimitar. If Legacy can enter his heart and destroy the virus in question, he'll be granted his freedom and a ride home in the Garr-00, the most impressive of their series of space stations. Who knows... could it even bridge the gap between the Garrozleans and his kind as a whole? Using their advanced alien tech, they shrink Legacy down and inject him into their leader's heart. Can you help Legacy Newbrooke earn his freedom, or will you be destroyed by nasties before you even get the chance?\u00a0</p><p>Controls:\u00a0</p><p>Arrow Keys to Move.</p><p>Space to Reset. Make sure to use it if you die.\u00a0</p><p>Enemy/Creature Types:\u00a0</p><p>Purple Bacteria- These sentry style enemies can be found on patrol in a certain area of Scimitar's heart. If they make contact with you, you lose 1HP (Legacy has 5HP total).\u00a0</p><p>Yellow Amoeba- These horrible creatures were spawned by the virus itself, with their specialty being to drain the energy of anything they touch. Make sure to pass through these slimy scum only if you're sure you can spare the damage. If only someone could give you an energy boost...\u00a0</p><p>The Virus- The thing trying to kill Scimitar, and your ticket home. Tracking it down will result in a victory.\u00a0</p><p>Gold Jelly- A benevolent entity and friend that likes to hide in organ tissue. If you touch it, it will refill your health. Be aware, however, that he only spawns once and must be used at the best time possible. If you seek his help at a bad time and pay the price, you'll have to press Space and start over.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T08:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/967/9674511c13cd94c05eed4ae4fc08dc37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheFazbearLegacy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
