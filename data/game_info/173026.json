But be careful, the guards are equipped with powerful magnets that will attract you as you gather more coins!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/>Control you character with ASWD and move the camera with the mouse. You can stomp in the guards' heads to stop them for a while.<br/>When you get all the coins, the exit will open!</p>\n<p><strong>Comment</strong><br/>Personally, I'm very proud of this game. I've learned a lot making it. My challenges were to learn how to make animations in Blender and make a \"complete\" game, with Start screens, instructions and at least two stages.<br/>I've completed all of them.<br/>I hope you all play and have a little fun with it!<br/>Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37b/37bce5cd41591964e0d9eb2489aa5590.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Thiago Rodrigues"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
