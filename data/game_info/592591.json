Fill the NUISANCE METER to get arrested as quickly as possible!<br/></em></p>\n\n<p>This game was made in 4 hours for Trijam #117, the 3 hour game jam (I went a little over the time limit). The theme was \"Don't learn from mistakes - repeat!\", so my idea was a game where you're a petty criminal who wants to get arrested by repeatedly commiting petty crimes and nuisance acts! The player can then \"repeat\" the game to try and beat their time. Works on mobile and PC!<br/></p>\n<p>All artwork and gameplay was made by me in 4 hours. The music was made by me for a previous project before the jam. The sound effects are from various royalty free sources.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T10:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34f9b8ca7fe3e71eafec5bc926ea9bda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheoClarke"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
