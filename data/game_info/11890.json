It\u2019s the first N game on PC since 2004 and we\u2019ve spent those 12 years perfecting the platformer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nN++ is all about using your momentum to complete levels and get high scores, but in this sci-fi world, there\u2019s a slew of inadvertently homicidal enemy robots trying to prevent you from completing your goal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThrough the hand-crafted (NOT procedurally generated) levels, you\u2019ll experience platforming at its most intense. Using only your fluid movement, you need to \u2018solve\u2019 each level and get to the exit. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to the lengthy and challenging single player campaign, we\u2019ve packed a ton of features into this one last entry in the N series including:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-4,340 hand-made levels <br/>\r\n-Custom Levels, Level Editor &amp; Global Level Sharing<br/>\r\n-Leaderboards and replays for every level (even the ones you make)<br/>\r\n-Local Co-op Mode (up to 4 players)<br/>\r\n-Local Competitive Mode (up to 4 Players)<br/>\r\n-Hardcore Mode, an intense single-player challenge which only the best ninjas will survive<br/>\r\n-Intense, hidden Secret challenges to discover<br/>\r\n-63 tracks by top electronic artists<br/>\r\n-119 different color palettes let you customize the game\u2019s look and keep it fresh every time you play<br/>\r\n-and more! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay a little, or a lot -- there's no skill ceiling, so you can always get better and better. N++ is a game that has enough bite-sized gameplay to last you a lifetime.", "metacritic": 90, "released": "2015-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-20T09:20:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f9/6f9348edd93d9c25d6cc4ed2659703a6.jpg", "website": "http://www.nplusplus.org", "rating": 4.11, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 55, "owned": 886, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 60, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 139, "ratings_count": 121, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 122, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Metanet Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Metanet Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
