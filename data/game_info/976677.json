{"id": 976677, "slug": "dead-mire", "name": "Dead Mire", "name_original": "Dead Mire", "description": "Dead Mire is a unique atmospheric fast-paced endless wave zombie gore fest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ammo is scarce so you must use it tactically to dispose of as many zombies as you can with as few shots as possible. You are armed with a double barrel shotgun and you can switch between buckshot, birdshot and slugs which you must choose between wisely to maximize your damage output in any given situation.<br/><br/>Birdshot gives you a very wide cone but short range, ideal for taking out swarms of zombies grouping you. <br/>Slugs have long range and will pass through objects and other zombies but travels in a narrow line, best used when you line up zombies behind one another.<br/>Buckshot is a balance between range and width; your bread and butter for taking out zombies along with barrels and crates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Make use of portals and bullet time to extend and break up shots, killing more zombies in a single shot. Ammo and health potions spawn from broken barrels and crates which can also be destroyed with teleported shots, traps and dynamite, maximizing your ammo conservation.<br/><br/>Compete against other players on the Steam leaderboard to see who can kill the most zombies before they die or run out of ammunition!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T04:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e3bace4f522427962f64614a4c3380d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antares Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Antares Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
