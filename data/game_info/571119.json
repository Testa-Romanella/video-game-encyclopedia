I originally did so, by making a 31 minute Flash animated special, \"Fegelein turns Hitler &amp; the Bunker into a Flash Cartoon\", and I later saw that Unterganger \"FegeleinTheLostTapes\" made a Megaman inspired platformer based on the Downfall meme in Multimedia Fusion 2. Since I've always been a part of Clickteam game development, and wanted to go back to my roots, and also because unfortunately, the Hitler rants meme has been stagnant for years and I may retire soon, I want this to be my swan song.</p><p>In the mean time, I present to you, a three-level demo + music player/tutorial. (There may be bugs/glitches, and some gameplay may be flawed, but it's a work in progress, don't worry, I'm playtesting it constantly!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T08:13:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc5/fc50d83c57e50e65e861392b94a50aae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IngramJ/WonkyTonkBotty"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
