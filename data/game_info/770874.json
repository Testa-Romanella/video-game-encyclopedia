(gjs1025)", "description": "<p>This is my 3D Platformer Project.</p>\n<p>Modifications:</p>\n<p>1) I completed a complete interesting, comprehensive, and coherent level. I added levels 3, 4, and 5.</p>\n<p>2) I added multiple additional levels and tied them in to create a logical progression in my game. For example, in level 3 I added one ground chaser enemy, one ground shooter enemy, one skull prop, one robot light c prop, and one vent long prop. In level 4 I kept everything from level 3, but added one ground shooter enemy, one ground chaser enemy, one pillar with astrofloor on top, one lives pickup onto that new platform, and another space logo prop to the opposite wall. In level 5 I kept everything from level 4, but I changed platform A to be a moving platform, I added one tall pillar with astrofloor on top, one health pickup, one flying bot with waypoints enemy, one ground shooter enemy, and moved the existing health pickup onto the new platform.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*All of the enemies that I added were placed strategically in the player's route to make the game more challenging.*</p>\n<p>3) I modified the out of game menus in a few different ways. I changed the main menu UI backdrop color to red to match the red in the NASA logo. I also changed the font and color of the main menu buttons to create a cleaner look and to go along with the aesthetic of the game. Lastly, I changed the name of the game on the main menu to \"Space Race!\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>These are all design modifications.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by Grace Semaan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T15:23:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d7/1d71627c4b0bcf6ab56d52f5c434fbb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["gjs1025"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
