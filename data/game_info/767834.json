Mostly made over the weekend, I made most of the stuff but I have to credit a few things so those are at the bottom.</p>\n<p>In Mostly Accurate Flight Simulator (MAFS) you can fly a plane through a cool environment and crash, enjoying realistic physics-based crash disintegration and stuff. Flight is mostly realistic of course, don't mind a few things. Things like missions, scenarios, and more stuff in the map is coming soon so stay tuned. Have fun!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-simple...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/roadways/low-poly-road-pac...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-mini-village-free...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/cartoon-low-poly-cit...</p>\n<p>https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/exterior/cityscape/nuclear-power-plant-4...<br/></p>\n<p>and\u00a0https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49716989/unity-aircraft-physics\u00a0for the answer to my broken plane physics formula</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T03:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/6432ebf57efd5ee3f692f6a49f464a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ErroneousCreationist"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
