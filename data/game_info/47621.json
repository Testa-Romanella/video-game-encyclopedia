Or wished you could summon eldritch horror-terrors from the abyssal depths from whence we all came? Well here's your chance!<br/><br/>Underhand is a CCG (Cultist Card Game) that puts you into the role of a cult leader. Your job is to manage your cult's resources effectively as you respond to different event cards drawn from the deck. How you respond to these events will determine how far you'll go-- will you succeed in summoning one, or maybe even all of the Ancient Ones? Or will you be just another would-be upstart falling prey to the trials and tribulations of time? Only you can decide!<br/><br/>=========<br/><br/>THRILLING<br/><br/>Whether you're facing a treacherous obstacle or encountering an unexpected boon, every decision you make has tangible consequences manifesting as the current state of your hand. Underhand will have you on the edge of your seat as you walk the tightrope between having too many resources and not enough.<br/><br/>IMMERSIVE<br/><br/>With stunning, almost eerie visuals and sound, the stage is set for the perfect atmospheric experience. Every now and then, the in-game radio will react to your choices and broadcast the game-world's current state of affairs as affected by you, mastermind cult leader supreme-- all so you can keep up with the latest happenings and make more happenings... well, happen.<br/><br/>UNPARALLELED<br/><br/>Do you know any other games that let you run a cult? How about ones that also let you summon unfathomably monstrous deities? Or ones that let you do both of those packaged into one wholesome, sleek, mobile card game experience? Whatever else you want to say about Underhand, it's irrefutably the first of its kind. Play now, so you can proudly proclaim that you were into it well before it amassed a cult following!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13da389212715022bf69d1e0d329eb6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Apurv Sethi"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Apurv Sethi"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
