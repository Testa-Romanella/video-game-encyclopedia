Both Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets are supported.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDungeons are semi-procedurally generated for maximum performance. Utilizing randomly selected layouts players will be able to generate simple quests which will have them seeking to explore, slay, or collect items in dungeons featuring generated NPCs, loot, and traps. Players are able to increase or decrease the difficulty of these quests, and dungeon encounters will spawn an increased number of monsters based on the number of players in co-op sessions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5b/e5b9f3a29d7eda47cb498ed74f9a83ec.jpg", "website": "http://www.preventthefall.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 34, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 536, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["D.W.S"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["D.W.S."], "esrb_rating": null}
