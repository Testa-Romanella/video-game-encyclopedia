Develop your typing accuracy and speed while creating imaginative pixel art! PlaceType provides a chill and satisfying environment for players to type away while working towards their next masterpiece.<br/></p>\n<p>To play the game, head to the bottom of this page and download the .zip folder. Extract it and then launch PlaceType.exe.\u00a0 To view the open-source code, check out the GitHub page.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>When players start the game, they are greeted with the <em>Canvas</em>: a 10 x 10 grid of initially clear squares. On the left, players can also see their typing stats.</p>\n\n<p>Players can click on each individual tile to view the two different ways to fill it: via a Typing Mission or Purchase. Typing Missions earn points but pose a challenge, while purchasing spends points and unlocks the tile instantly.</p>\n<p>Typing Missions vary in length depending on which tile is selected. The further down and to the right the tile is, the more difficult the Typing Missions get. Players will need to improve their typing accuracy or cough up more points in order to fill the deeper tiles.</p>\n<p>Players successfully complete a Typing Mission by typing in every word without making a mistake. If the player types in an incorrect character or misses a space, the mission fails. However, players can quickly retry the mission by pressing R when prompted. Failing a mission does not negatively impact typing stats in any way.</p>\n<p>By raising their average typing speed, players can build a multiplier which increases their earnings. Use your points to recolour tiles and create fun art!</p>\r\nAttributions\r\n<p>Please note that the list of English words used to randomly generate typing missions is sourced from The Corncob List. I've done my best to try and remove all unsightly/offensive words from the list, but it is over 58,000 words long! If you see any of these words while playing, please help me out by contributing to the GitHub.</p>\n<p><em>The following are links to images and icons used in the UI of PlaceType.</em></p>\n<p>Refresh icons created by ghufronagustian - Flaticon</p>\n<p>Next icons created by Roundicons - Flaticon</p>\n<p>Cpu icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</p>\n<p>Shopping cart icons created by Kiranshastry - Flaticon</p>\n<p>Right icons created by Pixel perfect - Flaticon</p>\n<p>Bucket icons created by Those Icons - Flaticon</p>\n<p>Paint icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</p>\n<p>Play icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</p>\n<p>Close icons created by ariefstudio - Flaticon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T08:24:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cd870d80110c3c5822e024f40a74e2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustinLin905"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
