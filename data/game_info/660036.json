Move your mouse to aim, click to fire your next tile, and escape to free your cursor. Matching tiles without grounding them means they drop and raise your danger level.\u00a0But don't match 'em in the red danger zone without dropping, that's a game over!</p>\n<p>Made over about a month with Godot, using the Manrope font for all my text needs. This version's only half of what I wanted to do for the game, but it's all polished up and relatively bug free, ready to be continued later!</p>\n<p>Web version's up above and probably already on your screen for you to play whenever, but you can also download the game for Windows or Android below. Controls are mostly the same for touch screens, just swipe to aim and tap to fire.</p><p>Access to the\u00a0repository for the project, made with Godot 3.3.2, can be found on my Patreon for as little as $1 and a GitLab account. Or you can just come and gimme some money there anyway, if you're feeling generous!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T15:49:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc2c1f9f131cbdc1c6aa144acd22ef7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Moohemoth"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
