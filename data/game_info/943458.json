This is my first time building something substantial in Unity, so it will most likely be changed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pins have somehow come to life, and they are not happy with how gleefully you've been repeatedly knocking them down for decades. How will you defend yourself? With the only skill you have... and 12 pounds of urethane and resin. There's no ball return here, and whatever pins you don't knock down will still come after you...\u00a0Can you get through 10 frames?</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Move - Arrow Keys<br/>Bowl - Space<br/></p>\n<p>There is a bug where if you roll the ball while next to and\u00a0facing the wall, it could get stuck. I'm looking into how to fix this.</p><p>What's next for Pin King?<br/></p><p>Real Pathfinding: I plan on adding a real pathfinding script to the pins so they work better.<br/>More levels: I want the game to have harder levels, so it really is a score attack game<br/>Power-Ups: Get a strike? Right now you don't get anything from it, but that will change with some power-ups. Maybe even some penalties for a gutter ball!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-18T00:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e0be65a04f9975ddf23d2fb89443985.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TakaComics"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
