The game is based on the 1957 novel and the film of the same name. The game follows the storyline of the book and film, with adding in new scenes to make the game more action-oriented, as well as changing the affiliation of the main villains. Additionally, it features many elements of later Bond films to recreate the feel of the era such as the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964) and the jet pack from Thunderball (1965). From Russia with Love is also notable in that it is the first video game to use Sean Connery&#39;s younger likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor after twenty-two years away from the role. From Russia with Love is the last James Bond video game EA Games marketed before they lost the rights to Activision in 2006.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2005-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-03T02:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f54/f541dbdb05443ead67495235a2a5d60c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.63, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 17, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 9, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 447, "game_series_count": 21, "reviews_count": 30, "platforms": ["GameCube", "Xbox", "PSP", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Rebellion", "Visceral Games", "Electronic Arts Redwood Shores"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
