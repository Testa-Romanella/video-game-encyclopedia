A unique Tower Defense game which is set in the Continuation Wars. It was\u00a0developed in one week for the first Jam-Re Vival. Play as the Finnish soldiers, who are trying to protect their homeland. The unique twist: Every soldier has to be micro-managed to maximize efficiency! The normal infantryman may only be rotated, while the ski sniper moves along a line. Molotov Cocktail throwers may only throw when you command them to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T03:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abbe0f816b91b4fb76f982210f81c882.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RexLupie"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
