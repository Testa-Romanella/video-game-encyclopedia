Its inhabitants are Bizarre, and so is its reality. Enjoy this\u00a0 short adventure as you descend down into the depths of this damned place, using a series of switches to move forward and backwards through reality. This game will test your memory and platforming skills, as youll have to traverse both forward and backward through levels to progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Switches in the ON position will move you forward, Switches in the off position will take you backward, Use X to jump, and C to dash, as you attempt to make your way to the core and potentially, freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Note: While this is a whole experience, i also consider this a test if youd like to see this concept and game mechanic fleshed out. I kept the game brief so you can get a solid bite of what id do, were i to pursue this more, i hope you enjoy this little\u00a0\u00a0expierence.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T06:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c081028eede653d2de8571eeacbf3740.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ALLIE CAT GAMES"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
