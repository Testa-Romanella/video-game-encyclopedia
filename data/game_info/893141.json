You, as an archaeologist, have arrived on site to explore this ancient tomb. Things are not what they seem however, as the entrance slams shut, trapping you inside. Civilization is miles away. Being stuck down here for who knows how long, you might as well take a look around. After all, there must be a mechanism to open the door again, right? Who knows what else you\u2019ll find, or what will find you? Will you solve the mystery before it\u2019s too late, and escape with your life? Or will you find yourself <strong>ENTOMBED.<br/></strong></p>\n\r\nWhat To Expect\r\n<p>Expect a challenging atmospheric puzzle game that is intentionally claustrophobic and disorienting.\u00a0You're not alone, so make good use of the many tunnels, walls, and nooks you can hide in. Whatever you do, don't stop moving.<br/></p>\n<p>This project is made using Godot 4 beta 8, which is not yet in a stable release. As such, you might encounter some bugs. If you do, please let me know! I will update the game after any beta releases that fix reported bugs, as well as when the final 4.0 version is released.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Entombed is a first person game, that uses the mouse to look around and the WASD keys to move. To interact with puzzle elements, look at the item and click with the left mouse button. Additionally, you may press and hold the shift key to sprint.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a controller may be used, with the following controls:</p>\n<p>Left stick - Move</p>\n<p>Right stick - Look</p>\n<p>D-Pad - Navigate through UI / Turn book pages</p>\n<p>Bottom action button (Xbox A) - Interact / Accept</p>\n<p>Right action button (Xbox B) - Pause / Cancel</p>\n<p>Left action button (Xbox X) - Sprint<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T05:23:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/044/04450c90b235bb73579b9258bc8702b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["manchmalscott"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
