Like a Choose Your Own Adventure, each panel of this RPG gamebook poses you choices that move the story forward. Create your fate by choosing your own path through the doomsday simulation -- the choices you make will unlock new paths in your quest for survival -- that is, if they don\u2019t leave you dead in the chemical wasteland. Your selection of skills, the items you scavenge, and the survivors you bring will unlock possibilities and set you racing to survive the apocalyptic doomsday mayhem! \u2028\u2028<br/><br/>The base version of the game contains the original black and white background art, a gruelling life regeneration timer, and banner ads. The pro upgrade removes timers, banners, and unlocks color background art for every single panel of the story. <br/><br/>&amp;quot;A lot of unique flavor from the get-go&amp;quot; <br/>-TouchArcade\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>&amp;quot;The writing in This Is Not A Test stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the art.&amp;quot; <br/>-TouchArcade\u2028\u2028<br/><br/>A gamebook by definition, This Is Not a Test mixes RPG elements with a Choose Your Own Adventure styled graphic novel. Choosing skills, scavenging items, and bringing companions will affect your quest for survival. All scenes and all of the user-interface is hand-illustrated by amazing comic artist Jeff Edwards, in a gritty, apocalyptic style. The writing is blunt, pulpy, and cruel, hurling you into the skin of a victim racing for survival in the mayhem of the final moments of humanity. As a gamebook, it is shorter and punchier than its long-winded rivals, with a focus on the amazing art. As graphic novel RPG, its mechanics are streamlined, and won\u2019t have you drowning in numbers. As a survival game, it pushes you ruthlessly toward your eventual demise in the death gas \u2014 unless you do something about it. \u2028\u2028<br/><br/>Explosions are heard in the distant skies and a terrible death gas looms over the population.
