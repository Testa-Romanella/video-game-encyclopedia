To facilitate the creation of this huge body of water in Derbyshire\u2019s Hope Valley, two villages in the reservoir\u2019s basin were evacuated. The inhabitants of Derwent and Ashopton were displaced to other local towns, or the nearby city of Sheffield.\u00a0<br/><br/>Anything valuable or reusable was pulled out, but the buildings, the skeleton of the town, remain under the water to this day. I visited the area with the goal of finding the location of sunken Derwent. Despite the area being one of the most popular hiking sites in the UK, it is surprisingly difficult to pinpoint where the town actually was. By following historical accounts, faded photographs, and the stories of local inhabitants, I followed the reservoir to the point where I believed Derwent to be.\u00a0<br/><br/>The reservoir has become a spectacular \u2018natural\u2019 attraction, though manmade, and the village was reclaimed by nature, though by human interaction. The buildings still exist, and the residents went on to live lives elsewhere, but the village itself has become the smallest footnote in the occasional walking guide. By embarking on this project I wanted to explore that space between memory and progress, where loss shifts between being a physical thing and an internal yearning.<br/></p>\n<p>\u25bc<br/></p>\n<p><em>Huge thanks to the residents of Bamford who met with me to discuss the area, especially Kath Hearnshaw, Chair of the Bamford Historical Society, and Don, who I really met in the churchyard entirely by chance that day.\u00a0<br/><br/>The two folk songs present in the game are called \u2018The Derbyshire Miller\u2019 and \u2018The Derby Ram\u2019.
