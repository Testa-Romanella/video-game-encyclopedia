(I wrote that with less than five minutes left)</p>\n\n<p>The file on this page is unfinished so please don't waste your time on it.<br/></p>\n\n<p>So... Hey.</p>\n<p>I Just learned that you can't put a \"?\" on a name. That was the problem. I'm not even mad that I couldn't publish it because I learned a lot during this week and everything is an experience.<br/></p>\n<p>If you want to play the game anyway you can find it here: https://cisnerosshanti.itch.io/were-you-ever-free-gj</p>\n\n<p>I uploaded just as it was yesterday at 10. I didn't even fix the small mistakes and the music is still broken. Such a shame.<br/></p>\n\n<p>///---Details about the game that nobody cares.---\\\\\\<br/></p>\n<p>I had a lot of problems with this project but I'm happy with what I got. Originally I was just the artist teamed up with 3 programmers and a great\u00a0musician, but 2 of them never answered on our discord. Halfway\u00a0 through I tried to change our game engine because I wasn't happy with it so the other programmer left. I had to do everything but the music.</p>\n<p>I started to learn how to make games 3 weeks before the jam so this is my FIRST GAME EVER. <br/></p>\n<p>I'm really happy I did it on time and maybe I won't win anything but I wasn't trying to. If someone else enjoys the game I'll be satisfied.</p>\n<p>You can follow our great musician on twitter: https://twitter.com/Shakekonigiri<br/></p>\n<p>You can follow me to know my next projects: https://twitter.com/cisneros_shanti</p>\n\n<p> THANKS<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>I'll see you on the next jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:43:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5a36c20a8c9ab89067e7e9796ade3fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cisnerosshanti"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
