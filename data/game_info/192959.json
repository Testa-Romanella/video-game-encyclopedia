The players take on the role of a tester for a high profile spacecraft company. To test their newest spaceship prototypes, the company hires these testers to race against each other so they can gather data. As incentive, the winner of the race is allowed to keep the prototype. Throughout the race, the player faces many different obstacles such as roaming asteroids, walls of lasers, and other players. Bongo Blast-Off offers geometric neon shapes and on dark backgrounds, emphasizing vector graphics. Because of the bright neon vectors held on darkened backgrounds, this helps to pop the bright flourish colors and guides the user\u2019s eye throughout the space scenes. Bongo Blast-Off is created in Unity and programmed in C#. It is played with the Nintendo DK Bongos as their main controllers.</p>\n<p>READ HOW TO PLAY</p>\n<p>KEYBOARD CONTROLS: </p>\n<p>Player 1: A / D for left and right thrust, Q / E for brakes<br/>Player 2: J / L for left and right thrust, U / O for brakes</p>\n<p>Escape to return to menu once in race</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p><strong>Producer:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Michael-Paul Ho-Kang-You</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Jimmy Griffths</p>\n<p><strong>Artist:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Kaylee Sharp</p>\n<p><strong>Designers:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Max Johnson</p>\n<p>Spencer Whiteway</p>\n<p>Zach Phillips</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d7/4d7596396457684b26af6fc1cac0bfc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZPhillipsGames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
