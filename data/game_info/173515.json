{"id": 173515, "slug": "monster-defense", "name": "Monster Defense", "name_original": "Monster Defense", "description": "<p>This game was made for the Ludum Dare 33 !</p><p>You are the leader of a monster pack and you send your minions to kill humans. However, the more you kill heroes, the better they are ! Fortunately, your powers increase too. Will you be strong enough to defeat the best hero ?</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>For this game (which is my first one), I chose to use libgdx with scala. I had to adapt some things but it worked perfectly well. I just had problems with errors messages which was sometime wrong : they did not show the real mistakes.</p><p>I began by the physics of the game. Basically, you control an army of monster that you can use against a hero. This hero has a spear. When a monster touch the spear, it dies. If he touch the hero, the hero dies. When you do not have any monster left, you become the boss. When you killed a hero, both the stats of the next heroes and your stats increased. So, the last fight depends on what your army did before.</p><p>The game is a simple platform game. The background and the ground are scrolling. The characters can lay down, jump and move.</p><p>Once I had a basic game, I became the graphic part. I did pixel art characters. I did the animations, the background, text messages...</p><p>Next, I integrated it to my game. I added screens, I animated my squares and made the background and the ground scroll.</p><p>I did a basic \"AI\" based on if else for the hero when he fights against the boss. I did not wanted to do something hard.</p><p>Then, I did the sounds. The background sound is a simple loop played by a bass, a kick and a french horn. I tried to do a \"dark knight\" melody, a dark melody. I generated other sounds for the jumps, the hits...</p><p>I did four levels that can be solved by different ways. They are quite short.</p><p>For the control, the space key is used to jump, the directional keys to move, m to mute and 1, 2, 3 and 4 and launch monster. You can also click on the monster to launch. I had problems when resizing my window : all clickable area became impossible to click.</p><p>Finally, this game jam was a very nice experience. I learnt to use libgdx two days ago and it was a good way to practice. I will do it again :)</p><p>See you, </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e4/5e4ed01a024a755debff41714a7f384f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aun"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
