It is about this fear of the dark we have all known and that some of you may still encounter today.<br/><br/>You play a child waking up in her/his bedroom, plunged in absolute darkness. No luck, it's impossible to get back to sleep.<br/><br/>Through the eyes of this child and her/his imagination, what should be a simple, but slightly scary walk through the house might quickly turn into a nightmare.\r\n</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The principle is simple : You move in the dark and you can only see what is around you when the game is paused. Be aware, it's not a platformer with holes to be avoided everywhere. You'll need to observe, memorize and think in order to resolve simple puzzles.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game is made with a passion for 2D immersive games, with a lot of sounds recorded in studio and not that many hours of sleep. It is a narrative, but short adventure (approximately 10-20 minutes + an alternate ending), so take your time and enjoy !</p>\n\n\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p><strong>Arrow keys</strong> to move<br/><strong>Spacebar</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong> to interact<br/><strong>F</strong> to Pause (And believe me, you'll need it)</p>\n<p>You can play in browser or download the Windows version of the game. <br/>The versions are the same. It only depends of your preferences !<br/><br/></p>\n\n<br/>Credits\r\n<p>A game by <em>Khamelot</em></p>\n<p>Inspired by <em>Pippin Barr game ideas </em><br/>\"You spend all your time on pause because you're too scared to play\"<br/></p>\n<p>Originally developed during a 3-day Game Jam</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to</p>\n<p><em>Manon Molinier<br/></em><em>Victor Goya<br/></em><em> Todd</em><em><br/>Malink</em><em><br/>Deltvar</em><em><br/>Toakirta</em></p>\n<p>For making this game possible</p>\n<p>Also thanks <em>to my love, family and friends</em> for their support</p>\n<p>And thank you for playing !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/985/985f392fa15ea773b9582bd4b281a8a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Khamelot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
