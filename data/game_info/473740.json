The theme of the Jam was lost and this game is all about lost information which you have to piece together.\u00a0 The competition features a 'duck' category.\u00a0You can find the 'duck' in the fourth audio call. A duck is a British cricket term for no rounds (or points) scored when batting.</p>\n<p>The game should run at around 15 minutes. I cannot stress enough, please do not guess. All the answers are there if you listen and look closely. If you are not a native English speaker, you may want to Google a few things also.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art, Code, Music - Tim Sheinman (Owl_Skip)</p>\n<p>Voice Work - Larry Rickard, John Doy, Tim Sheinman]</p>\n<p>Notes</p>\n<p>This game is obviously enormously inspired by the work of John LeCarre and Graham Greene. If you enjoyed it, I suggest you seek out their novels and adapatations for TV and Screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T03:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bda/bda73eb364a21a3eff5f7164d4a8ccfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Owl_Skip"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
