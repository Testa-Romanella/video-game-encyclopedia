Well, this is it. To be a little more interesting it features a map consisting of 25 000 000 square meters of forests, beaches and mountains. Oh, and by the way, it's not even just a shitty shooter, it's primary game mode is a hunger games mode, you've heard it before, I don't even need to explain what it is. Everything goes back and forth over the internet off course, so that you can team up with you very best friend. Heck, you can even build bases with your friend!</p><p>This, however is a really early stage of the game, it doesn't even have a server browser yet. It just puts you in a random room, but hey, you should be fine.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>wasd - move (you should've figured that out by now)</p><p>e - pick up / put down object</p><p>q - open sack</p><p>h - start the game (if you're the host (you're the host if the circle in the top left corner of your screen is green (that even rhymed!)))</p><p>m - map (if you have one)</p><p>1, 2 - weapons (if you have them)</p><p>mouse 1 - shoot</p><p>mouse 2 - zoom (if you have a scope on your weapon)</p><p>shift - sprint</p><p>tab - score</p><p>esc - menu</p><p>r - reload<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc3/bc30c2aafaecd0c4504a242fe7f2c993.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["totte"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
