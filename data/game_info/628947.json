I'm quite proud of it, and I\u00a0hope you have a fun time playing it!<br/><br/>Huge shout-outs to <em>Insandio </em>for composing me another absolute banger for a soundtrack for this game, as well as <em>Extranji</em>, for playtesting and finding approximately a hundred thousand bugs.<br/><br/>==SPOILER==<br/>The final screen of the game mentions that there are 13 hidden collectables, but there are actually only 9. Apparently I\u00a0forgot how to count when I was making the final screen lmao<br/><br/>Attribution:<br/>I used a wonderful sound effects pack that I found on OpenGameArt for some of the sound effects in the game (the ones I didn't create myself.)<br/>You can find the creator (Little Robot Sound Factory) here:\u00a0www.littlerobotsoundfactory.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T10:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e0/6e0c1e2e1cffb85bccf6b1db416cce88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shovel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
