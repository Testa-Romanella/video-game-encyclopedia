It's about shooting presents, trying different weapons and finding santa.</p><p>I was asked how I implemented the weapon system, so I uploaded all the scripts used in the project for everyone who is interesed. Feel free to learn from them and to repurpose them for your own projects. If you do, I'd be glad if you put my name in your credits, but only if you want.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/518fd41f55c8132df126cbff9b611afb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JanRiebe"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
