If you have a Computer with a Keyboard and/or a USB controller, download it for free and give it a try. It's kind of an arcade 2d shooter multiplayer retro platformer where you fight a big boss which has two forms and many attacks. There are many other features to discover and enjoy. Please let me know if you give it a go, complete it, get a good score or encounter any bugs. Feedback is appreciated. GLHF!
