Most of the country is uncivilized, a chain of city-states, yet the isles on the other side of the sea have been colonized. Socrate's great-great-grandfather is not born yet, but art is flourishing and the Odyssey a scholar classic. Many conceptions about Ancient Greece are already true, but much more are not, for the best and the worst.</p><p><strong>Melos</strong> is a short interactive story (around 10,000 words for 6 endings) about romance, poetry and honesty in this world at the meeting point between myth and history.</p><p>Art by Katta.
