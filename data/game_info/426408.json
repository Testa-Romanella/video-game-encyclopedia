Armed with only a recent promotion and the begrudging support of your enigmatic boss, Tahira, it's up to you to decide what to do with Siruud the Devourer.</p>\n<p>Keep your head above water as you try to break your bind with a dangerous archdemon, either pursuing the perfectionist Tahira who harbours a deep and secret resentment for your demon, or by abandoning everything you know to help Siruud understand what happened the night he was arrested.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>General Note: PLEASE properly set your name by typing the name into the box and hitting confirm. I'm trying and failing currently to figure out how to set a \"default\" name but until then if you don't do so, your name will be 0.</p>\n<p>Also, this is the very first \"draft\" of Bad Ritual transitioned into Twine. There may be errors: please let me know of them! The best way is to give me some context: where in the story you were, what option you picked, maybe complete phrases from the glitching passage. I appreciate your help catching oopsies at this time.</p><p>The original version of the game is automatically playable in browser from the itch interface, but unfortunately there's no way for me to have two playable files. The Lite version, which has a lighter colour scheme with higher contrast for easier viewing, can be downloaded and merely clicked on to launch in the browser.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T03:19:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6af/6af8d0d108794c100a01f7a0967cb4e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HeartForge"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
