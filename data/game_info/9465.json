In a war-torn world of Cairn, humanity is close to extinction. Cairn became a battleground for two extra-terrestrial forces - the Aetherials and Chthonians. Both of which are eager to completely wipe out humanity for different reasons. The game tells us a story of several humans that try to adapt and survive the harsh times.</p>\n<p>Like in most Action RPGs, the main focus of the game is put on battling the enemies and gathering loot - armor, potions, weapons, and gold. Grim Dawn features a crafting system that is similar to the one in a popular mod DoTA. The developers put a strong emphasis on the enhanced physics in the game, environmental kills, enemies dismemberment and a totally new mission system. </p>\n<p>The players are free to choose one of eight classes present in the game. Several factions are also featured. As the plot progresses, the player will have to choose which factions to join. Joining one faction will make the opposing one hostile to the protagonist.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2016-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T03:44:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/920/92039cd19460532b76f6244b2bb3e4ac.jpg", "website": "http://www.grimdawn.com/", "rating": 3.97, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 177, "owned": 2864, "beaten": 256, "toplay": 86, "dropped": 228, "playing": 70}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 158, "ratings_count": 561, "suggestions_count": 583, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 566, "platforms": ["Xbox Series S/X", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Crate Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crate Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
