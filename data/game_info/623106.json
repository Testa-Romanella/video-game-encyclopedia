She can attack with it when it is equipped and can be thrown to aid her as a platform. She cannot attack while the weapon is thrown, as she needs to recall and re-equip it first to do so.</p>\n\n<p>There is a bug in C-1's system that poorly detects that the scythe has been thrown, but cannot be recalled. This can be prevented by her SYSTEM RESET function, allowing a function boot to read correctly.</p>\n\n<p>C-1 is a very delicate android, please do not let her near acidic liquids nor spikes to avoid damage.</p>\n<p>C-1 is a product of ALS Tech 2021</p>\n<p>In order to experience C-1's full potential, ALS Tech has given her various upgrades in the for of LORE CARDS.
