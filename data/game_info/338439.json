This FREE to download favorite is not only easy and addictive to play, it\u2019s also one of the best card games to download for no wifi play. We took the original Klondike (or patience solitaire) game that you grew up playing on Windows Solitaire, but optimized it for today\u2019s mobile devices. Now you can enjoy an easy to play, and even easier to love, version of solitaire classic for iPad or iPhone.<br/><br/>Choose your favorite traditional Solitaire gameplay style with either one (1) card draw, or three (3) card draw. You can use the vintage method of click and drag to move the cards from one place to another, or utilize the built in, handy one tap feature for much easier, faster gameplay both with and without wifi!<br/> <br/>If you get stuck during a game, then watch a quick video for a simple hint to get you over a bump in the road. Or if the round is creeping closer to a dead end and you need a little extra help reaching the finish line, we built in an available game feature which uncovers a card that you couldn\u2019t quite get to on your own, in order to keep the hand alive. <br/><br/>Some of the features included with your free download of Solitaire Infinite include:<br/><br/>- Unlimited free \u201cundos\u201d for any of the solitaire game modes. Yes, even all the way back to the beginning of the hand!<br/><br/>- \u2018Retry Game!\u2019 feature, which allows you to restart and replay the current card game. We found that sometimes users needed a second shot at a particular round of solitaire for various reasons, so you now have that option! Whether it\u2019s hunt for a faster solution to beat the clock, increase your score, or maybe deploy a different approach to a game that you were stuck on - no matter what your reason, we feel that second chances in life shouldn\u2019t cost you!<br/><br/>- No internet connection needed! Solitaire Infinite is one of the best free card games for both no wifi and/or limited wifi. Play any time, play anywhere.<br/><br/>- Both regular hints, and special hidden card hints are available! Watch a quick video to enjoy the regular hints you\u2019re used to, which give you a nudge in the right direction. Or if you need a little stronger help when you\u2019re completely stuck, watch a video and uncover a useful hidden card from deep in the stack!<br/><br/>- This free card app is optimized for all mobile devices including both iPhone and iPad.<br/><br/>- Solitaire Infinite also features a delayed start timer, so the clock doesn\u2019t start running until you\u2019re ready to play. This allows you to take your time reviewing the hand of cards you were dealt without penalty, and formulate the best strategy to start the hand on the right foot. <br/><br/>- Tracks top scores and their dates! There\u2019s always a bar to raise, somewhere - so we track that for you.<br/><br/>- Attractive, uncluttered card game design that was engineered to fit today\u2019s modern devices and playing styles.<br/><br/>- Auto-complete for \u201csolved\u201d games that just need to have the cards stacked.
