Drop kick the crap out of everything (ie two objects I placed).</strong></p>Controls:P1 <p>Run: A/D <br/>Jump: Hold L.CTRL <br/>Kick: Release jump. </p>P2<p>Run: J/L <br/>Jump: Hold R.ALT<br/>Kick: Release jump.</p><p>Press R to reset. <em>That's it.</em><br/></p>Information:<p>There's barely <em>anything</em> to see here, but I had two goals for 2016:<br/></p><ol><li>To participate in my first Game Jam, and;</li><li>To put my first piece of work online, no matter good or bad it is.</li></ol><p>My vision is a local multiplayer beat 'em up, similar to Samurai Gunn, Smash Bros, Towerfall etc. It could also incorporate side scrolling co-op quite easily too. Deeper, advanced movement mechanics were also planned but I either didn't know how to implement them, or they were ripped out because they didn't work properly at the time of the Jam finishing.<br/></p><p>My obvious lack of programming skills prevented a lot of what I wanted to achieve but nonetheless I learnt a <em>lot, </em>pushed out of my comfort zone and got further than I expected. I'll continue working on this.<br/></p>Update notes:<br/><ol><li><strong>Multiplayer added</strong>. Now you can kick a friend and <em>still </em>not have fun!</li><li><strong>Level redesigned. </strong>Might be better for jumping around in.</li><li><strong>Camera shake broken. </strong>Yep, no idea why. Still looking into this.</li><li><strong>Controls on screen. </strong>Should make it easier for all of you streamers to understand what you should be pressing before you quit due to lack of any satisfying gameplay.</li><li><strong>Drastically reduced bloat. </strong>Deleted .pbd files. Hopefully the game still runs for you. Let me know if it doesn't. I've got no clue what I'm doing!</li></ol>Disclaimer:<p><em>Sorry about the thumbnail being more exciting than the actual \"game\". <br/>Game assets by \"Asset Jesus\" Kenney</em><em>.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b2/4b264056a44216a43290656155723ab8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
