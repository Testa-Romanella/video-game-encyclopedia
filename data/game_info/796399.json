You primarily have two seconds to get onto and to get off of the red and blue platforms as they bounce back and forth from being platforms which you can stand on, and platforms which will kill you, as you try to reach the golden blocks to beat the level.</p>\n<p>Don't lose your focus, don't lose your patience. Rushing is a sure-fire way to death and frustration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T12:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/6609fbfe146d071ad01bb3ed50e03952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["James Butler"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
