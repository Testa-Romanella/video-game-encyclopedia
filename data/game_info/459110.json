Unfortunately I didn't get that far.\u00a0 As per the jam, there are only ever 2 colors on the screen at one time.</p>\n<p>Fully playable in English and Spanish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T08:11:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c73cc50c97052b0bd877770acfbbe3ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VVill"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
