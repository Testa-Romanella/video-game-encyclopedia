This was one of my earliest full 3D games, and I took a lot of inspiration from JazzPunk and Thirty Flights of Loving.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was originally deployed to the Unity Web Player, which is no longer supported by modern browsers. It was intended to be played in a web page, so there might be bugs in this standalone version. The control scheme is a bit... unusual, but I think that was intentional for the conceit I was trying for.</p>\n<p><em>Charged with a Mission</em>\u00a0was made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 32 \"An Unconventional Weapon\".\u00a0See its jam page here\u00a0(Web version link does not work!)</p>\n<p><em>Charged with a Mission</em>\u00a0was made using Unity3D.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:54:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/186/186275006dfd3b5f5cf0605de5751e3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["incobalt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
