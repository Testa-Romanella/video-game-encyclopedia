If you have a copy of the old demo, please understand that it is very outdated and the final release of the game will look much better as all character art, background art, and UI has been updated. The final game will also let you choose Kuro and the protagonist's gender, allowing for GxB, BxG, GxG and BxB gameplay. (The demo only had GxB)</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to read a more detailed and better presented version of this description, please head to my page here:</strong>\u00a0https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43&amp;t=48983</p>\n<p>Hey everyone, welcome to my page for my free\u00a0 visual novel, Solipsism Reigns.</p>\n<p>This project was almost abandoned because I just didn't have the time or inspiration to work on it... however, thanks to an appropriately themed Tyranobuilder Jam, the project is alive once again!</p>\n<p>In the game you play as the protagonist (who is nameable) and must travel through many different worlds with your yandere spirit companion, Kuro, in order to seek the truth of your situation. Kuro's gender can be chosen by the player, but for the sake of ease I will refer to him as being male for the rest of the description.</p>\n<p>Male Kuro is fully voiced in English by Timothy Smith. My aim is to have every character voiced fully in the final release. You can romance Kuro but beware, he has yandere tendencies. He's perfectly capable of being kind and loving, he's protective but also lets you fight your own battles, however, his jealousy can be a serious problem... Once that switch is flipped he becomes murderously possessive.</p>\n<p>There are many bad endings, but they don't mean game over, in fact, the more endings you view, the more of the truth you will uncover! While the game is unlikely to contain\u00a018 rated material or overly sexual content, it will include graphic descriptions of violence and some scenes of non-consensual kissing. So please don't play this if that sort of thing upsets you, as the last thing I want to do is hurt anyone. The final version will also include some violent CGs.</p>\n<p>There are multiple choices in each of the routes but the game is designed to be fairly easy to play, without the need for a complicated walk through.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It has been brought to my attention that I didn't really mention much in terms of plot, haha. I can't say too much without spoiling certain things in the game, but I can give a brief description of each of the routes (which are playable in any order you choose) :3</p>\n<p>In the Student route, you must navigate the perils of beginning college. In an environment where you hope to make new friends you should tread extra carefully so as not to upset Kuro.</p>\n<p>In the Mage route, you are the latest addition to a guild of qualified magic users. Sworn to use your abilities for good you must end up facing a threat that could wipe out all life as you know it.</p>\n<p>In the Clan Leader route, you are tasked with navigating various political dilemmas in order to lead your clan to victory and peace.</p>\n<p>In the Detective route, a supernatural serial killer from your past returns to walk the land of the living, intent on finishing what he started when you were a child.</p>\n<p>In the Gamer route, you will need to decide what is more important between the digital world and the real world as both dimensions begin to merge with one another.</p>\n<p>An unlockable\u00a0Hidden route will become available to play through once certain conditions within the other routes have been met.</p>\n<p>The final version is a long way off (I'm aiming for Summer/Autumn 2018) because this is a solo project that I'm working on in my free time (I'm a full time carer.) I am, however, making very good progress. All text is in game and so the story itself is playable from start to finish right now, all background art and BGM is in place as well. I still need to add character art, SFX, video stuff, and the remaining voice lines. After that I will begin testing.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all the artists out there who let people like me use their assets for free projects, the\u00a0 first demo\u00a0wouldn't have been possible without you all! &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13b/13bc69d8c421e142d63be1cb0962d52b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["IkariKali"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
