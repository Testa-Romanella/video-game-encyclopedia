{"id": 53906, "slug": "uridium", "name": "Uridium", "name_original": "Uridium", "description": "<p>Uridium is a science fiction side-scrolling shoot 'em up originally designed by Andrew Braybrook for the Commodore 64, and later ported to other 8-bit machines. It consists of fifteen levels, each named after a metal element, with the last level being called Uridium (a fictional metallic element, not to be confused with the real metallic element iridium). The manual quotes Robert Orchard, who invented the name as saying \"I really thought it existed.\" </p>\n<p>Uridium was later released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. Mindscape purchased a license to release a game based on the film The Last Starfighter. Rather than program a new game, however, Mindscape decided to take an easier route by recycling an older, relatively obscure game. The title screen, sprites, and soundtrack were modified, but the levels and gameplay were identical. In 2003, it was re-released on the C64 Direct-to-TV.</p>\n<p>In 2008, the C64 version was announced as a title on the Wii Virtual Console. On 28 March 2008, Uridium was released for the Virtual Console in Europe, costing 500 Wii Points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4c819ce766472cd2c2745d497e5d6c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "iOS", "Atari ST", "Wii", "NES", "PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Braybrook"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Hewson Consultants"], "esrb_rating": null}
