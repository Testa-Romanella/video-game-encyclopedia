There is a number on the lower right corner of the card that indicates the amount of damage this card can deal out. However, unlike other card games, having the higher number will not guarantee you a winning round.</p>\r\n Card Modes \r\n<p> Bellow the card, there are three buttons.</p>\n\n<p>Each button represents a mode this card can be placed in. To select a mode for the card, simply click the button.</p>\n<p> Each mode is able to defeat exactly one other mode. Defense mode will always defeat attack mode. Attack mode will always beat support mode. Support mode will always defeat defense mode.</p>\n\r\nDamage\r\n<p>Once you and your opponent have made your mode selection, the cards and mode choices will be revealed and the winner will be determined. The amount of damage listed on the winner's card will be dealt to the loser. You start with 20 hit points and the game is over once someone hits zero.</p>\r\nSpecial Effects\r\n<p>Some cards have special effects listed on them. These effects are triggered only one certain conditions are met.</p>\n\n<p>Using the card above as an example, Artillery has a special effect that triggers when you lose with this card played in support mode (On support mode lose). There are a handful of cards with special effects, so be sure to watch out for them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:28:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b18/b18be7c3ac2482cae42bbed9d4877f8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryan Soulard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
