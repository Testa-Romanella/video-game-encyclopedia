{"id": 129551, "slug": "latchbow", "name": "LATCHBOW", "name_original": "LATCHBOW", "description": "LATCHBOW:\r\n<p>A twin-stick arena shooter where you control a character who wields a Latchbow. \u00a0You fire magical grappling hooks out of your bow, quickly pulling enemies to you. \u00a0Once they're in your grasp, use them as a meat shield or hurl them back at other enemies for big damage!\u00a0</p>\n\n<strong>CONTROLS:</strong>\n<p>WASD - Movement<br/><strong>Tap </strong>Left Mouse Button - Knockback Blast<br/><strong>Hold </strong>Left Mouse Button - Charge to shoot a grappling arrow<br/>Right Mouse Button - Dodge<br/>Both Mouse Buttons at the same time - Execute (while holding an enemy)<br/>As mentioned below, there are plenty of other actions using these buttons. \u00a0We encourage experimentation.</p>\n\n<strong>GMTKJAM:</strong>\n<p>This game was made for the 'Game Maker's Toolkit Jam' in 48 hours. \u00a0We took inspiration from the Jam's 'Downwell' video along with the GMTK episode on 'Versatile Verbs' as the two videos went hand-in-hand. \u00a0You control a character with a versatile, intuitive moveset which is filled with options. \u00a0Every situation presents multiple options to maximize player expression. \u00a0While holding an enemy, you can use them as a shield, use them as a weapon, use them for mobility (vaulting off of them), or execute them to restore your health. \u00a0You can dash really far or really short. \u00a0You can shoot a grappling hook, or can shoot a projectile with knockback (to hit enemies into each other), or use a quick short range knockback. \u00a0Every button performs multiple actions and each mechanic affects the game state in multiple ways.</p>\n\n<strong>DESIGN:</strong>\n<p>While the game has a plethora of options, we hoped to make it intuitive by designating certain buttons to certain actions. \u00a0Left click is always an aggressive option, right click is always a defensive option, and pressing both (while holding an enemy) results in an instant-killing execute that heals the player (both aggressive and defensive). \u00a0</p>\n\n<strong>FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:</strong>\n<p>We hope to expand on this game in the future to have levels, a variety of enemies, and some type of progression. \u00a0For the purposes of the jam, we focused on creating our versatile, intuitive, and elegant player character.</p>\n\n<strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n<p><strong>David Allen</strong> - Music, Sound Effects, Design<br/><strong>Henry Wheeler</strong>-<strong>Mackta</strong> - Programming, Design, Sprites<br/><strong>Josh Mace</strong> - Sprites</p>\n<p>All music is original<br/>All art is original<br/>All code is original<br/>All sound effects are either original or modified versions of sounds from the '<strong>Sound Ideas</strong>' effects library</p>\n<p>Built in <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> 4.16<br/></p>\n<p>Follow David on Twitter: @fraudSound<br/>Follow Henry on Twitter: @Whackta</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/dee51de197566ec93b300d2741699e77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Allen", "Whackta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
