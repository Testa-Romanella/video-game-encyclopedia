You play as Sunnie, a floating... sun with... uh.. hydraulic spikes. Anyways! Sunnie decided one day to explore an abandoned factory near the outskirts of town, for clout. To her surprise, it's not actually abandoned, a simple 180 and done! Out of the Factory! Except you wandered too deep into the factory. And worse, a series of heavy titanium doors shut behind you(With nuke symbols on them despite this factory doesn't even have any nuclear or radioactive crap in it)!! Luckily there is a bounty of keys with in each room! Find the keys. Unlock the doors. Get the keck out! It's just that simple! Let's just hope there aren't any Eldritch Monstrosities Beyond Sanity in there, ha ha! (Also please let me know of any problems with the game, I do plan to expand it a bit in the very close future!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:59:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2fae39a22508464e890e8da42c790ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChowderWare Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
