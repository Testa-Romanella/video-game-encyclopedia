The catch is that the invaders are invisible except for the short time when\u00a0they are scanned by you, in a manner\u00a0reminiscent of a submarines sonar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a remake of a prior game that I made for a different game jam, linked here:\u00a0https://noahshomette.itch.io/space-defender.</p>\n<p>The first game was made in Unity using C#. I created this new version in Bevy using Rust.\u00a0</p><p>Source code available here:</p><p>https://github.com/NoahShomette/space_commander_gam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T08:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d7/2d74c9ccbd5b276d794086f32f98a8e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NoahShomette"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
