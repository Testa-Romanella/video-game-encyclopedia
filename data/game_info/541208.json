Or put them in your mouth to eat them, so you can heal and become bigger.</p>\r\n\u00a0How to play:\r\n<p>Eat cells to grow: you need to eat 10 cells to grow, by growing you can challenge bigger baddies and smaller ones will fear you.<br/></p><p>There are building blocks near you when you spawn. You can go near them or use your mouse to attach them to your own body. Your main block/cell is your heart, if a projectile hits it, you instantly die (so protect it), the same applies for the enemies. <br/></p>\n<p>You can press spacebar to shoot projectiles if you have a turret cell. \u00a0The enemy can destroy parts of your body, if a block/cell gets destroyed so does everything that is attached to it. <br/></p>\n<p>Be careful of the enemy's projectiles, they can destroy your offensive cells and make you defenseless as a vegetable. Adding blocks/cells can affest your health, speed, rotation or make you a force to be reckoned with.<br/></p>\r\nChanges for CellsNew:\r\n<ul><li>Changed size of two enemies to be bigger(the enemies were the same size as weaker enemies, accidentally. Was changed to not cause confusion)</li><li>Added 3 small items, ran out of time to add them.</li><li>Added mouth item( since you can only grow if you eat, you would be stuck if you didn't have a mouth. Otherwise you would have to hope a enemy drops one).</li><li>Added simple instructions at spawn.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Of course you should rather play the newer version but its near identical.</p>\n<p> If you play the original submission, you should remember that the largest enemy is the same size as the second largest, but you won't be able to attack them unless you are also tier 3 size.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T07:56:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d1190bef835669bc7814f0ff1202f5a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lord Destro"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
