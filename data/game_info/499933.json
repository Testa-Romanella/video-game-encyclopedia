(at the very least you can shake your head in wonder at my chaotic process and way too ambitious plan).\u00a0 I learned so much about scoping, programming and designing that no matter what, I'm super proud to enter this mess into the jam.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Scot Manning - Math help with the model and general encouragement.<br/>Brian J.
