Using your special gun that can change the size of objects, your task is to sneakily steal precious artifacts.</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam is \"running out of space\". In Agent Cube, the artifacts you steal are humongous in size. They can't fit through the doors. So, you need to sneakily harvest space energy by enlarging other objects and use that space energy to shrink the artifacts all the while dodging enemy AI.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T10:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67c7c021e21e9b84ebfbc691db1c06a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HOnramp Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
