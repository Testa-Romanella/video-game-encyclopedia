Running through the Itch app apparently works around this issue for some folks.</strong><br/></p><p>From Avery Genetti of b.trx studio and Ben Burnes, comes Danmaku Kingdom - a thrilling combination of classic action-RPG and vertical shooter elements, made for Ludum Dare 41's Jam category under the \"combine 2 incompatible genres\" theme.</p>\n<p>This release of the game only contains some of the intended final game's levels and features. We'd like to make a more complete version of this game in the future and will update this page if and when we are able to do so.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>On the level select screen, use up/down to select an area, and left/right to select a level within that area. You may also access a shop, which currently only sells health for 50g.</p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>Z - Regular fire</p>\n<p>X - Magic shots (requires mana)</p>\n<p>C - Change element of magic shot</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - move</p>\n<p>Using the magic shot will deplete the mana bar, which needs a cooldown and recharge period if depleted. Hitting enemies with the regular shot will gradually refill it.</p>\n<p>-------------</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art, programming, sfx - b.trx\u00a0 (Avery Genetti) -\u00a0\u00a0 http://btrx.studio</p>\n<p>Music - Benjamin\u00a0Burnes - http://abstractionmusic.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/495/4952ccadb594729332e63e15253c0b4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["b.trx"], "genres": ["Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
