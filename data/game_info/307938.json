Nobody else seems to notice things repeating.</p>\n<p><strong>???:</strong> A crying boy you meet at an intersection.</p>\n<p><strong>???:</strong> An angry looking girl that seems to be blocking the shortest way to school.</p>\n<p><strong>???:</strong> Some sort of spider that seems to know what's going on.</p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>So for Nano this year I decided to go for something of a smaller scale in the hopes of getting in completed within the month. :3<br/>So it should be pretty short in the end, even with the looping. [size=85]Though I'm not sure how short exactly yet.[/size]</p>\n<p><strong>Current Progress:</strong><br/>So i ended up with a bunch of other things taking time from working on this so i didn't get very far during the nanoreno2019 time limit. Its very bare-bones atm, but i'll finish it up once nano is over.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T06:14:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/36210dd623e9228518d9ee101082db74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marionette"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
