On the bottom left of the screen is a power bar, this affects how far the ball is fired. </p><p>-----------VR-----------</p><p>The VR player has a sheild and bat which can be used as protection from the balls. Small arrows can be seen on either controller which will point towards the currently active cannons. </p><p>-----------Future-----------<br/></p><p>This game was created in under 10 hours as our first VR project.
