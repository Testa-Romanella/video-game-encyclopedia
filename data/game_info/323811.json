{"id": 323811, "slug": "shuffs", "name": "Shuffs", "name_original": "Shuffs", "description": "Shuffs is a physics-based puzzle game which makes use of platforming controls as a means of hurling projectiles wherever a projectile may need hurling. It's essentially mini-golf, but the kind of mini-golf where you can hit the ball straight into the air, jump up after it and whack it mid-air into the face of a fire-spitting demon.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a game for those who don't feel as though they've earned their victory if said victory was obtained without experiencing the inclination to scream at their computer at least once. The simple core mechanic (walk up to round object, hit round object) is expanded on and diversified over 38 levels, seeing you catapult boulders with crocodile jaws, ride on the webs of spiders as you propel them through the air, or just kick back and play a little keep-up with a balloon in one of the 24 bonus levels you can unlock if you're a good little scarecrow who works their way through the 36 funky stunt shots scattered throughout the farms, swamps and industrial district of Bowkin County.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe story takes about 2 - 3 hours to complete, and up to an additional 2 hours to achieve the true ending.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T22:57:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f21/f21cc990f56348a82deb9eec880e8f36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ThisIsn'tKyle", "Kyle Hosking"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Sports", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["No Relation Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
