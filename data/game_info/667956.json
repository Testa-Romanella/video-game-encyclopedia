{"id": 667956, "slug": "muzakotron-8b", "name": "Muzakotron-8b", "name_original": "Muzakotron-8b", "description": "<p>Muzakotron-8b is a standalone piece of procedurally generated monophonic music. \u00a0<br/><br/>It picks a BPM, a key and scales and never stops. It does transitions and randomization on the go indefinitely (well, supposedly). \u00a0<br/><br/>It's got 2 melodic parts : bass and lead. Both made of 3 oscillators of varying shapes and some filtering.\u00a0 <br/>It's also got a couple noise based channels for the rhythmic section (kick, snare and hats).\u00a0 <br/><br/>And custom made animations reminiscent of NES-era games.<br/><br/>The \"INSERT COIN\" button resets the whole thing. \u00a0<br/>If you press escape, it quits.<br/><br/>That's it. \u00a0<br/><br/><br/>The generated music can be used for anything and anywhere, including streaming and youtube. It's not sample-based so it shouldn't trigger any DMCA or anything.\u00a0 <br/>Credit would be nice, though.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T04:31:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/444/4449d89f50ae426dc5318b25ff3c64bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["R734"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
