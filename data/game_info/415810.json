The theme is \"plague\" and in this game YOU are the plague, a mosquito that has to get blood from a nearby human. </p>\n<p><em>How long can you survive without being smashed and at the same time provide your children with blood?</em></p>\n\n<p>The highscores are not saved in the html version, don't know how to do it and it's not very important either. Also it can be quite slow in the browser, so if you have trouble, try the downloads. I hope they work, because I cannot test them.</p>\n<p>Now go have some fun!</p>\n\n<p><em>by TreeTimes and Socke Magneti<br/>Music: https://opengameart.org/content/menu-music</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/210d46921ee164cb8c06135e5d593c18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["TreeTimes"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
