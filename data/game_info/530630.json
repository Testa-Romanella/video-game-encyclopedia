{"id": 530630, "slug": "punch-card-hell", "name": "Punch Card Hell", "name_original": "Punch Card Hell", "description": "<p>You wake up in a daze unsure of who you are or where you are. You are outside of an office building with a punch card in your hand. Something about today screams \"Monday\". You also have a list of very vague instructions.</p>\n<p>Complete your tasks before your shift ends to make it to the next day. If you don't you could find yourself stuck in the purgatory of Monday forever. If you can make it to the weekend you've beaten the game and escaped office hell!</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to move. Press 'e' to interact, and use the space bar to speed up time to finish a day quicker.</p>\n<p>Word of warning, you will have no feedback for completion of tasks until the end of the day. If you were successful, the next day will start. If you were not, you will find yourself waking up in the morning of the same day. Also not every interactable works the same every day, so keep experimenting :)</p>\n<p>I made this game as a part of Mini Game Jam 69: Hell. The theme is hell, and the limitation is that cards must be used as a mechanic.</p><p>I wanted to try to come up with an original implementation of \"cards\" so I decided to use punch cards! Which then led to the idea of a Groundhog Day type hell where you keep punching the same day over and over with no progress.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T03:00:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ea/0ea23fe6e9b2caf8b3db4efdf20fccc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["logicPuddle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
