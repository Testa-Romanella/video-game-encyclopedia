On release, the art style will be different but similar and the gameplay will be deeper but still uncomplicated.<br/></p>\n<p>(formerly known as \"Project Peg-Leg\" and \"CC\")\r\n</p>\n<p>Currently I'm looking for feedback on the feel of the controls and movement, suggested gameplay mechanics, and (to a lesser degree) feedback on the visuals and style. Bug reports and suggested fixes are welcomed. Please be specific\u00a0about any problem you have, whether it's a bug or not.<br/></p>\n<p>Many of the changes from the last demo are behind the scenes. The most visible changes are much better scrolling (still some kinks to work out though), better lanterns, and a somewhat more subdued visual aesthetic.</p>\n<p>If you want to help this game look better, please contact me. I'm willing to pay for art. Amounts and details are negotiable.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls can be changed to virtually anything. Standard keyboards and Xbox-compatible controllers are supported. Stairs are designed to be able to be walked past. To get on stairs, use the up or down arrow when at the bottom or top of the stairs.<br/></p>\n<p>Default controls:</p>\n<p>Movement - Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Attack - F</p>\n<p>Jump - Spacebar</p>\n<p>Climb ledge - D<br/></p>\n<p>Get on stairs - Up arrow/down arrow</p>\n<p>Enter door - R</p>\n<p>Pause - Escape<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67215b907e0d83d3584874c7acf8003.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["General Vagueness"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
