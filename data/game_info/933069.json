All this to assert his supremacy, because now the other types of dice seem to be taking over. The goal is to defend himself as much as possible within the map. There is no real ending: the goal is to survive as much as possible, as the dice increase, and to score the best score.\r\n You have at your disposal six weapons given by the number of faces that come up immediately after activating the \"<strong>SHAKE</strong>\" function. Each weapon is held by a different dice variant.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Game submitted for the\u00a0\u00a0Bay Area Jam Jam</p>\n<p><strong>Team Artoomics</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game designers:</strong> Eleonora Blandini\u00a0- Fabio Cao<br/><strong>Concept artist:</strong> Fabio Bonu'<br/><strong>Developer:</strong> Pietro Prebianca<br/><strong>Animators:</strong> Ilaria Brandolese - Mara Piazzalunga - Linda Pirovano<br/><strong>Sound designer:</strong> Aleksandr Fedoseev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T07:01:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a0/9a070037a4d96fc0b78cf4af5b95408f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Artoomics-Milunart", "Kegbird - PP", "Igussu", "AnimateYaya", "MaraPzz", "Artomics games-Fabio", "Manson99"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
