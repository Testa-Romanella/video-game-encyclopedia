{"id": 103285, "slug": "grand-prix-itch", "name": "Grand Prix (itch)", "name_original": "Grand Prix (itch)", "description": "<p>Grand Prix is a racing game inspired by Pole Position and other racing games from the previous century. These games do not use a complete 3d system but rather a fixed forward view on a track that is accomplished with 2d game techniques, as explained and illustrated on Lou's Pseudo 3d Page. <br/></p>\n<p> In Grand Prix, the ultimate goal for the player is to try and complete 8 laps, winning the gold cup. This is quite a challenge, with the clock ticking down and opponent cars getting in the way. The car is controlled using the arrow keys. At the start of the game a car can be selected: the green one is the slowest and easiest to handle, the black one is the fastest.<br/> </p>\n<p>The music in this game is by coda (coda.s3m.us). Sound effects were made using SFXR, and the game was programmed in Blitz Max. The Blitz Max source code is included in the download.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19f/19fa65f9548742b9ae5265baac8b8d06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Foppygames"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
