The theme was to combine two game genres and I chose Racing + Bullet Hell.</p>\n<p>The lore I was thinking for this game is that there are many trucks that are dropping these boxes in front of the road, but I didn't implemented it so its not cannon. As far as I'm aware there might be a portal to the box dimension at the end of Scrap Road. Guess we'll never know.<br/></p>\n<p>All art, and music was made by me.
