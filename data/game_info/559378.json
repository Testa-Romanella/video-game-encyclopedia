The game is a copter-like where you have to avoid the cave rocks while gathering more health to stay in the air. Try to get to the end!</p>\n<p>The game was made in 2 days time as part of a game development course. The assignment was to create a game in the style of Copter Classic or Flappy Bird and this is what I came up with.</p>\n<p>Please tell me in the comments if you would like to see more of this game, it could perhaps be made into a mobile game. I would also like to hear your feedback on the look and feel of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ba/5ba8eedda1ceca9d0816f7e23971f612.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Petter Skogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
