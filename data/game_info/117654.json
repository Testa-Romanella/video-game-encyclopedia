Without leaving your living room. Behind \r\nyour desk at work, on the train, or just relaxing at home, chopping wood\r\n has never been so easy and fun... In fact, you don't even have to lift \r\nan axe.</p><p>\r\n\tTry LoggerBill, the second release from MapleScot development and our\r\n first to use the LibGDX game development library. It is inspired by a \r\ngame that is currently very popular on Android and iOS devices, but \r\nnaturally we think our version is better.</p>Instructions<p>\r\n\tUse the left and right arrow keys to stand on that side and swing your axe. <br/>\r\n\tAs you chop out 'chunks' of the tree the branches will move down, don't let them hit you!<br/>\r\n\tChop as fast as you can - a timer at the top of the screen quickly runs down and you need to chop to replenish it.<br/>\r\n\tThe further you go, the faster the time drains... You need to chop faster and faster to keep going.</p>Details<p>\r\n\tAfter writing The Shaft we felt that we had a pretty good \r\nunderstanding of Mobile Development, but we would like the option to \r\nport future games to other platforms. We decided to give LibGDX a try as\r\n a framework for future development. We were drawn to LibGDX because it \r\nis entirely Java, cross platform, feature-rich, open source, and \r\nnon-restrictive. As game developers (not designers) we wanted to write \r\nas much of the 'engine' ourselves as possible. LibGDX gave us the tools \r\nto design and build the game the way we wanted to without excessive \r\noverhead. The tools provided simply compliment the code to ease common \r\ntasks and allow us to focus on the game. Ultimately We wrote this game \r\nas a quick and simple test to evaluate LibGDX to ensure that it would \r\nmeet our needs. You may notice that it's similar to a certain other \r\nwood-cutting game on the market. We learned a lot from writing this \r\nsimple game and hope to demonstrate to others how a simple, but popular \r\ngame can be written in LibGDX for Android. In particular it was \r\nimportant to us that the user experience be smooth. The Back-button \r\noften doesn't work on games ported over from Apple devices and this \r\nvexes us greatly, so we've take care to make sure that everything works \r\nas one would expect for a quality game.</p><p>\r\n\tWe are still learning though, this is only our second game so we need\r\n your help to bring our many (more original) ideas to the world. So, \r\nwe've released this game as Open Source. We would like to invite \r\neveryone to view our code. If you use our ideas, designs, or have \r\nlearned anything from our code we would love to hear from you and we \r\nwould love to have your feedback and suggestions on how to improve the \r\ngame or how to improve our code.</p><p>Get more details and the link to the source code here</p><p>\r\n\tAs a demo of the capabilities of LibGDX this game demonstrates:</p><ul>\n<li>Use of Google Play Games<ul>\n<li>Achievements</li>\n<li>Leaderboards</li>\n<li>Cloud Save</li>\n<li>Admob Ads</li></ul></li><li>Smooth transition from screens, menus, popup dialogs.
