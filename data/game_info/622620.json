It may take some getting used to since it&#39;s something totally new, but we strongly believe that it sets Line War apart from similar games.<br />\nLine War focuses on strategy. We&#39;ve designed the game around the typical RTS-problems to remove the steep learning curve and need for ultra-fast micro-management so you can focus on planning and executing a strategy.<br />\nDuring Early Access; Line War is a multiplayer-only game!
