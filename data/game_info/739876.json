You used to feel like you can stand at the top if you jump. You had believed, your wings will bring you to the peak of the sky but instead it sends you down to the abyss making you wish that you can no longer recall how it feels to fly. Trapped to the ground knowing your life is fleeting and short-lived.\r\n</p>\n<p>You are no longer the person that everyone still believes you are, yet you missed the person you had been and could still be. Death waits for you with an hourglass as you walk on the spinning world. You\u00a0 know you would only leave a short, brief ,and unmemorable influence in this world.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your heart and body are numb to feeling, you feel like you are no longer living. As you anticipate for the hour of your final breath to willingly accept the cold embrace of death, you feel like the world is no longer worth trying because it will always leave you crying, and only when you had given up and your heart left with an inerasable stain.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>You will find hope to live again.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T05:14:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cb/5cb2e5dc844cf64e47dfe3afa28d66c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jaunefleur"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
