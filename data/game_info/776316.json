As you grow closer, they start to crack, eventually shattering to reveal the beautiful person underneath each one.<br/><br/>You've just arrived to college as a transfer student. Since many people made friends during freshman year, you're having a hard time socializing with others. Barely making it to the end of your first class, you find a seat next to <strong>JODIE (she/her, 20)</strong>. She acknowledges your presence, but that's about it. It seems she has a tough shell, but you can tell that there's a softer person underneath it all. On the way out of class, you (literally) run into a frazzled <strong>ARJUN (he/him, 20)</strong> who is rushing to office hours. He seems sweet, though caught up in his own head. Finally, you make it back to your dorm, where you meet <strong>BILLIE (they/them, 21)</strong>. They excitedly knock on your door to meet the new neighbor, talking at about 1,000 words per second. Its a lot to handle, but you can tell that they mean well and would be a ton of fun to hang out with. <br/><br/>The best part: on your first day, you've been invited to hang out by all three of them! What these interactions turn into depends on the choices you make. Any which way, you'll come out of this experience with meaningful relationships.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T04:15:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e686fd483ce21ec90a66c6c917e2257b.jpg", "website": "https://curtaincallvn.wixsite.com/home", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dramatis Personae Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Juggernaut Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
