I decided to go with the results of\u00a0an unstable government.</p>\n\n<p>Riots have broken out in the city. You are to manage the cities response to try and bring stability back to the populous.</p>\n\n<p>In this computer board game you place the police units to attempt to disperse the riots. To win eliminate all riots and prevent any new ones from forming. If they take all the government buildings, you lose. The military might become available to assist you but be careful, while they might disperse a riot they will also encourage a new one to form.</p>\n\n<p>*** Known Bugs ***</p>\n<ul><li>It is possible to \u201cstack\u201d your police units. This will provide no benefit as they still only act as one. To move one when this happens just click on it again and move.\r\n</li><li>Sometimes the riot tokens will stack. Again they only act as one for scoring but they will require multiple attempts to eliminate.\r\n</li><li>Once a game is won or lost starting a new game will not work correctly. The initial riot tokens will not move. I've not been able to fix this bug yet. If you want to play a new game you will have to restart the game.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T14:54:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb7/bb70e8a898006ebff0e409b4accd2c9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JammyGunns"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
