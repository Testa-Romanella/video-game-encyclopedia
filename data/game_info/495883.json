The murderer, B\u00e1rbara Jim\u00e9nez, known as \u201cThe Witch of Albayz\u00edn\u201d has managed to escape from the asylum where she has been for the last 45 years. Several crimes are attributed to her; among them are the kidnappings and the murder of many children. Some bodies have not yet been found, although according to the police sources she has likely eaten them as a part of some strange ritual. A warrant has been issued for her arrest and the authorities have attempted to calm citizens by empathizing that she is not a large threat to public safely. \"The Witch\", now almost 80 years old, has no legs due to an accident she suffered in her youth.<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Download\u00a0the\u00a0original\u00a0soundtrack\u00a0in\u00a0Bandcamp:</strong>\u00a0https://yawngames.bandcamp.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35c62b9b2c28d4248eae5731437b9871.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Yawn Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
