She lost her scholarship after failing to keep up her grades due to her family problems, and on top of that, she even got kicked out of the dormitory after being unable to pay the monthly rent. With nowhere to go, she seeks the help of her best friend, Lyle, who refers her to a family friend who accepts boarders in their house.
