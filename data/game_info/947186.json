However, you must consider that this will apply to every other mini-golf course on the screen!\r\n</p>\n<p>======\r\n</p>\n<p>This project was quite challenging. Although it ended up being very short, I managed to build something reasonably polished. Furthermore, I believe that this concept could be expanded in the future! Unfortunately, a nasty bug appeared at the end of the 3-hour development deadline, which ate into the time I had allocated for implementing audio.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T08:48:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b71/b71123fc0bd00b6ab84ed934069f5304.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ViniAleixo"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
