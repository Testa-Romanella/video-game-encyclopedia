Last night, our intrepid hero arrived in the holy monastery town of Firesend, to begin his pilgrimage, to visit the shrines, to pray and reflect, to find enlightenment, and perhaps to find atonement for a dramatically unspecified and narratively compelling shadowy past... <br/>...Of course, first he stopped off at the pub. And that's about as far as his sepia-toned memory gets before it turns to purulent purple, and fades to black amid a blur of booze and bad choices.<br/><br/><strong>An Internalized Episodic Series...</strong><br/>Forgoing traditional episodic releases, The Pilgrimage is tale that will grow in the telling. <strong>Play Chapter 1 now, for free!</strong> When you reach the end of chapter 1, don't lose that save - pick up where you left off as soon as chapter 2 is released as a free update to the core game! In the meantime, keep playing and exploring!<br/>Grab The Pilgrimage for free any time before the final chapter is released, and it's yours to have and to hold, from this day forward, till Windows 11 do us part!<h3>Presenting Chapter 1: The Porcelain Crown of Regret</h3><br/>We join our fated hero the morning after, with his face in a puddle of filth, besieged by the cruel sobriety of the coming day, and the voice of a landlord laying claim to a debt. He has no money, he has no memory, he... frankly has no hope of avoiding the impending consequences of his actions. But when you hit rock bottom, the only way is up... right?<br/>With a key in his pocket, and high hopes for a shower and a change of clothes, he sets off with a lurch in his stride and a pain in the back of his head.<br/><br/>So begins his grand journey through the trials and tribulations of a foreign town at the crack of dawn.<br/>Will he survive the first few hours of his adventure?<br/>Will he even make it to the end of Chapter 1?<br/>With any luck, he'll see some sights, buy some tacky souvenirs, and begin to uncover a tale of love, crime, treasure, more crime, pain, tragedy, triumph, booze, a bit more crime, a number of awkward conversations, and a sprinkling of crime. For isn't that what all good holidays are about?<br/><br/><strong>Tragedy and triumph...</strong><br/>Explore! Interact!
