Your objective is to eliminate\u00a0 them by using various weapons\u00a0to take your home back and win.</p>\n<p>Be careful....they attack pretty hard.</p>\n<p>NOTE FROM ME, THE DEVELOPER:</p>\n<p>To start off.....I first want to say\u00a0this is my first time uploading a game on this website. I design and build in Unity called THE TAKEOVER. I designed this game over the summer. The game build started out doing a tutorial within Unity and turning it around by using my ideas and\u00a0various assets in Unity's assets store\u00a0to build the game. The assets I used\u00a0for this game called Sci-Fi Styled Modular Pack by Karboosx.\u00a0I thought these assets would be prefect for my game :)\u00a0Being in college studying game design, I'm still learning a lot about how games are made and so far I love making games within Unity. I learned lot about working in Unity, still learning though. I have other games I made for college courses, however, I'm going to go back and work, and add things to them. But for this game, I wanted to make a whole new game that I want to take my time with and taking the knowledge I learn from college courses and outside of the courses to see my knowledge and ideas come to life.</p>\n<p>So please feel free to leave your ratings, suggestions and improvements that I can make in the comments, after you tried the game!</p>\n<p>Thank you again! :)<br/></p>\n<p>MADE WITH:</p>\n<p>Unity</p>\n<p>PLATFORM:</p>\n<p>This game is only made for window users.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game supports Keyboard and Mouse as well a Gamepad.</p>\n<p>BE SURE TO LOOK AT THE CONTROLS BEFORE PLAYING!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T12:02:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9b/a9b433a5deb799f9f9104b86aca9254c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Malia Scott"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
