Spacemen work diligently to be rescued from their failing outpost, but not everyone is who they claim to be...<br />\nForm alliances with other Spacemen and complete objectives, or, if you&#39;re not so human -- blend in, disguise yourself, and sabotage plans, betraying your friends and allies in the most gruesome ways imaginable. Death is part of life in space, and you&#39;re no exception to the rule. Paranoia runs rampant.<br />\nAre you the victim, or the cause?<br />\nCheck out our Development Starmap to see our full plans!<br />\nCurrent Features: Survive, hunt, or escape on desolate settlements, arctic outposts, derelict space stations, warp-speed hypertrains, or ancient digsites on alien worlds. 14 maps are available right now, with more currently in development, and even more planned after that! (New maps are always FREE!)<br />\nAs a Spaceman, complete objectives to call down the Rescue Shuttle, or hunt the Monster in packs!<br />\nProximity Chat: All in-game communication fades with distance from the speaker, so you can roam, sneak, hide, and eavesdrop as you hunt or run from other players!<br />\nMimic and devour your &#39;fellow&#39; Spacemen as the Monster from the blackest reaches of the galaxy! Lay eggs, disguise as other players, transform into your hideous Monster Form, and more!<br />\nProtect or betray your allies with at least a dozen unique tools, weapons, and items!<br />\nRank up through The Company to unlock new customization and perks to customize your playstyle!<br />\nSecurity Guards (Bots) roam the facility with diverse personalities. Use them to help learn the ropes and practice, or just add more chaos to a multiplayer game!<br />\nSupports up to 32 players in a single game!<br />\nRandomized objectives every time you play. No two rounds play exactly the same!<br />\nCustomize your Spaceman (or Spacewoman) to stand out, or blend in!<br />\nAdditional Co-op Survival Mode: Survive with your friends against progressively more difficult waves of enemies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T03:36:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/737/737df20717c559152ce159d809c1e5fd.jpg", "website": "http://unfortunate.space", "rating": 2.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 44, "owned": 909, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 34, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 73, "ratings_count": 49, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 50, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sandswept", "Geoff \"Zag\" Keene"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["New Blood Interactive", "Sandswept"], "esrb_rating": null}
