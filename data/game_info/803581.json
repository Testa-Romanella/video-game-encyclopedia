{"id": 803581, "slug": "rock-paper-roguelike", "name": "Rock Paper Roguelike", "name_original": "Rock Paper Roguelike", "description": "<p>A roguelike deckbuilder where you try to get as deep into a dungeon as possible. In order to defeat the enemies found within, you have the power of Rock Paper Scissors (RPS)\u00a0on your side.</p><p>The dungeon contains several rooms on each floor. Each room can contain enemies, treasures or other things to improve your deck. At the end of each floor is a boss that guards the stairs up to the next floor.</p><p>The battles are done using double blind selection of the typical RPS signs with some added special moves. The cards are two-sided with some cards having additional effects on the other side that can be used instead of the regular RPS sign.</p><p>This is a prototype which I built because I wanted to play around with levels building up using blocks every time you switch room. I used RPS to build a simple deckbuilding framework around. The game is mainly built for mobile but also works for PC using the mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T16:52:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39def2233201999fb0c8fae94980bd2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android"], "developers": ["Parrexion Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
