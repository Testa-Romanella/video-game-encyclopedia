Have friends to play with you and enjoy yourself.. no battle pass or anything crazy.. just enjoy yourselves and have fun!!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat this game expresses:<br/>\r\nI want Deadly Maze to help build friendships and make new ones with Co-op. Take your friends and put them in a 1v1 situation. Have a grudge with someone take them to in there and see how many times you can beat them. All in all... I hope everyone enjoys my game!!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nContent:<br/>\r\nWe got all kinds of modes: 1v1, 1v3, 2v2, cooperative and last team standing. For those who just want to play and have nobody to play with there is a singleplayer mode so you can train and learn the maps if you need to. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOverview of the game:<br/>\r\nIts a really simple arcade shooter. When I say simple.. I really mean simple... I wanted to focus on the gameplay over graphics. I am still new with this engine so I had to go back to old school gameplay so there is very little animation. I just want players to have fun playing this game and to meet new people.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T02:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc0/fc0d4709d1b5a19309cd39e16a973a07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sheer Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sheer Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
