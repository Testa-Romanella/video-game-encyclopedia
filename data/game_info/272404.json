In this game,\u00a0the player has the freedom of\u00a0movement, such as jump, wall jump, and other crazy movement.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>All the shapes used to live in their own planet without paying much attention to other shapes. One day, the circles found something unique that can only be found on their planet. Hearing this news, the other shapes joined forces to invade the circles' planet. The circles were caught unprepared and some of them went into hiding while bringing the artifact with them. Some of the circles train themselves so they can drive off the invaders from their planet. When they are ready, they use the artifact to go back in the past. Using the training they have done in the future, will it be enough to fight the invaders?</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The player controls a circle/ball with the ability to jump and wall jump. By using the environment to jump and build up speed, player can reach places that are otherwise inaccessible by normal jump. Players can only bounce on a side of a wall once in a row. Players also have the ability to stomp, going down in high speed. The stomp can be used to defeat enemies. By combining these mechanics, players can traverse the level quickly or at their own pace.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d36654e5bfd31090480ebbbad960c46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crimson Nebulous"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
