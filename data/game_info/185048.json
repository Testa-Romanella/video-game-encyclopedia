This game was not only made by me (Simon) but also with my Friend and Co-Founder of Unknown Games Studios Alex.</p>\n<p>The second game on this account is also not sparkling with gameplay-depth or awesome looking UI elements. It was a very spontaneous project which we made in 1.5 hours time. Its main purpose was to show Alex some things in C#, since he is new to programming.</p>\n\n<p>Like with the first project, we're not heading towards a complex game design or anything similar, we just wanted to make something on one afternoon in order to try new things - you are very welcome to leave feedback, and soon we will be back with a new (better) game :)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Cheers, Simon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/183992bee2b7d9fcc09102b46080ba91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unknown Games Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
