Release to rejoin them. Catch the blue dots before they cross the left side of the screen. But, avoid the red dots which will instantly kill the snakes upon contact. Try to catch the blue hexagons to get various powerups. The powerups will either protect the snakes from the red dots or help you get blue dots more easily.</p>\r\nTheGoalOfTheGame\r\n<p>Keep your snakes alive for as long as possible. When you miss a blue dot or hit a red dot, you will lose a life. You start off with 5 lives and you'll die when you lose all of them.</p>\r\nHookToMakeYouGoPlayIt\r\n<p>Only one question remains : How far will you go?</p>\n<p>No ads.
