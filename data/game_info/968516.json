Explore procedurally generated environments in first or third person as a bounty hunter afflicted by a strange plague that causes the body to vanish completely after death. Maybe this hunter will be the one to collect the bounty that everyone is after, but more likely his or her money and equipment will come into possession of the next damned soul to be ferried to this cold corner of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCombat is not often honorable here. Achieve victory by any means necessary; slide past your foes while you slice at them, use your lasso to ensure your shots hit, or throw any weapon for a last-ditch attack. Sometimes fights are best avoided; not everyone and everything here wants to kill you, but most are able to.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCadleiu is about retracing your path through a dangerous and constantly changing world, or trying a new one, and trying not to die again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSurvive long enough and gain enough experience and you'll break this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-30T02:33:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ee/5ee11c196042c0df06fa2f06f182e867.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keenan Evans"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Keenan Evans"], "esrb_rating": null}
