When you consider it appropriate use gravity and time capsules to make the task easier.</p>\n<p>To\u00a0<strong>draw a line</strong>:<br/>- Decide when it is convenient to\u00a0<strong>start by pressing the left mouse button</strong>.\u00a0<br/>-\u00a0<strong>Draw</strong>\u00a0the line across the screen by\u00a0<strong>moving the mouse</strong>.\u00a0<br/>- When you decide to\u00a0<strong>finish</strong>\u00a0the line, simply\u00a0<strong>release the left mouse button</strong>. If you caught the target\u2019s pieces and made fewer mistakes than the maximums allowed in the level, you will get \u201cgoal accomplished\u201d and more points, if you don\u2019t get it you will lose points.</p>\n<p><strong>Timelapse</strong>: if you have time capsules available (lower left corner) and press the\u00a0SPACE\u00a0key, it will stop the time and this way it will be much easier for you to fulfill the objective.</p>\n<p>While drawing the line, other types of figures may appear randomly:<br/>- a\u00a0<strong>heart</strong>: catch it and it will receive an extra life<br/>- a\u00a0<strong>time capsule</strong>: catch it so you can use it and stop time.<br/>- a\u00a0<strong>diamond</strong>: catch it to get more points<br/>- a\u00a0<strong>planet earth</strong>: catch it and all the pieces fall by the effect of gravity</p>\n<p>Also, sometimes there will be\u00a0<strong>wind</strong>, be careful as the pieces will move by the force of it.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your support!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68f/68f79aac891900a7d60a6ccef7d21e95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BuenRato"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
