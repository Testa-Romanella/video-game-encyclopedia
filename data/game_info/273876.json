You must sacrifice the residents, in order to gain blood and buy upgrades. You have 7 days to get as many kills as possible! Don't kill too many though, or the police will come, and that is bad!</p>\n\n\n<p>Once your in game, you will see a resident(green box) go up to the counter. If you hold left click on the text box, it will fill up. It resident will then go to their room. At night you can kill the residents and they will drop blood. Watch out for the guard, as if he catches you, then your suspicion will go up by a lot. Use blood to buy upgrades and try to kill the most residents before 7 days. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Made by: Ethan Meyer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/5163dbf9fb8fd69dcc68746188b744ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ethan_meyer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
