Some tutorials can be finished in a second and some levels can be played for more than an hour.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is about building and planning and optimizing, but it's all very casual. You can undo any mistake and try something else. You can also do nothing and just watch the clouds go by.<br/></p>\n<p>If you experience any technical issues or if there is anything you would like to see done differently, i would love to hear it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>System requirements:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Pink Skies uses some features of OpenGl 3.3. This should be no problem on most systems. If it doesn't run on your system, please tell me, and I can try to fix it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T04:27:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/004/0048aeee60e7d043feefb182bb48d16e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["trudieprod"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
