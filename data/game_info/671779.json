A company representative explained that they had no interest in challenging industry titans behind the games that Team Slime wanted <strong>FALLSTAR</strong> to take on. Discouraged from putting more time, effort, and money into the game, the friends cut their losses, halting work on <strong>FALLSTAR</strong> in the final months of its development and dissolving Team Slime as a corporate entity.\u00a0\r\nThere has been plenty of innovation in the handheld arcade shooter space in the three decades since the Game Boy was released, but our team members keep going back to <strong>FALLSTAR</strong>. Sometimes it's to try different crew member abilities; other times, it's to take down the bosses that punctuate the game's intelligently generated stages.\r\nHaving played the game so much ourselves, we felt compelled to restore and release <strong>FALLSTAR</strong> for everyone else to enjoy, too!\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Character art and animation\u00a0</strong>- austinbrook (@austindotorg), jane underscore (@janederscore), victoria lacroix\u00a0(@arachonteur)</li><li><strong>Character design\u00a0</strong>- austinbrook, victoria lacroix, mabel mabel</li><li><strong>Cover art</strong> - austinbrook\u00a0</li><li><strong>Fake ad copy\u00a0</strong>- blues (@blues_turn_gold)</li><li><strong>Gilmore Girls expert\u00a0</strong>- austinbrook</li><li><strong>Portrait art\u00a0</strong>- gwen lawson (@reziarts), sid vesper</li><li><strong>Programming</strong> - victoria lacroix</li><li><strong>Audio\u00a0</strong>- austinbrook, victoria lacroix</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T07:03:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/833/83395f9e5f6ce86e4ee7eb618ee1fb48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["victoria lacroix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
