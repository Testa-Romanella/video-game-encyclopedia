{"id": 663273, "slug": "tri-quest", "name": "Tri Quest", "name_original": "Tri Quest", "description": "<p>Tri Quest\u00a0is a game I made in about 2 days for the \"Stop Waiting For Godot\"\u00a0game jam!</p>\n<p>It's a match-3 style puzzle game except the lines you create turn into attacks that will\u00a0help\u00a0defeat the\u00a0onslaught of ruthless enemies! There are many things I didn't get to add or finish, such as audio, and other fun ideas like\u00a0items and power-ups. There are also a few bugs I didn't get time to squash, so sorry if you run into any!</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>- Drag your mouse or finger across adjacent circles\u00a0to connect them.\u00a0Connect at least 3 circles of the same\u00a0colour to launch an attack. The direction of each line you draw directly affects which lanes of enemies you attack, and with how much strength. If the colour of the attack matches the colour of the enemy, you will deal much more damage!</p>\n<p>- Enemies take steps towards you every so often. If they get too close they will deal damage and take your HP away. The small circles\u00a0under each enemy shows its HP.</p>\n<p>Difficulty:</p>\n<p>- Easy = enemies are fewer, slower, and\u00a0weaker to other colours</p>\n<p>- Medium = normal difficulty.</p>\n<p>- Hard\u00a0= lots of enemies with lots of health! Enemies also move more often.</p>\n<p>- Zen = casual fun with no enemies. Go for a high score!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:05:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a6/7a6494c05962e36d226d315bad7c1f8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dogchamp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
