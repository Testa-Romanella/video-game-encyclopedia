Green tiles allow you to change gravity. Also you can use portals, enable some mechanics and drag/move objects (cubes). On this map, you have to collect 3 stars.\u00a0 If you want to help me developing this project, leave me a short comment about physics - or bugs which you found. Be free to share your feelings. Thank you for your help ++<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8c/c8c2909850e25d54d5d7c763ecfaaba2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
