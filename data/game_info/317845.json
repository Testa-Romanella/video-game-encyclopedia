I explored the theme of \"Home\" by asking, what makes a home? Is it the memories we make there? The presence of loved ones?

All of their uncle's possessions remain in the home, but perhaps there's something else, as well.....</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The art, writing, and coding for this game were done by Sam Inverts.<br/></p>\n<p>Two locations in the game use stock photos from unsplash.com:<br/>https://unsplash.com/photos/U1S7fDPMpf8<br/>https://unsplash.com/photos/-kh2s5BdwxI</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>\"Vanes\" and \"Bittersweet\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs: </strong>Music does not play in ever browser.
