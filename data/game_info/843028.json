I suppose my game isn't all that good, but I'm pretty satisfied with what I've completed in these 7 days. The game might not seem to fit the jam theme so well. But if you finish the entire game, you definitely would get the \"You're not alone\" part.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD or ARROW KEYS \u00a0to move<br/>Long press to jump higher<br/>When at the maximum height, press the jump key to double jump<br/>Special ability is revealed in the game.<br/><br/>INSTALLATION DETAILS:<br/>Just download the files and there will be a file called \"Just another stupid game ig.exe\"<br/>Open the file and you'd be able to play the game. press the windows key to pause, close, etc. Hey, if you actually read all these you have my heartful respect :D thanks for playing.
