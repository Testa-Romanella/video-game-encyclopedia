Straightforward tools make all the difference.Features<br/><strong>Canvas Extruder</strong>: A mutant hybrid between a selfie stick and a play-dough machine, the canvas extruder is where you can draw 2D shapes and pop them into the third dimension. Just set the Extrusion Depth and stamp a copy of your blob into the world. <br/><br/><strong>Teleporter</strong>: Point and go, anywhere in the world. If you want to go big, build scaffolds to stand on and remove them when you're done, or make a castle in the sky, it's up to you. Instantaneous transit means no movement to make you sick. Just pull the trigger and click your thumb.<br/><br/><strong>Grab</strong>: Positioning objects in a traditional 3D editor is tedious and complex, but here, it could not be simpler. Just reach out and grab any blobs to position them wherever you want.<br/><br/><strong>Paint</strong>: Monochromatic spaces are no fun, so you can easily choose the color of any blob before you stamp it into the world. Wanna change a blob's color after stamping? Just reach out with your brush and swipe it to the color you want.<br/><br/><strong>Cut</strong>: Don't like that blob? ZIP. Gone. Reach out with your scissor tool to remove blobs you don't like anymore. <br/><br/><strong>Export</strong>: Save directly to sketchfab for easy sharing, either to our account, or your own.
