However, Kilo H\u014dk\u016b can serve as an educational environment for anyone interested in learning about the H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba or wayfinding techniques.</p><p>The H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba\u00a0is a traditionally designed double-hulled Polynesian voyaging canoe, also known as a\u00a0<em>wa\u02bba kaulua</em>.\u00a0 Originally built on the island of O\u02bbahu in the state of Hawai\u02bbi in 1974, she was a key component of the Hawaiian Cultural Renaissance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The original 1976 voyage of the\u00a0H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba from Hawaii to Tahiti proved that original Hawaiian sailors and navigators did not randomly drift around the vast Pacific Ocean, but rather were active explorers and sailed with direction and purpose.\u00a0 She has since sailed around the entire world, making her first world-wide voyage from 2014 to 2017.\u00a0\u00a0More about the history of\u00a0H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba can be learned at http://www.hokulea.com/vessels/hokulea/ and\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dk%C5%ABle%CA%BBa</p>\n<p>The user will be exposed to the art of wayfinding through both immersion in the virtual environment and through visualizations that are commonly used to train navigators to recognize the movement of the night sky, such as the Hawaiian Star Compass. Through their experience, the user will be able to train their observation skills so that they will be able to understand their position in relation to the stars.</p>\n<p>Kilo H\u014dk\u016b VR requires a Steam Account, Steam VR, and the HTC Vive or Vive Pro to experience. \u00a0It has been shown to work on other VR headsets (Rift, Rift S, Index), but we are still in the process of testing on these platforms, so there may be bugs or controller mapping issues.<br/></p>\n<p>Additional materials and documentation are available at our website, https://kilohokuvr.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kilo H\u014dk\u016b is free to download!\u00a0 If you would like to support our work, we also accept donations. \u00a0All donated funds will be used for continued development and maintenance of the project.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T06:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/529/52933d21442ec05073387545c0a3581f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kilo Hoku VR", "Kehaunoe", "deanlodes", "anaxias", "pat_trick"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
