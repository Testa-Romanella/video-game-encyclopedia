This is why I subjected myself to a \"game jam\"\u00a0in which I must create a video game in one hour. I spent a few minutes before hand just brainstorming, then I created a folder and a blank script. Show time.</p>\n<p><strong>An hour passed and this little game emerged!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Made with\u00a0</strong>Pygame.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal:\u00a0</strong>Dodge projectiles. There's no scoring system, so just try as long as you can :)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Up and Down Arrows. The player will bounce off of the top and bottom of the screen.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The colors<strong> do not</strong> work well together.</li><li>The player particles are the wrong color (didn't have time!).</li><li>For people not familiar with gamedev: the hitbox is a rectangle. I'm not using an <em>engine</em>, so with this\u00a0little time: the hitbox will be a rectangle.</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0(Since this is such a small project, I do not think anyone will care to download it unless they're trying to learn Pygame or are just\u00a0<em>brain dead</em>. That to say, I didn't think there was a point to package it into an .exe.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T19:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/817/817ff4470fee769734ec296a43bd0be5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thbop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
