A lot of hostile cubes of other (a bit aggressive) colors want to reach him and break our cube apart.<br/>\r\nEach time levels are getting more complicated: more enemies, more mechanics and only one exit.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game you will control a blue cube. You need to reach an exit while dodging an impact with hostile cubes which will always try to catch you. Your goal in this game is to enjoy music and don't get angry. All levels are possible to complete. There is always a right way and it's way simpler than you could think.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T03:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d3/5d3dd253ad31b89f103b3554a82a9dc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pug Studio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pug Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
