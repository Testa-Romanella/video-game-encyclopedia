Wield your giant key to unlock foes for good, gain new abilities to strengthen your lock-picking power, and manage your health and keys to make your way to the end!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This really was a simple fun project I made in a few days, so let me know what you believe I can do to improve! I absolutely love feedback of any kind!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Having trouble?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It's okay! It's meant to be a hard game! If you'd like, you can activate Easy-Mode to unlock an easier path (but you won't be able to gain medals of your effects upon completion).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here's how to unlock easy mode: In the first room, place your key on the bottom-left corner of the room, go to the very top-right of the room and press the dash button. Each time you do so you gain one health, so give yourself as much health that you think you'll need.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Activating Easy Mode will double the damage delt with your key, give you more health and place some anvils in the starting room so you can get some keys if you'd like as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Confused?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Understandable, nothing in-game is explained, like, at all. I personally believe it's a fun experience to play the game blind and figure out each element by hand, but that's coming from the one who already knows everything about the game, so here's some informative tips to help you on your journey.</p>\n<p>- Red doors cost one key, Yellow doors (with shops on the other side) cost three keys, and blue doors (with the boss room on the other side) cost five keys.</p>\n<p>- Red anvils trade one key for one health, and purple anvils trade one health for one key</p>\n<p>- Swinging your key resets the enemy's invincibility, so spam your key on an enemy to give an extra punch of damage!</p>\n<p>- The farther to the right you go, the more abundant and strong the enemies get!</p>\n<p>- Yellow enemies dash right to your location, Blue enemies dash around your location, and Red enemies dash behind your location!</p>\n<p>- Each of the effects found in the shops have their own unique ability, and for many of them it's not exactly clear what they do, so here's the slice of what they all do:</p>\n<p>Big Key: Extends the length and range of your key<br/>Spring: Bounces your key forward upon swinging<br/>Spinning Key: After swinging, the key will continue spinning vigorously<br/>Dash Smoke: Your dash creates clouds of smoke behind you that damage enemies<br/>Unlocked Shoes: Increases your running speed<br/>Sharp Key: Increases the damage dealt by x1.5<br/>Lock Attack: A rectangle of area between you and your key damages enemies when you attack<br/>Extra Health: Adds\u00a0five health<br/>Shield: Provides invincibility while dashing, allowing you to dash right through enemies</p>\n<p>Cover art by @PineCanLive on Twitter!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T08:58:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/189/1894cf28fd2d9035d10efcc0323f69a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Craftyman6"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
