Most of what you see is subject to change.<br/><br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Set on a steampunk town of smart dogs, Project Clockwork is an open ended third person adventure game with RPG elements.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Inspired by games such as Zelda:\u00a0Breath of the Wild, Fable and Ratchet &amp; Clank, Project Clockwork main focus is on being fun with loads of progression systems, quests, areas to explore and much more.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The game is under active development by me: Leonardo Delafiori. You can download the latest public version of the game and directly influence it's direction as I work on it.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>In Project Clockwork, gameplay is focused on giving you a range of fun gadgets and weapons to help you scavenge, explore, fight, farm and much more.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Want an awesome helicopter Top hat that lets you fly?\u00a0 Maybe a mobile turret attached to your shoulders that will keep an watchful eye for enemies?\u00a0 What about a robot pet that helps you on combat?\u00a0 Or even rocket boots ? Look no further.<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><br/>Project Clockwork will have a big focus on progression systems to unlock new gadgets such as engineering, farming, cooking, blacksmithing, combat and more!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It also features a robust equipment system where you can find different armor pieces that will grant you special bonuses.</strong></p>\n<strong>The townsfolk are also a really big part of this game and will serve as tutors, friends and workers. Each individual will have his own backstory, desires and quests. What stories are you going to uncover ?</strong>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Every month I upload new videos detailing new mechanics and challenges I am facing as a game developer. I also upload time-lapse videos for new characters introduced and AMAs every once in a while.</strong><br/>\n\n\n<p><strong>If you want to keep up with development and have an insight into how a game is made, feel free to check out my YouTube\u00a0channel and subscribe.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Alongside the Devlogs, I also have a Trello Board with the individual tasks I'm working for the game, as well as the more broad mechanics that are planned for the following months. You can check the Trello clicking on the button down below.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With Project Clockwork, I want to nurture a community of people that also believe in this project and want to share their ideas to help the game become the best it can be.\u00a0 For that, I made a discord server where people can discuss about the game and share what they think. Be a part of the community by clicking the button down here.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<strong>After I finish college at the end of this year, I plan on working on this game Full time and invest money into its development with time saving plugins, soundtrack and sound effects.\u00a0</strong>\n<p><strong>If you want to support development while also getting access to:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Latest playable version</strong></li><li><strong>Exclusive sneak peek shorter videos on mechanics and items as soon as they are made.</strong></li><li><strong>Exclusive roles and patron-only chats for the Discord server</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Then feel free to support me on Patreon. Every dollar is of great help and will make the project a lot better.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>As a 100 Dollar goal, I will also start making Livestreams where I work on the game's models, mechanics, items, etc.</strong></p>\n\n<br/>\n\n<strong>Frequently asked Questions</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>Will Project Clockwork have multiplayer ?</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>I am studying the possibility of adding Co-op Multiplayer early on so that future mechanics programmed for the game can have multiplayer in mind from the get go. Multiplayer is not guaranteed, but it is going to be focused during development as well.<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Is there a roadmap for the game?</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>I am using a Trello board as a way of keeping track of tasks and future goals. The link can be found on the Devlogs section.</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>When will the game come out\u00a0?</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>The game is currently under pre-production, so it will take at least 3 more years before the game is done.</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Do you accept volunteers ?</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Not for the project itself, but I really enjoy hearing about ideas you might have and concept art that you can create for the game. Join the discord server to get in touch.</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>What platforms will the game release on?</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>The game will be releasing on Steam and Itch.io.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>In the future there is a possibility that the game can be released on other platforms as well.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Will the game have community or mod support ?</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Most likely yes, but that is not a priority during this early stage in development.</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Will there be player customization ?</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Yes. I have yet to implement a full system\u00a0with more in depth customization with female models, but that is definitely going to be a big focus during development.</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Is the game going to have Quests/ Main Story?</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Yes. The game will be oriented towards open ended gameplay, so a lot of the content will be available for you to pursue as you see fit. The possibility of a Main storyline is planned as well.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:13:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed669071ef9938b7b1beecd14463017f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Logic Leo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
