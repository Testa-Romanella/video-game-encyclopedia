{"id": 95969, "slug": "midnight-fields", "name": "Midnight Fields", "name_original": "Midnight Fields", "description": "<p>\r\n\t Midnight Fields was made in about a month for the Finally Finish Something game jam, and was originally released in January 2017. It's a fast paced top-down shooter, with an ammo mixing system that results in many possible weapon combinations. It also features rising difficulty, random level sequences and procedural poems.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t This game was made for FFSjam, and the theme of the jam was to finish something you've been working on for a long time. This game had gone through more than 30 different prototypes and versions over a number of years, and we just never seemed to get it finished. We hosted the FFSjam ourselves to help other devs with this exact problem, and we were also able to get this project finished at long last.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\tIt's a fairly traditional top-down shooter, controller in a twin-stick on the gamepad, or with WASD and Mouse. It also supports various European keyboard layouts. The controls are all explained in-game.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe ultimate aim of the game is based around beating your high score, so there is no set ending, the game will just continue to get harder as you progress. Each level has 5 skulls hidden somewhere, and once you find these the exit door will appear. Get to the exit door quickly, and don't try to destroy the big spinning head - they are practically invincible and won't stop chasing you until you leave!\r\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>ADAM</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; HUD\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>NOTE: Procedural Poems Provided by Pete</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/13980732d8dd9eab55fa99792b2764b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
