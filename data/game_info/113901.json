If there is too many criminals out of jail and on the loose, then your city's population decreases, but there's only so much jail space so manage your criminals smartly and <strong>don't run out of space</strong>. Try to keep your population above 0 for as long as possible!</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Look at wealth Status</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0poor can afford no more than $100-$500 fines, middle class can afford $1000-$2500, rich can afford $3000-5000</li><li><strong>Pay attention to population decrease</strong> - Each criminal has a population decrease based off their crime.
