But now it&#39;s got a 2 in front of it!<br />\nRogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical Rogue-LITE.  That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs.  In this game, the grind is optional.  Play well and you can dive deeper into the depths of the ever-changing world.  Or don&#39;t!  Who cares!  With hardcore platforming mixed with a deep RPG system, everyone can win eventually.<br />\n...And really, isn&#39;t having that kind of choice the best? &lt;3<br />\nHere&#39;s what Rogue Legacy 2 IS:<br />\nA procedurally generated adventure.  The entire kingdom changes with every life, so no two runs are the same.<br />\nRogue-LITE.  Build your manor, improve your legacy, and make each child stronger than the last.  The game can be beaten at level 1, but that doesn&#39;t mean it has to.<br />\nUniversal Healthcare.  Every child is unique.  Some might have Synethesia, others might be a pacifist, and some could just be a little chubby.  Through the powers of Socialism, traits which have more debilitating effects on gameplay now give gold bonuses!<br />\nCastle Permanence.  It&#39;s a rogue-like where bosses stay dead.<br />\nEvery class (and there&#39;s a lot!) now have their own unique set of armaments.  Take down foes from afar with your bow as the nimble Ranger, or get up and close with the massive Battleaxe as the Barbarian.<br />\nStack Runes.  Runes can now stack to infinity.  It&#39;ll take a while, but if you wanted to have penta jump, and lifesteal, and hyperspeed you can!<br />\nAND THERE&#39;S A WHOLE LOT MORE.  But we&#39;re working on it, and we&#39;d still like to keep a few secrets in our back pocket. :)<br />\nThis store page may be temporary, but Rogue Legacy is forever!</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-14T23:08:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/776/776ebcf6f05c98eab89af736e6f38283.jpg", "website": "http://www.roguelegacy2.com/", "rating": 4.02, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 54, "owned": 724, "beaten": 62, "toplay": 117, "dropped": 63, "playing": 44}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 58, "ratings_count": 136, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 137, "platforms": ["Xbox Series S/X", "Xbox One", "PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Cellar Door Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cellar Door Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
