My son (11) took on design\u00a0and my daughter (8) took on art, while I provided all the code. Our ambitions quickly outstripped our ablity to deliever on them, so my wife convinced us to scale back and make a shorter demo game. This is that demo, currently very unpolished.</p>\n<p>The plan is to add polish to this demo over the coming months, and if interest continues past that, to try making something a little larger.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T08:52:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82e/82e1c49ec4ac5891b270253b94228b3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kalevtait"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
