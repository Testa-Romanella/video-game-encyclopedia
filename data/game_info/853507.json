(sorry if that sounds tacky) Finally, I have made a neat and playable version of this game and I wanted to release it to the world if I get enough support I want to make expansions, boxed sets and maybe even spin-off games so grab your sword and some dice and\u00a0I hope you have a good quest.</p>\n\n<p>PS: i tried to make the monsters look as similar as the original so they might look a bit weird</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T11:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/030/0300edb2f442a84b41ffbc1e26a7426d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zendon180"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
