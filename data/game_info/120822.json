This is a little dress up game I made as part of Xpace's Images Fest in Toronto, Ontario. Curated by Adrienne Crossman, the theme was non-binary in a binary world. This game is a queer response to character creation screens in culturally relevant video games. Avatar creation in video games has a tendency to be very limited, and as a result can be very alienating to those who don't fit the mould. This project is specifically addressing the limitations on gender expression in video games. I would have liked to address more, but ran out of time/am too much of a n00b to figure it all out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OLEANDRIN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
