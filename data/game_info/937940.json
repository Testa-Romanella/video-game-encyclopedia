It's going to be a fast paced multiplayer(with singleplayer gamemode) shooter with a lot of focus on keeping velocity, jumping and not stopping. Health management is also going to be a core mechanic, as the lower health you have the harder you'll be to spot, so it might sometimes be beneficial to have low health.</p>\n<p>Note: Still very much a prototype and WIP. It's also being developed in the spare time of a 13 year old with limited unity experience, so please keep that in mind when giving feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T20:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a61/a61ae77edb1578d0facf5c6a7f7a06e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["BragosMagos"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
