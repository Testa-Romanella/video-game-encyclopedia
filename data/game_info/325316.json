From the Big Leagues to Little League, coaches and parents count the number of pitches thrown during every game and each bullpen session.  Most leagues even have strict pitch counts that each pitcher must adhere to on a game-to-game basis.  While knowing how many pitches your pitcher threw is important, knowing where these pitches are being thrown is vital in measuring your pitchers progress.  This, along with many other features, is what separates this application from all other training tools developed for pitchers.<br/> <br/>Spend more time improving your pitcher's accuracy and consistency and less time recording data. pitcherStats is flexible to facilitate any situation; game or training.

I could look back on three training sessions and see his improvement in locating his fastball and change-up.
