After my previous 7DRL stealth entry \"Skyrogue\" was more of a puzzle game, this time decided to try and actually get as much of classic thief-like gameplay into\u00a0 a procedurally generated roguelike game!</p>\n<p>Map gen is fairly simple, but gives a good array of challenges.\u00a0 Likely isn't balanced properly at higher ranks and I'm entirely positive the level generation can break in interesting ways but *most* of the time it gives pretty decent results!</p>\n<p>As always a tonne of stuff ended up on the cutting room floor.\u00a0 Stuff that didn't make it in that was planned:</p>\n<ul><li>Different mission types (assassinations, capture, steal % of loot etc)</li><li>Special Abilities and tools (teleport,\u00a0traps, disguises etc)</li><li>Moving unconscious guards</li><li>Multiple floors</li><li>A Shop for buying equipment (Giving gold a use other than score)</li><li>Rep system (take contracts for certain houses against other houses etc)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T11:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbb164b920f85c06d256cb3e1258328f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["DragonXVI"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
