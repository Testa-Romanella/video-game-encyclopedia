Apologies for the horrible sounds haha I ran out of time and made them in 10 minutes just to get some kind of sound in there.</p>\n<p>Had lots of fun in blender with this one.\u00a0 This is only my second attempt at a 3d game. I did hope to do more but as always I over scoped!</p>\n<p>The Linux and Apple version are untested.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Click to zoom in on a planet.</p>\n<p>Right click while zoomed to zoom out to see the whole discovered universe.</p>\n<p>Be careful not to hit the right click straight after zoooming starts. This can bug out. Didn't have time to fix this.</p>\n<p>If there is a tooltip that is staying visible when it shouldn't, just put your mouse over another part of the UI.</p>\n<p>Left Click to place a build or resource.</p>\n<p>Left click on a hut or mine to allocate civilians as workers.</p>\n<p>Use the mouse wheel to rotate buildings and resources (its a bit buggy. The higher you are on a planet the faster the rotation)</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to rotate the planet.</p>\n<p>Hover over UI elements for tooltips</p>\n<p>Once you have build something it cannot be deleted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:30:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bf/1bff00439d1cfd105fc082e0c2c737c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["stumpybean"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
