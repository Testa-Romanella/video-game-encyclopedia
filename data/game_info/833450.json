The &quot;Cancer&quot; was not affected by the weapons that human beings had produced so far, and human beings who had no way to repel were defeated. The land was abandoned and various nations disappeared into the war. Most of the land is now under the control of &quot;Cancer&quot;.</p>\n<p>When humanity had little time left and was prepared for extinction, a new weapon was developed. That is the decisive battle weapon &quot;Seraph&quot;. Only those equipped with it could effectively hit the &quot;Cancer&quot;. Mankind gathered those who had the skills to manipulate &quot;Seraph&quot; and established the Seraph unit with the last hope. Those who could manipulate the &quot;Seraph&quot; had one thing in common. Being girls with some talent.<br />\nKayamori Tsukiuta is one of them. She also puts herself into the fight with Cancer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-29T09:07:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/131/131620d21a68b0ec6bc120c04118003f.jpg", "website": "https://heaven-burns-red.com/", "rating": 2.43, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 178, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["VisualArts/Key", "WFS"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["WFS"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
