Try and survive as long as you can!</p>\n<p>The blue squares are the remains of other helpless souls. They waste out their days lazily floating along.</p>\n<p>The yellow circles attack you directly, but move methodically, and mass together into unstoppable blobs! Lure them into the gravity pulses to clear them out in large chunks!</p>\n<p>The red triangles are viruses that charge at you! Dodge them and take advantage of their poor turning!</p>\n<p>The gravity pulses are your only offense, but be warned: every time you use one, the next one takes longer to spawn.
