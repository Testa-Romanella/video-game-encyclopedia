If i had more time id make some animations/alternate sprites for damaged parts as well as for hits with the laser. I would also have liked to give more options for what parts to sacrifice, areas to jump to as well as expand the combat system, but oh well, doesnt matter too much now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you all for checking out my first entry to Ludum Dare, I know the code base is a disaster and if I were to do this again id do it completely differently, but hindsight 20/20 and sometimes in the moment you just do something despite it being a stupid way to do it.</p>\n<p>Suggestions and feedback is welcome!</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Linux and MAC OS builds are NOT tested at all</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/428050189b6ce5de611757a5e7d8a1dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["OlavDeng2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
