I think. It's <strong>definitely </strong>a fan game and it <strong>definitively </strong>falls well within the purview of the jam. I'm a big fan of Satan, after all (I was listening to Aphrodite's Child's('s's's) <em>666</em> while making it, if that helps).\u00a0Enjoy.</p>\n<p>It's quite primitive as far as these kinds of things go; I mostly made it to see what one could do on bitsy. Turns out, you can do quite a lot of things with it.</p>\n<p>Oh, and there's some nudity in there, somewhere. You might also want to turn down your volume. Enjoy.
