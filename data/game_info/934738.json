In doing so, my main goal was to create levels that become progressively harder. To accomplish this, I added enemies to both levels, and in the third level I increased enemy speed to add difficulty. Additionally, I adapted the environment of the game to make it much harder to navigate throughout the levels. I was also able to fix my original mistake of making all of the levels accessible, so they are now able to be accessed through the main menu, level progress, and level select. I believe the assumption of new and stronger enemies, hazardous environment, and the overall addition of the new levels helps this game become well rounded, exciting, and still very playable. \u00a0</p>\n<p>I just realized that I had made my original submission for the 2D shooter trial was restricted and not made public. I have now adjusted that to public. Now both games should be fully completed with no issues at all!\u00a0I hope that I can retain credit for these as I worked very hard on them.</p><p>Credit: Jacob Woebkenberg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T08:06:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a48/a487e22aa887522f74685aeace0f8fbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jweb23"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
