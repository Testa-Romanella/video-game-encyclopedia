You need a pole to have the strength to move boxes and rocks, but it can also get in your way sometimes.</p>\n<p>Created for Mini Jam 65 over a weekend. My first game jam, of course\u00a0I wasn't able to finish everything I\u00a0had planned. Core gameplay and programming done, but some animations, textures, and additional levels had to be cut.</p>\n<p>With the \"Abandoned\" theme the main idea I\u00a0had was you had to pickup some kind of tool or powerup to solve part of the puzzle, but that would later hinder you and you'd need to leave it behind. That is only playing a piece of the total solutions here. I\u00a0think there are more interesting interactions between the other pieces on the board. With more time you could imagine expanding the levels into several combinations of what you see in the few levels here.</p>\n<p>The screen shake limitation was simple. Camera never moves.</p>\n<p>V2 uploaded after game jam completed. Fixed bug where pressing 2 directions quickly together caused an exception inside LeanTween, which made your player permanently disappear. Turned off exception throwing on release build and put in quick check for NaN.</p><p>Windows version untested.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:54:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a77/a77d7064a3d7af33af359b164496c604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gameburke"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
