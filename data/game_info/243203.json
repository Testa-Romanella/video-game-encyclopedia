Your task is to make the green cube touch 2 seconds of the lilac platform. To do this, you need to make geometric shapes into smaller parts. The difficulty is that you are given only 20 points of action and for each segmentation or removal of the figure one point is wasted, after which you will lose. You also need to make sure that the green cube does not fall down. For each level there are a huge number of tactics for segmentation and deletion, some work, some do not. Play with physics, count it, use your intellect to pass the levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Different levels<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Interesting gameplay<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Beautiful physics <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Minimalistic graphics<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Pleasant musical accompaniment", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f06/f06fe6627a82b59ccce0a5bb186dfdb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mirain Mainklain"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mirain Mainklain"], "esrb_rating": null}
