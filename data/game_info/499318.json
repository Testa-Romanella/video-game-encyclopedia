Season 1", "description": "<p>Message from the developer:<br />\nWell, no more screwing around. It&#39;s time for the full NSFW game!<br />\nThere are two descriptions waiting for you down below. One is short, and the other one contains all the interesting details. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy our (PixelGreeds + HarDDeer) game!<br />\nInspired by anime like &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, I decided to make a game about a bad magician, but a good person, who by the will of fate gets into different funny and sometimes dangerous situations.<br />\nYou&#39;re a Spellbreaker. And in order to &quot;break&quot; the Arcane fever, you have to understand its cause. To do that, you need to get all the information you can, study the area, and find the right approach to a patient.<br />\nDuration: The average duration of Season 1 is around 3 hours.<br />\nMy goal was to make the game packaged with maximum content, and at the same time to avoid artificially stretching the gameplay, by NOT including such things as: grind, pixel hunting, rare CGIs, etc.<br />\nYou play as an unskilled magician who helps people curing them from the mysterious and dangerous &quot;Arcane fever&quot;.<br />\nUnlike other &quot;Spellbreakers&quot;, you do not know how to feel magic, so your approach is a little different from the traditional.<br />\nOn your journey you&#39;ll come across a lot of different girls with their unique personalities, problems, wishes and fetishes.<br />\nIn any endeavor, it is important to understand when to be calm, gentle and neat, and when to be assertive, confident, and even a little aggressive.<br />\nThe right choice of runes will allow you to succeed not only in magic, but also in love. ;)<br />\n-Comics/manga style.<br />\nH-scenes are an interactive comic book that requires using runes and different items.<br />\n-Girls<br />\n70+ unique panels. And 150+ total CGIs.<br />\n-Dialogues:<br />\nThe text and the story are very important parts of the game. You&#39;ll have to properly asses the situation and choose the right solution.<br />\nCharacters depicted in this game are 21 years of age or older.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-24T15:25:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/132/132c310291717337296b530ff756af00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 24, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelGreeds", "HarDDeer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["PixelGreeds"], "esrb_rating": null}
