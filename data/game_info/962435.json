{"id": 962435, "slug": "mixed-unit-tactics", "name": "Mixed Unit Tactics", "name_original": "Mixed Unit Tactics", "description": "Mixed Unit Tactics is a strategy game in which you tactically command a mixed group of units. Use each of your units' unique strengths intelligently to efficiently dispatch your enemies. <br/><br/><strong>Build Your Units</strong><br/><br/>Your units' stats will grow depending on the equipment they use. All units can equip any of the 7 default weapon types, which include swords, axes, spears, bows, light tomes, dark tomes, and staves. They can also equip any of the 3 armor types to protect them from either magic damage, physical damage, or a bit of both. Drag and drop equipment in the pre-battle menu to change your units' equipment.<br/><br/>Want a unit to be a walking tank who hits like a truck? Equip them with a greataxe and heavy armor to maximize the rate at which their strength, HP, and defense grow as they level up. Just watch out for enemies wielding magic, and you'll be fine.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not only do a unit's stats grow as they level up, so do their weapon ranks, allowing them to use stronger versions of a particular type of weapon. If a unit has a sufficiently high weapon rank in two different weapon types, they will be able to use hybrid weapons which have some unique traits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Greatswords are a hybrid between swords and axes. They allow a unit to use a special type of attack that deals damage to up to 3 enemies at once.<br/>Poleaxes are a hybrid between spears and axes. They do bonus damage to units wearing heavy armor, while maintaining the defensive bonuses all spears have.<br/>Javelins are a hybrid between swords and spears. They can attack at distance, allowing your units to contend with other ranged weapon users.<br/>Shadow Tomes are a hybrid between light and dark tomes. They heal the user for a percentage of the damage they deal.<br/>Magic Bows are a hybrid between bows and staves. They allow a unit to deal magic damage at even longer ranges than they could with a tome.<br/><br/><strong>Mounts</strong><br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will acquire one of each of the three types of mounts. First is the Courser, which allows a unit to move 1 more tile per turn than the other two types of mounts. Next is the Pegasus, which allows a unit to fly over terrain that is normally impassable, as well as preventing them from being slowed down by rough terrain. Last is the eloquently named Heavy Horse, which help prevent its rider from being weighed down by heavy equipment.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T03:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d94/d94ad0ac9aae78e827e0c051e5e27b22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Egg Loaf Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Egg Loaf Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
