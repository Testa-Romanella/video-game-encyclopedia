Explore the massive desert to find secrets or find the biggest sand dunes known to man to ride down them at speeds of light on your toboggan.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What Is The Desert?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I created The Desert due to my recent trip to Moreton Island over the holidays. During that time, I got to experience 'The Desert,' a place covered in massive sand dunes that you could toboggan down. After getting the requirements for the assignment 'Leaving your Fingerprints,' I knew I had to make a game about sand to tobogganing to see if I could capture the beauty of tobogganing down massive sand dunes within a video game. Enjoy :) P.S Thank you Hydration Station for always being there &lt;3</p>\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Tobogganing</p>\n<p>Exploration for Secrets</p>\n<p>Multiple Game Modes\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controller completely supported</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Keyboard &amp; Mouse:</strong></em></p>\n<p>WASD = Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse = Camera rotation</p>\n<p>Space = Toboggan mode</p>\n<p><em><strong>Controller:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Left joystick = MovementRight</p>\n<p>joystick = Camera rotation</p>\n<p>A = Toboggan mode</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76f0d571f5fcd855bed3cc51d4dceb12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jaden Romilio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
