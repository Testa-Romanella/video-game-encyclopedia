Once you have reviewed their background, you have a determined amount of time before they die. You must complete all of the operations before that happens. If you succeed, they live. Otherwise, this generation of your AI is shut down and tuned before you are given the next person to operate on. This causes your generation counter to go up.</p>\n<p>There are currently six operations: Heart, Lung, Kidney, Artery, Brain, and Bone. Each has it's own unique method of being repaired.</p><p>Note: This project is designed for mobile play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T05:44:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36f/36f7633666c2b80286cc259080070263.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gmanicus"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
