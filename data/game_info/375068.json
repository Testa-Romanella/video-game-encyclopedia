The theme was \"Afterlife\". Sorry for making it edgy it's not my style at all, hahahaha</p>\n<p>I wish i could have worked more on this, added sounds and more graphics, but the jam got me on a weekend where i had to travel and do quite a bunch of stuff so i barely could work on it. I hope it was enough though!</p>\n<p>It's a bit edgy and dark and honestly i don't think i'm a good writer at all and barely have any practice but it was really fun to do! Hope you people like it.</p><p>Take it more as an experiment, heheh</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T05:39:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/756a24f6c8088f1911ed6c45d1150b2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stopsignal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
