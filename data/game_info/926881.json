For example, a clue of \"4 8 3\" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive sets.<br/><br/>*** Features ***<br/>\u25cf Hand crafted beautiful pixel arts<br/>\u25cf There are various topics to have fun with<br/>\u25cf Using hint can help you in difficult time<br/>\u25cf Easy controls, either using drag or d-pad<br/>\u25cf Mindfulness, relaxing music<br/>\u25cf Playing session is saved/resumed automatically<br/>\u25cf Don\u2019t forget to using Mark (X) to solve the puzzle easier<br/><br/>*** Strategy ***<br/>Simpler puzzles can usually be solved by a reasoning on a single row only (or a single column) at each given time, to determine as many boxes and spaces on that row as possible. Then trying another row (or column), until there are no rows that contain undetermined cells.<br/><br/>Some more difficult puzzles may also require several types of \"what if?\" reasoning that include more than one row (or column). This works on searching for contradictions:\u00a0When a cell cannot be a box, because some other cell would produce an error, it will definitely be a space. And vice versa.\u00a0Advanced solvers are sometimes able to search even deeper than into the first \"what if?\" reasoning. It takes, however, a lot of time to get some progress.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T08:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/068/068348a2cecc1455d507dbe2c61d05c1_P4UB5eD.jpg", "website": "http://pixeption.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nguyen Loc"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nguyen Loc"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
