With a damaged stillsuit, even more so.\u00a0In just a few short minutes, you will collapse to the ground as the desert takes the water from your body, but be wary of going to quickly. Throughout the desert are the <em>shai-hulud </em>-- sandworms of enormous size. Walking in a consistent patter draws them to you, so sandwalking is the only way to cross the desert.\u00a0\u00a0You are a so close to your <em>sietch</em>, but will you make it?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Instructions:\u00a0</p>\n<p>To move: Follow the random prompts of WASD inputs. Inputting the incorrect one will further alert the sandworms to your location.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have 2 minutes to follow the marker and make it to the <em>sietch</em>. Good luck, my friend!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Dev notes:\u00a0</p>\n<p>The prompt for this project was \"Survive.\" Having recently watched and reread\u00a0<em>Dune</em>, it seemed appropriate to make a game in that universe.\u00a0 As the fremen face\u00a0the threat of water and the\u00a0<em>shai-hulud</em>, it matches the theme quite well. The worm is a custom model with a custom rig. It only has the one animation (made in the blend space and a time line in UE4), but this is compensated by\u00a0\u00a0the 14 bone custom rig for the fremen player character.\u00a0\u00a0The animation for the fremen character took a long while to make as I had trouble with the weights. At one point, I tried to use the weight paint feature in Blender, and it destroyed part of the mesh.\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately though, it is finally done. Thank you for your patience!\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T23:08:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/592/592f4b2e6defa90f1863235f72035268.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YeOldeGent"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
