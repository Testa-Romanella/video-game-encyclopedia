{"id": 361838, "slug": "bulwark-in-the-city-of-flesh", "name": "Bulwark in the City of Flesh", "name_original": "Bulwark in the City of Flesh", "description": "<p>Half a millennium ago, the people of my planet realized we were drifting toward the event horizon of a black hole. If that seems like a slow-motion apocalypse to you, imagine how many years passed for your planet in the meantime. We experienced generations of denial, despair, riots, and war before Earth was even a wet rock.<br/></p>\n<p>I was born after the dust settled, and I grew up knowing this: Someday, our planet will reach the black hole, and then everything we've experienced and created will be destroyed. In a way, it never existed at all.</p>\n<p>You might think life was super grim for us, but the thing is, there's a hierarchy to problem solving. You don't focus on cosmic catastrophe. You focus on what you can control.</p>\n<p>Or, at least, what you think you can control.<br/></p>\n<p>\u2013Priscilla</p>\n\n<p><em>Bulwark in the City of Flesh</em> is an <strong>audio game</strong>, a <strong>video game</strong>, and a <strong>radio drama</strong>. It can be played with your ears, your eyes, or both.</p>\n\r\nAudio Game\r\n<p>If you choose to play the audio game, the screen is blank throughout. In this mode, stereo headphones and a 4x8 grid of keys are required. The keys are mapped on first launch.</p>\n\r\nVideo Game\r\n<p>Alternatively, you may choose to play <em>Bulwark in the City of Flesh</em> as a video game. In this mode, the game is a mix of visual and nonvisual scenes, all of which are fully playable without audio if subtitles are enabled.</p>\n\r\nRadio Drama\r\n<p><em>Bulwark in the City of Flesh</em> is partially a radio drama, which means you\u2019ll often be an observer while audio-only scenes play out around you. If you\u2019re not a fan of noninteractive experiences of that sort, you may wish to sit this one out. If you like the concept but, like many people, struggle to focus when you don't know what to do with your eyes, it may help to turn on subtitles. Some players like to go the other way and close their eyes\u2014or even put on a blindfold.<br/></p>\n\r\nAudio Trailers\r\n\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\r\nVideo Trailers\r\n\r\n\n\n<p> <br/></p>\n\r\nNotes\r\n<p>If you experience poor performance with the default graphics settings, hold the Alt/Option key after double-clicking the .exe/.app/.x86_64 file (before the game launches).
