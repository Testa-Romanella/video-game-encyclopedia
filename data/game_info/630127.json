And Harry is always in a hurry!</p>\n<p>So hurry up to get all 3 different levels done!</p>\n<p><strong>GameJam and Idea:</strong></p><p>\"Game\" created for \"minibeansjam7\" with the theme \"not enough time\". So the idea of this game ist to have a timer (60 seconds) to manage the tasks in each level. To have some variety, each level is completely different. If you make one mistake, you have to restart the level.</p><p>https://itch.io/jam/minibeansjam7</p>\n<p><strong>Levels:</strong></p><ol><li>Math equations: What is X?</li><li>On which side of the earth is the named country?</li><li>Pick the right icon!</li></ol><p><strong>Engine:</strong></p><p>Completely done in MS PowerPoint (M365) and no macros were used! The focus was on some cool animations and some variety. The animations for each level are the same and are polished, so it is really easy to expand the game with new levels.</p><p>Extra work went into\u00a0really many\u00a0triggers for the tons of\u00a0animations (especially level 2). False answers have to lead to fail slides with restart button.<br/></p><p><strong>Start animation:</strong></p><p><strong>Fail animation:</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T15:53:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b46/b462528ab4b7f335f4b5569609295708.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["johnconnor008"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
