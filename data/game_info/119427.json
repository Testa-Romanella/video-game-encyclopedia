Ever the practically-minded man, Noah points out a few flaws with this plan, and so by divine power he is cloned, forming the basis of the Noah Shipping Company.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTake the helm on a multitude of arks, flinging animals back and forth between your ship and your partner's in order to form pairs. Once the boat is full, swipe to bring in a new one. Save as many animal species as you can, and remember that you're working co-operatively!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db5/db5849a70af227acdd61e68e70bcef00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Gemma Thomson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
