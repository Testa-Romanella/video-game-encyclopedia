You <em>could </em>also use a keyboard. You <em>could </em>also play it alone, in the dark, sad, but I highly recommend that you grab a friend or train an animal to play this with because it actually hurts my head to try to control two lovebugs at the same time.</p>\r\nWhat's a \"Lovebug\"?\r\n<p>Lovebugs are indigenous little creeps  friends\u00a0that come around every summer in the south.\u00a0They're a little cute...\u00a0They attach butts together, and buzz around.</p>\r\nControls (Gamepad Recommended):\r\nPlayer1 (Purple):\u00a0Left Trigger/Left CTRL to Dash. Left Stick/\"A\",\"D\" to move.\r\nPlayer2 (Green): Right\u00a0Trigger/Right CTRL to Dash. Right\u00a0Stick/Arrow Keys to move.\r\n\n<p><em>This was my first game made entirely with C#, so I'm pretty hyped about that &lt;3\u00a0</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T18:18:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a2205136fd1a4f15a8658dbf3e025570.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SugarSores"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
