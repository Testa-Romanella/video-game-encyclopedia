Once you get to grips with that it is just a case of shooting everything! Unless of course you are playing in pacifist mode.</p>\n<p>There  are three game modes:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Classic mode</strong> - shoot asteroids and space ships</li><li><strong>Power up mode</strong> - Classic mode but with triple shot and shield pickups (who doesn't like triple shot?)</li><li><strong>Pacifist mode</strong> - Check yer guns at the door pardner, there will be no shootin' in this here game mode</li></ul>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update 1.5:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Tweaked a few bits and pieces</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Update X:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Added Rainbow and Fruit version and uploaded the HTML5 version of R&amp;F, I only just dropped out the HTML5 version and it is a little slow, but gives you a taste of what to expect from the full game, if you find anything horrible and buggy let me know.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Update 1.3:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Tweaked the graphics and the difficulty slightly (capped the asteroids and enemy ships again)</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Update 1.2:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Made the buttons and title slightly prettier</em></p>\n<p><em>tweaked the game play a little more (you can shoot enemy bullets now)</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Update 1.1:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Just a quick update to add increasing difficulty in all game modes.</em></p>\n<p>Drop me a note on twitter at @spiritek or email and let me know what you think</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b0606e891b94c1013f08c65d35b859b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spiritek"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
