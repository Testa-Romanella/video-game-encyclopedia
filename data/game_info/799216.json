Report any issues or bugs and give us any feedback you have! We'll be happy to answer any questions or help if you are stuck on a level. <br/></p>\r\nInferno\r\n<p>A 3D platform style adventure/puzzle game. Bune is a lonely soul who feels he has been wronged in being put into hell. The game takes you through his attempted escape from the Inferno onto his path towards a better _after_life.</p>\n<p>The theme was 'Death is only the beginning'. We took the meaning in two instances, the story is based around a character escaping hell, so he is already dead but his journey has just begun. The second instance is in the rebirth mechanic that is used throughout the game. </p>\r\nNotes\r\n<p>This is our first game jam, the first time any of us have finished a game and was the first time some of us have even touched Unity, it has been a hell of a 10 days, and we've gained a great wealth of knowledge. This really has been a labour of love and we hope that that comes through while you play. The game, as you maybe have guessed, is far from in a state ready for a commercial release, so expect bugs and issues. The rebirth mechanic will reset you back to the level if you fall or get pooped out (yes, it's a real problem), otherwise, the pause menu [esc] has a 'reset' button to start any level again. You can also go back to the main menu at any time and select a different level to start on.</p>\n<p>We understand that you may encounter some issues during gameplay, we are fully aware of a number of bugs and have issues opened to track them as we fix them. Feel free to join us on discord (link at the top!) and raise any bugs or issues to our attention so we can get them sorted for you! </p>\n<p>There can be some tricky spots in the game so here are a few tips to help you have the best experience possible:</p>\n<ul><li>It is possible to squeeze through some of the walls, which will bring you outside the map. It's probably best that you don't try to force yourself through walls. You can just hit [e] to bring you back to the respawn point if you do fall out.</li><li>It's fairly common to get a box stuck in a corner, if you just keep bumping into it, it will likely eventually come free so you can get it in the hole, otherwise restarting the level might be in order. </li><li>\u00a0In levels 7 and 8, it is possible to make the level impossible to complete, we are aware of this and have it as a high priority item to sort out. If you find yourself unable to complete the level, you just need to restart we are afraid to say. </li><li>\u00a0Jumping works best if you jump from a little further away from the block that you are jumping onto, as there is friction and the physics can get weird, here's an image describing the solution</li></ul>\n\r\nReleases\r\n<p>v0.0.1 - Initial release for game jam\u00a0 [29/5/2022]</p>\n<p>v0.0.2 - Hotfix for UI issues once uploaded<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n\n<p>Code:\u00a0 DeadZed +\u00a0Eacaw</p>\n<p>Graphics Design: DeadZed + DysDysDys <br/></p>\n<p>3D Design: Eacaw <br/></p>\n<p>Audio Design: Eacaw</p>\n<p>Total 3\u00a0contributors eligible for the free course.
