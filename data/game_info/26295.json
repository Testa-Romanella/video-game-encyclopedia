He is \n      determined to return to his rightful place in the universe and become a \n      bright star. Take control of Aura-Aura, and help him to accomplish this \n      by using his grapple arm to grab a variety of grapple points and \n      continuously climb higher in the sky. Along the way, collect items to \n      aid him (bombs, extensions for his grapple arm) and avoid enemies that \n      damage Aura-Aura\u2019s health. Two modes of play offer very different \n      challenges: Score Attack, in which you try to get to the goal with as \n      many points as possible, and Endless, in which your aim is simply to \n      help Aura-Aura climb as high into the sky as possible within the time \n      limit. And even if you think you\u2019ve mastered the art of climbing, both \n      modes offer numerous medals to find or earn by completing specific \n      tasks. With its intuitive controls, straight forward game play, and \n      incredible replay value, Aura-Aura\u2019s journey is arcade-style gaming at \n      its best...or should that be its highest?\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a3bc6982649717718586902d59ea163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
