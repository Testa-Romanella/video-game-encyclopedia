Play as Gryme as you bully and pillage your way through a world made entirely of slime. No party members, no EXP--nothing to help you overcome this ordeal but sheer spite.\u00a0Fight dirty in a cruel and unusual turn-based battle system, where enemies get stronger as you defeat their cohorts and not waiting for your turn to act is the key to victory.<br/></p>\n<p>This is our very first public release of SLYME BREAKER. As we are still very early in development, this alpha demo focuses entirely on core gameplay and little else.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Z = Select on a menu, Interact in the overworld, Shield and Parry in battle</p>\n<p>X = Cancel on a menu, Bash in the overworld, Volley and Counter in battle</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys = Move cursor on a menu, move Gryme in the overworld, Snatch in battle</p>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS:<br/></p>\n<p>(Will be listed soon!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T10:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/517/517c0de78cebfe9515eb7c28d3b12d24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Recurring Adversaries"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
