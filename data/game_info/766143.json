Click on water directly above, directly below, to the left, or to the right of the player in order to fish. Click again when the screen vibrates and an exclamation point appears to reel in your catch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the left hand side of the screen are 2 tabs - Inventory and Building.</p>\n<p>Inventory allows you to see what you have caught and allows you to eat fish. Keep your hunger up or you'll starve to death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Building allows you to choose objects to place. You'll see a list of materials you can place, and where you can place them.</p>\n<p>You can craft at campfires and workbenches. Not entirely sure if a fire on a raft is a good idea but hey. Click these objects to bring up a menu where you can craft, provided you have enough resources.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play on Scratch:</p>\n<p>https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/669690747/<br/></p><p>The only thing not by me is the music:</p><p>Peppers Theme by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4998-peppers-theme</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T14:07:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/923/923aa5a8775a1760b0b3af956f298031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HannaMouse1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
