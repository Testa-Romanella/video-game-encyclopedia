The final aim of the game is to let the roots reach the invaded planet\u2019s core, destroying it. The way towers and roots can be built is through a shared resource, the tree\u2019s Sap, threatened by the planet\u2019s inhabitants that will try to consume it totally coming in waves from both the tree\u2019s side.</p><p>MADE FOR THE GLOBAL GAME JAM 2023\u00a0 BY</p><p>Andrea Giannoni (dukearena) - DEV\u00a0</p><p>Luca Russo (Balto93) - DEV\u00a0</p><p>Vincenzo di Paola - DEV, Game Designer<br/></p><p>Miriam Martini - Concept artist\u00a0<br/></p><p>Riccardo Mazzieri (dbmaj7) - 3D Artist\u00a0</p><p>Federico Gottini - DEV, Sound Designer\u00a0</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T21:46:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/5165a9456be26ee61575c7a43624726a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tayumaru"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
