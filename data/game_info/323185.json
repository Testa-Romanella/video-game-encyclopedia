No, darling. Those are the <strong>FLAWS</strong>.While other developers try to tempt you with these sweet \u00ab900 endings\u00bb and \u00ab4K hand drawn graphics\u00bb, I am going to be as honest as possible and introduce negative aspects of my game instead. And this is <strong>not only</strong> because it was easier to find flaws rather than features!<br/><ul><li><strong>Literally 0 choices</strong><br/>Absolutely linear storyline!<br/>But, hey, then it means that 100% of your choices matter! Because there are none of them.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Person who did the math for the previous point programmed this game</strong><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Average playtime: 1 hour </strong><br/>Too short? Well, luckily you will get bored much earlier!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>No original content</strong><br/>All game content is based on the Creative Commons and Public Domain resources, found on photostocks. Some parts of the game content were even processed or generated with the use of neural networks!</li></ul>Okay... But maybe there are some <strong>ACTUAL</strong> features?<br/><ul><li><strong>Photorealistic graphics</strong><br/>Graphics are literally cropped photos.</li></ul><br/><ul><li><strong>Believable characters</strong><br/>In attempt to create strong and believable characters with realistic society problems my personal assistant have been bullying me during my school years. And he will continue if you are not mentally bounded with characters yet.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Decently implemented gamepad support</strong><br/>It was quite hard to apply gamepad controls to the 1-button gameplay but I successfully handled it!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67769cbbec77c4a8045af68d5085304.jpg", "website": "https://www.superwebkittens.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kuno Hoshiko"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kuno Hoshiko"], "esrb_rating": null}
