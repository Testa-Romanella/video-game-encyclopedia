The gameplay is quite different from Flappy Bird though as there are options to speed up or slow down swimming, fast-fall and even shoot out little air bubbles to destroy certain obstacles. The game has four difficulties and even one easter egg screen you can try to find, it's a bit of a schizo-post.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T11:13:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20b/20b3c3f6934ea404ee469dc19e2d43d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ZiggyZagga"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
