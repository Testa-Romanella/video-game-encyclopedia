Whenever you pick up a gem, you will have a %60 chance of being cursed. Whenever you get cursed, your character expression changes to some sort of sad face, and your player is messed up in some way. The curses you can have are: Slowed movement, extremely fast movement, dark screen, reversed movement, can only see close to player, and huge jumping.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>WASD to move, M to toggle showing mouse</p>\n<p><strong>TIP: </strong>If you have the huge jumping, probably go towards the right side of the castle.</p>\n<p>Post your score in the comments!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong>Kenney Assets Used (For Kenney Game 2020): Cartography Pack, Scribble Platformer, Particle Pack.
