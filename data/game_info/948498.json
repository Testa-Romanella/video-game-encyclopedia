As a passionate game developer and artist, I have created this 2D endless runner game set in the beautiful Gold Coast, Australia.<br/></p>\n<p>You play as a skater who is racing down the beach walkway with a stunning ocean view in the background. Your objective is to jump over various obstacles while collecting points to increase your score. The farther you go, the faster the game becomes, and the harder it is to avoid obstacles.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is designed to offer a fun and challenging experience with an ambiance that transports you straight to the beautiful beaches of the Gold Coast.</p>\n<p>As a first-time pixel artist and mobile game developer, I'm eager to receive your feedback on this project. I hope you enjoy playing Gold Coast Rush as much as I enjoyed creating it!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T09:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b2d47c1d6d1499feb88653eecf28c55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JvPortal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
