I think I'm gonna make it 2d as making 3d combat requires this thing called \"good animation\". With 2d I think I can get away with simpler animations. The menu and inventory systems are pretty good imo. Pretty simple and I loved adding in the World of Warcraft sound effects.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T04:14:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/491/49172f0fac0a19aa5896e8a166b5bf19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DS Leal"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
