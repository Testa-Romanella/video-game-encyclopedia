Come back in time to the 70s in the early days of Bud Farm where Cheech and Chong have stumbled across a sleepy little town in California. <br/><br/>Cheech and Chong find themselves stranded in the tiny hamlet of Hierba Verde. With nothing to be found, they start their own business, and stumble backwards into a lucrative empire. With the crooked mayor in their back-pocket, the boys are on their way to striking it rich and living out their days lying on a beach like sun-kings. Unfortunately for them, Stadanko is bent on putting them in jail for life. With the help a freaky cast of supporting characters, Cheech and Chong will chase their dreams of fame and fortune, while staying one step ahead of Standanko.<br/><br/>Cheech and Chong Bud Farm is free to download and play, but some game items can be purchased for real money. A network connection is not required, but you will have limited access to in-game functions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:03:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53a/53abac9278b7dc6bb792fe79c111657c_Jv0Rq2t.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/cheechchonggame", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["LDRLY"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["LDRLY"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
