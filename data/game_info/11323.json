Universe Sandbox \u00b2 is the long-awaited sequel to the original Universe Sandbox.<br/><br/>Universe Sandbox \u00b2 includes the desktop version and a VR mode with support for the HTC Vive &amp; Oculus Rift+Touch. This is a free, automatic update.Simulate GravityN-body simulation at almost any speed using Newtonian mechanics. Real science, real physics, no supercomputer required. <br/>Collide Planets &amp; StarsEpic, mind blowing collisions of massive planetary bodies.<br/>Model Earth's ClimateWatch sea ice grow and recede with the seasons because of the tilt of the Earth: change the tilt and change the seasons. Or move the Earth farther from the Sun and freeze the entire planet. <br/>Learn more...<br/>Terraform PlanetsAdd carbon dioxide to a planet's atmosphere to heat it up.
