You obey. You kill... Until they kill you.<br/><br/>The prologue finds you at the City of Ghosts, a once glittering Japanese metropolis, where the tide of battle has clearly turned against you: defeated by an overwhelmingly powerful opponent, you plunge into the darkness below the derelict skyscrapers, only to reawaken and see the familiar reality in a \u201cdifferent light\u201d... But just how real is the world around you?<br/><br/>Learn to survive, relying solely on damaged sensors and the advice of your Tengu mentor. Grow stronger and follow the path of blind rage in the insane and fantastical world of cybernetics and ancient mythology.<h3>\u2014 A world of data and lies</h3>The Mask of the Oni creates a simulation of the world around you, but tread carefully: old data will only show you the deceiving echoes of the past.<br/><h3>\u2014 Swords sing unseen</h3>Even blind, you are unstoppable.
