The Leggites developed martial arts and now live in peace with the local fauna. But the spheroids have turned to organized crime.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their boss, Chunga, uses violent thugs to control his territory and keep a boot on the neck of the local population. Chunga thought he was untouchable. And he might have been.</p>\n<p>But then he decided to mess with Leggette and her family.</p>\n<p>This game features <strong>five missions</strong>. Players have a dynamic set of moves that include a standard kick, a jump kick, and a roll maneuver that can be combined in unique ways to create engaging combat encounters. Players can also pick up two projectile items that further extend combat choices.</p>\n<p>There are seven unique boss battles, multiple enemy types, and an entire alien world to explore and liberate. You are Leggette. Your child has been kidnapped by an evil mob boss. It's time to clean up the streets of Irata.</p>\n<p>*\u00a0* *</p>\n<p>Controls\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0Leggite Luta Livre is\u00a0best played with a controller.</p>\n<p>Directional Pad\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Move Up, Down, Left, and Right</p>\n<p>Select\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Self-destruct (temporary for the beta)</p>\n<p>Start\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Begin Game /\u00a0 Pause</p>\n<p>B\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Standard Kick and Projectile Attack</p>\n<p>A\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Jump Kick /\u00a0Skip Cutscene</p>\n<p>Hold Left/Right + A\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Roll Left or Right (a must for game mastery)</p>\n<p>* *\u00a0*</p>\n<p>Leggite Luta Livre is the fourth in the MULEniverse series, which narratively extends the work of Danielle Bunten Berry's MULE economic simulator game.</p>\n<p>The MULEniverse games include:</p>\n<p>1.\u00a0Wampus</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0Wart Warm Wingding</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0Bat Lizard Bonanza</p>\n<p>4.

You can find one\u00a0here\u00a0or\u00a0here. You can also use any gamepad for a similar experience.</p>\n<p>For really enterprising types, this game is fully playable on an actual NES. You can use either an\u00a0Everdrive, a\u00a0PowerPak, or flash an empty cart, as long as each has\u00a0<strong>mapper 30</strong>\u00a0support.</p>\n<p>*\u00a0*\u00a0*</p>\n<p>Leggite Luta Livre was made possible thanks to\u00a0NESMaker, an engine developed to make NES development more accessible.</p>\n<p>In order to play Leggite Luta Livre, you'll need an NES emulator. I recommend\u00a0FCEUX. Many emulators do not have mapper 30 support, which is the mapper NESMaker uses for its games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you have FCEUX downloaded, start it up and\u00a0open the Leggite_Luta_Livre_Demo.nes ROM. The game should work fine.</p>\n<p><strong>FOR MAC USERS:</strong>\u00a0Download\u00a0OpenEMU\u00a0for Mac. When you open the program, right click on the Nintendo (NES) category on the left hand sidebar and select \"Default Core.\"\u00a0Then select FCEU.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>More from this developer:\u00a0https://johnvanderhoef.itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T06:55:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7e807f843abace3cd4c45e6deb33e26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Vanderhoef"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
