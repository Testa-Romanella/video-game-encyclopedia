{"id": 927429, "slug": "pokemon-yellow-text-edition", "name": "Pokemon Yellow - Text Edition", "name_original": "Pokemon Yellow - Text Edition", "description": "<p>I am attempting to Demake Pokemon Yellow for the Nintendo Game Boy Color as a text adventure created through Harlowe Twine. My goal is to get the computer working properly, have Pokemon added to the game with stats, and the ability for the player to run into wild Pokemon as well as trainers. I would like to at the very least get up to the first gym in Pewter City. I grew up playing Pokemon since the first game's release, so I\u00a0can't think of a more fitting game to try to recreate while I try to improve my skills in Twine.<br/><br/>So far the game has a functioning backpack that just displays how many potions and pokeballs you have, and you can name your player and rival. The first battle is not in this version yet as I still need to create Pikachu and Eevee along with their stats and moves, but otherwise I think this is off to a decent start.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ca/1ca1ccf49f5d161e14b6fde14f3e5e6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sternosaur"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
