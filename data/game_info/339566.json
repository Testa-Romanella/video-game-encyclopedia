A hybrid of top-down adventure games like Zelda and kinetic novels, this game explores intrusive thoughts and obsessive thought patterns in a dreamscape environment. It uses utilizes a glitch-art aesthetic to create a sense of discomfort and, in some cases, create actual glitches within the game. This game will be playable on a web browser and a ROM will be available to play on an actual GameBoy.</p>\n<p>The currently available build is a work-in-progress and the final game will hopefully take about 1 hour to play through. I hope to work with an actual musician to create an ambient soundtrack for the full game.</p>\n<p>The game was built in GB Studio for a gamejam we did at my job. I worked off the starter template to a hang of using the tool, and am excited to build more for the full game.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong>Please make sure your audio is low when playing, the temporary music is... painful.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/795/795bdbc455bd4ec16c81370e04867d01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
