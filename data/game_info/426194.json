Locked up in your house?\u00a0Love regular-style jigsaws but have none around?\u00a0This game is for you.</p>\n<p>I myself fit the above and heard how, because of Covid-19, jigsaw sales are up 400%. Wonder why, if no-one is supposed to leave their house to buy them? Anyways, I made this - it's a mini-game of 5 different jigsaws, from 64 to the 384-whopper. It's nothing fancy and lacks many things you'd find in regular jigsaws. Like, it's all square pieces. But hey, you do get some help in getting the top and bottom rows done, and you get a heck of a lot more exercise in, than you would a normal jigsaw! Some of'em are more than 2 meters high, forces one to stretch for it (or you could just throw the pieces up, that'll work too).</p>\n<p>Room-scale or stationary both work. Seated or not. It's pretty simple - left controller teleports and drags pieces close, right one picks them up and holds them. And is good for throwing them up...<br/><br/>Totally free of charge. If you can spare a buck for a coffee I'll be happy, but absolutely don't sweat it if not, I get by a-okay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Would love to hear from you, in regards to bugs, suggestions for better jigsaws and/or functionality, such stuff. Also just to hear if you liked it/didn't.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, sideload to Oculus Quest, don those bluetooth headphones and your favorite jazz/classical/whatever and get ready for some serious de-stressing. Just remember - there is no progress saving. For now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T02:26:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f1/9f141c884422a119d017d918e38dac5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["harleydk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
