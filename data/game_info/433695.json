In this game you have speed instead of health.\u00a0 If your speed drops too low you will die.\u00a0\u00a0Controls: Use WASD to move.\u00a0 If you go on one of the light blue \"Spin up pads\" you will spin faster.\u00a0 Touching or getting to close to enemies will slow you down.\u00a0 Once you have killed all the enemies you will be able to move up the screen though a gate on to the next level.\u00a0\u00a0Note a wall will kill you faster than any enemy.\u00a0 NOTE: if you want the best playing experience then you should download the windows/mac\u00a0version(sorry linux). Trust me it makes it look so much better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T06:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ea/1ea472149f71bf87a2ef8039eee8edde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["technodragon253"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
