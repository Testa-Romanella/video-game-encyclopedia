{"id": 977566, "slug": "hoofobia", "name": "Hoofobia", "name_original": "Hoofobia", "description": "Hoofobia is the multiplayer deer VS hunter PVP, it\u2019s hilarious to play with friends or strangers. When playing as deer, use stealth &amp; strategy to sneak around vast forests and attack the lone hunter in order to escape his proximity without becoming a wall decoration.<br/><br/>In Hoofobia, the dominance hierarchy is flipped on its head. Stalk the human hunter, strategize with other deer friends, make coordinated assaults on the hunter to knock him over, and finally escape his proximity forcefield before being brutally shot in order to earn a point for the deer team. In order to stay on his feet, the hunter must be more keenly aware than an NFL Linebacker or a Brazilian Spider Monkey, keeping his head on a swivel and closely listening for sneaky deer. <br/><br/>Join global matchmaking lobbies that include 4 players per match and multiple game modes. Game modes include multiple deer vs one hunter or multiple hunters vs one very pissed off deer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-26T08:17:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03cc3537d24c8bc02826f5caf0b30574.jpg", "website": "https://hoofobia.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deathyell Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Deathyell Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
