{"id": 448724, "slug": "counter-clockwise", "name": "Counter Clockwise", "name_original": "Counter Clockwise", "description": "<p>Welcome to this first little project of mine.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay :</p>\n<p>Counter Clockwise is a sort of puzzle game in which you control a little square in its way out of a labyrinth. The only issue is that our little square moves forward and can only turn left. Your goal is to gather correct timing and pathing to get it out of here !</p>\n\n<p>Context :</p>\n<p>Counter Clockwise is not really a game I wanted to create. I am currently learning game development on www.gamecodeur.fr\u00a0and after the first four lessons, I wanted to take a break in the courses, to practice some of what I just learned. This is how I started by moving a simple square and improved it until the current results.</p>\n<p>As it especially was a development practice, I apologize for the poor level design and the lack of levels.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking forward to getting your feedbacks ! Thank you for reading and for playing :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T05:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ef/8ef201913b602f2e7b8deed9e96ce023.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dipsy974"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
