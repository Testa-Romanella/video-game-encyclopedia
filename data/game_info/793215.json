In the puzzle, you have 3 towers, 2 of which are empty and 1 of which has some discs on it.\u00a0The discs are of varying sizes, all ordered smallest to largest\u00a0with the smallest on the top.\r\nYou can move the top disc of one tower to the top of another tower, but only if it doesn't break the rule that every disc must be smaller than all of the discs below it, meaning that the disc you move must be smaller than the top disc of the tower you move it onto.\r\nThe goal of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of discs to another tower, in the same order they were in at the start, which is made difficult by not being allowed to move the stack\u00a0all at once or flip it on its head.\r\nThe game lets you compare your score to the best possible score, for anywhere between 1 - 10 discs (10 discs requiring 1023 moves at best), and has an AI to auto-solve a puzzle as efficiently as possible either from the start or from any possible state you could get it into. The game\u00a0also recognizes whether or not you're on track to complete the puzzle perfectly.\r\nOnly on windows because I'm smooth-brained\u00a0(sorry).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T18:41:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/193/193311bb6b930dc2afb177807391b8fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boogaboogaimatooga"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
