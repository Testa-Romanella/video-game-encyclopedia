{"id": 387757, "slug": "waiting-for-godot", "name": "Waiting for Godot", "name_original": "Waiting for Godot", "description": "<p>This adaption of the classic Samuel Beckett play fixes many of the original work's shortcomings. Like the lack of shooting, the lack of aliens, or Godot actually showing up (or does he?). Thankfully, using almost 2020 technology, we are able to improve and fix the original design. Lucky us!<br/></p>\n<p>So yeah, don't believe the flavor text, it's a horrible mess. The last demo days had entries from Russian /gd/ posters which became known colloquially as \"Godot hellscapes\", and I really wanted to try my spin on it. In addition to that, the last two Halloween Jams I used Unity and Unreal respectively, so I thought why not make Halloween about trying new technology and thought trying\u00a0my hand at Godot could be something. It's a fun engine, I am especially smitten with its tilemap tools. Still going to stick with prism though, unless Godot introduces the export to Dreamcast function (please don't).</p>\n<p><strong>INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: IMMEDIATELY AFTER EXTRACTING, SET THE ICON SIZE IN YOUR FOLDER TO LARGE OR ABOVE! OTHERWISE THE ICON FOR SOME REASON WANTS TO STAY THE DEFAULT GODOT LOGO! THIS DOES NOT CAUSE PROBLEMS WHAT SO EVER, BUT SLIGHT EMBARASSMENT FOR ME!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls for Windows:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Start Game - Enter</li><li>Shoot - A</li><li>Switch characters - S</li><li>Restart Level - R</li><li>Movement - Arrow keys</li><li>Jump - Up arrow key</li><li>Advance text - A</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional not</strong><strong>es:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Original release date: 10/30/2019</li><li>Source code is on\u00a0<strong>github</strong>:\u00a0http://github.com/CaptainDreamcast/WaitingForGodot/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:03:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85ef78b21e923a710f23a12b05ae7325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Captain Dreamcast"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
