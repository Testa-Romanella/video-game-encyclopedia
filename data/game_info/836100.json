After freaking out a little in the start trying to learn it from scratch, I decided to use my hand-drawn art style in the super low resolution, and it fits so well that I thought \"I can make the whole game this way!\" and I loved it!</p>\n<p>After this jam I think that the limitation may has been the best thing that happened to me in some time, because it made me have more confidence with my work, and encourage me to try new things, now I think I not only have a new art-style to work with (that is batter to work in some aspects) but I'm more secure to start new projects! I really LOVED THIS JAM!</p>\n<p><strong>Browser version notes:\u00a0</strong>Maybe the performance on the browser version is worse than the downloadable versions.\u00a0The Browser version is 192x192 (using pixel perfect camera to maintain the fidelity of the sprites), but if you want the true 64x64 pixels experience (or a bigger screen), download the game, it allows resizable window and it maintain the pixel fidelity :D<br/></p>\n<p><strong>-------------SOFTWARES USED-----------</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Engine: Unity\r\n</p>\n<p>Coding: Visual Studio (C#)\r\n</p>\n<p>Art: Procreate</p>\n<p>Music: Garage Band for Mac (using apple loops)\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: Audacity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T12:15:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/993/993b7d154d9b55f7831b57e019168c61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bruno Gat Car"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
