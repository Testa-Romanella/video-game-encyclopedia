{"id": 13233, "slug": "cubegun", "name": "CubeGun", "name_original": "CubeGun", "description": "<ol><li><strong>Design your own Battle Ship and Island</strong><br/>Design your own battle ship with weapons,armors,functional devices In a cube based editor. <br/></li><li><strong>Weapon Balance</strong> <br/>Every weapon has pros and cons,Every weapon is useful in the right position. <br/></li><li><strong>Multiple Battle Strategy</strong> <br/>To fight with different types of enemy ships,use different battle strategy. Use Energy Shield to block bullets, Use Mortar or Torpedo to break shield,AA-Gun to shoot torpedo,or use armor to protect your deck and charge enemy ship directly.Use thrust to rush to the weak side of enemy ship.Use cannon to push enemy back when they charge toward you. <br/></li><li><strong>No Role Level </strong><br/>Players are equal in online battle.There is no such thing as a level 99 player kills a level 1 player with a single bullet.It's all about your control of movement and right combination of weapons. <br/></li><li><strong>Design your own Profession</strong> <br/>Although there is no built-in profession as warrior or archer,With different combination of weapons and devices,you can customize the profession of your ship such as:Long range attack/Charge/Tank/Cure/Weapon obstruct. <br/></li><li><strong>Simple combat control</strong> <br/>Movement,Rotation and Critical Skill cast. <br/></li><li><strong>Weapon Merge &amp; Weapon Height </strong><br/>Put multiple weapons of the same kind in square pattern to merge them into a bigger one,make it more powerful.Raise the deck under a weapon to increase the shooting range. <br/></li><li><strong>Everything is physical and breakable</strong> <br/>Every part of ship can be destroyed.When you drive your ship to collide the other ship,Decks will be broken and ship will be push back  and rotate.Terrain can be destroyed with weapons too. <br/></li><li><strong>Support Multi-player battle up to 3V3</strong> <br/>Cooperate with your teammates in online battle,Cure your teammate's ship with huge combined Repair Station,Arm with plenty of armors to be the Tank of team and cover your long range attacker teammate,Collide enemy with your ship to stop them from escaping when your teammate is using super skill.</li></ol>Weapons&amp;Devices<ol><li><strong>Minigun</strong>:</li>[/b]High fire rate,high bullet speed,need turn your ship to aim. <li><strong>Energy Shield:</strong>Blocks high speed bullets,width 5,length 1,will turn red and lose function temporarily when get overtaken damage. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Torpedo:</strong>Fly pass through Energy shield,only weapon to destroy deck under device. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>AA-Gun:</strong>Shoot down all slow bullets as torpedo and mortar ammo,high fire rate,low range,low damage. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Armor:</strong>Protect the deck under it,can take several torpedo attacks,or use to collide with enemy's ship.Armor on a multiple level deck is very hard to destroy. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Mortar:</strong>Low fire rate,low bullet speed,long range.Fly pass through Energy shield and armor,destroy target directly,destroy multiple targets nearby with high damage,suitable to attack heavy armor enemy,not suitable to flexible ships. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Thrust:</strong>The bigger your ship is,the slower it will be,both in movement and steer,thrust increase ship's move and steer speed. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Cannon:</strong>Low fire rate,high bullet speed,push enemy ships back when hit,use it to push enemy back or push them to hill and crash into pieces. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Interference Robot:</strong>Hit target to make them lose function temporarily,can be used to interference weapons/energy shield/repair station/thrust etc. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Repair Station:</strong>Repair device nearby automatically,not include itself. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>LandMine:</strong>throw landmines and wait for enemy to trigger.Can be removed by AA-Gun<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Magnite:</strong>pull your target closely,very useful when you want to collide your enemy or pull your enemy to the landmine area.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Boomerang:</strong>can be used to attack enemy's back side,return immediately when hit enemy(so very effective in close combat),can't shoot again until the Boomerang fly back.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Deck Cube:</strong>All devices must be on a deck cube,A deck can have several levels,Higher deck gives the weapon on it longer attack range.If all levels of deck are destroyed,the device on it will be destroyed too,So use torpedo to attack the deck or collide it with your ship will destroy enemy's weapons and other devices indirectly. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Engine:</strong>Heart of the ship,more health point than other device,so is the deck under it.If it is destroyed,the ship will crash.</li></ol><br/><strong>Weapon

<strong>Armor</strong></li></ul><br/><strong>Strategy Balance</strong><br/><ul><li><strong>High fire rate weapons strategy defeats Flexible movement strategy: </strong><br/>High fire rate weapons can shoot flexible target accurately with high speed bullet. <br/></li><li><strong>Tank strategy defeats High fire rate weapons strategy: </strong> <br/>Energy shield and armor can block bullets effectively. <br/></li><li><strong>Low fire rate weapons strategy defeats Tank strategy:  </strong><br/>Take advantage of slow movement and heavy armor ships,use low speed but shield ignore missiles to destroy their line of defense. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Flexible movement strategy defeats Low fire rate weapons strategy:  </strong><br/>Use flexibility to dodge slow bullets and rush to the weak side of the enemy,shoot/collide and run.</li></ul><br/><strong>Points and Weight Balance</strong><br/>The design points of ships are limited.Every strategy of points allocation has pros and cons:<br/>Weapons and devices need more points.<br/>Deck Cube need less,the cheap deck can be used to collide enemy ship hull,Higher deck give the weapons longer shoot range and protect devices behind it.<br/>But more decks make your ship heavier,penalize you in low move and steer speed.Some weapons are more effective in numbers,such as single mortar has low accuracy,but plenty of mortars shoot at same time make enemy hard to escape.<br/>So it's better to allocate points in several kinds of weapons than buy all kinds all devices.Besides,combined weapon is mush more powerful than scattered ones. <br/><br/><strong>Critical Skill</strong><br/>The top most 3 kinds of devices can use Critical Skill in game  by clicking the Critical Skill button.More devices need more cool down time,which are more powerful as well.After you release the critical skill,the weapons will keep in critical model for a short time.Every device has special critical skill.Some weapon increase attack point,some weapon increase fire rate,the thrust increase force,Energy shield refill its energy and increase energy regenerate rate,Armor refill health point and increase defense rate.<br/>Use critical skill at right time is the key to win a battle,some critical skill can be used together,such as use critical thrust to rush to enemy then use critical armor to collide it.Use both critical thrust and critical cannon to fall back and push the following enemy away.Gameplay<ul><li>Single Game <br/>We made a serial of tutorial levels to teach players the pros and cons of every weapon,let you practice designing different kinds of ships to fight against enemies.Challenge epic Boss when you are ready.Some player may like to build their own levels with the built-in level and enemy editor.We plan to publish the whole editor to public in near future then you can upload your home made single play level to our game server and share with others. <br/></li><li>Loot Base <br/>Build your military island and loot random player's island with your battle ship.If you defeat them,loot their gold,or leave yours if you die.This game mode need a network to download random island data,but don't need continuous connection as PVP mode,so if you are playing this game mode with your mobile device outside your house where is no WIFI connection,mobile network will be enough. <br/></li><li>Online Battle <br/>This is the best part of the game,Fight other players with your teammate in real time,test your skills you practice in single game,and cooperate with your teammate.You can choose a buit-in map or a player made map. <br/>We plan to publish several game mode of online game map <br/><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Battle Map:players vs players death match. <br/></li><li>Cooperation Island Map:players vs computer controlled evil island <br/></li><li>Cooperation Ship Map:players vs computer controlled evil ships</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-21", "tba": false, "updated":
