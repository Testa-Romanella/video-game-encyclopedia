Thanks for checking this project out! You look amazing!\u00a0<br/><br/>This is our entry (myself and Sal86) in the Brackeys 2020.2 Game Jam! This is the first time either of us has entered a game jam and the week-long deadline, although a bit tight, was a great challenge!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The theme for this Jam was Rewind and so we put our heads together and came up with \"Time Flies (and sometimes it crawls) - A short game involving our main character's escape from Death's time hordes, using Rewind Pills to stay young.\u00a0<br/><br/>We tried our best to create all the artwork ourselves, but we have used some assets for backgrounds and music. All artists have been credited in-game, and thanks to everyone who made their assets available for us to use! Special thanks to seqtet for her help too!\u00a0<br/><br/>We hope you enjoy it, we had a blast making it, and any comments are always welcome! :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Windows and Mac versions available.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:39:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63deba36ed1a6b8aa24261552de2b3b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pixelated Sasquatch", "Sal86"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
