The bears, who are perfectly white, are invisible against the white snow, and you are slowly freezing to death when you stray away from the safety of the fire. The combination of these two mechanics creates an interesting tension when you are forced to throw yourself blindly into the snow, going slow enough to dodge any bears that present themselves but fast enough that you don\u2019t freeze.</p>\n\n<p>Andrew Dakhil: Art<br/>David Do: Design<br/>Marek Kapolka: Code<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T04:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/891881635612255d70d966c0bfc25f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sjsugamedev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
