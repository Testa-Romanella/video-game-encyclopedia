Your feedback is crucially important to the development of a more polished and finished demo of the game, so thank you for playing the game and let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Escape Path is a roleplaying strategy\u00a0game\u00a0where the choices you make throughout the game will result in one of numerous endings, but there is only one way out.\u00a0The gameplay is similar to a dungeon crawler, with turn based movement and procedurally generated rooms. But, there is a story element added to influence your decisions with\u00a0humor and personalities to the characters. Which path will you take?</p>\n<p>Note: This is only the beginning of your journey. No path escapes in this demo, but I did add endings just for the demo that represent the path you chose.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>W, A, S, D or Arrow Keys:</strong>\u00a0Move the character up and down or left and right.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Enter or Return Key</strong>: Submit or continue dialogue.
