Please let me know if you find any bugs and tell me what I can do better. I tried to get this game run in browser, but the fps were trash, so you have to download this game. Tipp: Search for the portal in the beginning and look around you.</p><p>Since the graphics are quite good, the game does not run well on low end PCs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T07:19:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69d/69d7012f706884aca11db886a522e305.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DeepWaterGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
