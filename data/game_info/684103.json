At least there's only one day left right? When you wake up from the birds and get back on the roads, I'm sure everything will be fine. Though, you are in that area which everyone kept spreading rumors about. Near the canyon where it's fabled the blood of men\u00a0spills freely, and the water is toxic\u00a0and there is some sort demonic cloaked figure which claims lives in horrific ways. Just some superstition though.</p>\n\n<p>It was major crunch to make this game. kealmcking\u00a0and Finzlow proudly present Bone Chasm. This horrific survival game was primarily designed with atmosphere in mind. It features PS1 style graphics and sound effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T07:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd3/cd3fb15e40da068d3779d1a2da2623c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kealmcking", "Finzlow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
