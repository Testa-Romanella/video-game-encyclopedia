You play as a beetle (trust me, its a beetle) that runs automatically and you have to move and jump to avoid hitting walls and falling. There are <strong>6 levels</strong> and a\u00a0<strong>bonus challenge mode</strong> if you beat the game.</p>\n<p>Made as a part of my tradition of making a game every December. Had to rush some things\u00a0in order to reach my deadline, so expect to complete the game in around 20 minutes. Still, hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>Check out my other projects on my page: https://alesan99.itch.io/.</p>\n<p><strong>Default Controls:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0(You can change them in the settings)</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0WASD<ul><li>Holding up makes you run faster and run\u00a0over short gaps</li><li>Holding down makes you run slower (never required)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Jump:</strong> Space</li><li><strong>Pause:</strong> Escape</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Music by\u00a0Komiku</li><li>Made with L\u00d6VE</li><li>Groverburger's 3D Engine (old version and modified, take a look at my source code if you're interested in some of the effects used in the game)</li><li>Cirno's Perfect Math Library</li><li>Anim9</li><li>Inter-Quake Model Loader</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T06:35:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16d/16d18634292b665f608978f681f44363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["alesan99"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
