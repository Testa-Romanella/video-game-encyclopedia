(My first time working in unity was 2 weeks ago, using the standard Unity FPS Tutorial module). This was a learning process involving textures, cameras, scripting, modeling, inputs, play controlling, player movement, and more. Overall I call it an \"exploration of play and design concepts brought about while learning the workings of unity\" since I hesitate to call it a prototype. <br/><br/>Note that you will probably have to double click on the screen to prevent your mouse from escaping, as well as maybe changing your mouse DPI.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is highly recommended that you look at my portfolios description and explanation of this prototype for a complete understanding of it. <br/></p>\n<p>https://calvinhilgert.wixsite.com/portfolio/2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T07:20:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecdc8c0178e67f154c63081f1c5be040.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["calvin_hilgert"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
