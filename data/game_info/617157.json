Your job is to make sure all exhibits are in good condition. And so one day a bunch of hooligans comes in and smashes all the exhibits. Now you have to fix this mess. Use special glue to glue them back together.</p>\n<p>Use left mouse button to use tools. Right mouse button to move your camera. Mouse wheel to zoom(Sensitivity on WebGL is broken, sorry)<br/></p>\n<p>Use toolbar to select tools: select allows dragging parts around. Glue tool allows to apply glue onto surfaces. And join button magically joins correct parts together(Don't ask why.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately i had to restart on day two, so this was made in about 15 hours. This is a demo, not a complete game, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>I advise you to use Windows build.</p><p>POST JAM update: Although according to rules i can't upload bug fix build, i have uploaded this, because build on itch has a few breaking bugs. It does not have any big changes, just bug fixes. Just remember that this build is not part of GMTK jam voting.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:24:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb7/bb7ad345e78135adf4345af4b85caf91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ilya"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
