Move between five food lanes to eat the food that is the same as you. If you eat the wrong food, you lose milk. If you run out of milk, you must start over.\u00a0 Every piece of food that makes it to the incinerator gives you points. Eating food also increases multiplier which increases speed and point collection.<br/></p>\n<p>My 2nd game Jam. I honestly shouldn't count anymore. But I have a small youtube channel and look up to dani.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T04:28:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a5/5a542503489225cb06179f94b0d0b721.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pickzel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
