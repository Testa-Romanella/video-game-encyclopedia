That's my take on Magic Head.</strong></p><p>Left Click = Red Face</p><p>Right click = Blue Face<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a83/a83b20191e241737cedef781dd176087.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunrisekingdom"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
