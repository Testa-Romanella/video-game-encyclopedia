This is done by assembling the cards in a sequence of King to Ace, which will then remove that tableau from the table. <br/><br/>Game Rules:<br/><br/>To start, there are 2 decks of cards used.  (If playing on Easy or Medium, the number of cards are the same, but they all share suits).  54 cards are dealt to 10 piles on the table, they are all face down except for the top cards.  The tableau stacks decrease by rank, and when they share the same suit, they can be moved together at the same time.  The other 50 cards are in the draw pile, and can be dealt 10 cards (one per pile) at any time.  The cards are dealt face up and will go in sequence on top of the piles.  Cards can not be drawn if there is an empty column, every column must have at least one card in there to be able to draw from the deck. Any card value can be placed on an empty column.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T07:48:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1ebd90019a73910d5b2cdc214e61b82f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Six Foot Three Foot"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Six Foot Three Foot"], "esrb_rating": null}
