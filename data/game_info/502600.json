As you approached the creature it turned around and attacked you instantly. You were forced to shoot it.</p>\n<p>Suddenly you were surrounded and attacked by a horde of these strange creatures. You opened fire, but they were too many. Unfortunately, most of the SWAT members did not stand a chance and were brutally killed.\r\n  </p>\n<p>However, you managed to free one of your colleagues from the onslaught, though he was badly injured. You instantly pulled him backwards, along a dark alleyway. A dead-end, it seemed. Your buddy pointed at an open sewer-lid. You managed to get him down the hatch and just barely, got the lid closed before the horde of creatures were on top of you both.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Your colleague's wounds need to be dealt with in a hurry.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Like any other shooter, you need to find guns and ammo to kill the enemy in order to survive.</p>\n<p>As you progress, you will come across objects of interest. Some objects are collectable and some are usable. Your crosshair cursor will indicate the color green when an item or object is allowed to be picked up or used.</p>\n<p>The flashlight has an unlimited battery.</p>\r\nThe inventory\r\n<p>The items you collect appear in your inventory. Items will automatically be removed from inventory if used correctly.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Movement: WASD</p>\n<p>Sprint: Shift</p>\n<p>Fire: Left Mouse</p>\n<p>Reload: R</p>\n<p>Jump: Space</p>\n<p>Interact: E</p>\n<p>Inventory: I or TAB</p>\n<p>Light: F</p>\n<p>Quick heal: H</p>\n<p>Menu / Close: Escape</p>\r\nGame in development\r\n<p>Even though this is an early access version, the game is still completable. However, you may come across some unfinished elements, such as unnecessary items or incomplete objectives.</p>\n<p>The game style is a bit like Left4Dead and Resident Evil.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The full game will contain more areas, substation, city streets, etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the time being, the game is only available for Windows.<br/></p>\n<p>I am hoping to receive some feedback, constructive criticism from you guys. I am open for good suggestions as well.<br/></p>\r\nContact Information:\r\n<p>acesgamedevelopment@gmail.com</p>\n<p>https://www.bricksite.com/aces/</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/YEeKJ7H</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/acesgamesdk/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:37:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ba/3ba6cb46d21feee0c44d2e257955091a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aces Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
