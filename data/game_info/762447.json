The \"bounce on contact\" and \"feed to be come friends\", which are in the game. Also a pet / shout, which would affect their movement, and a ride ability. These two was harder to implement in a interesting way, and would need to be made specifically for each animal, because of how little they overlap between each other. Maybe I will try that in a different game.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Sound effects\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sapht CCBY Damage https://freesound.org/people/sapht/sounds/37986/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Sonic ring sound https://freesound.org/people/bradwesson/sounds/135936/\r\n</li><li>Spark boots https://freesound.org/people/Wakerone/sounds/393067/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Item pickup sound https://freesound.org/people/magnuswaker/sounds/567310/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Silent hill ish denial https://freesound.org/people/GameAudio/sounds/220167/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Vinyl scratch - https://freesound.org/people/ZeSoundResearchInc./sounds/117511/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Falling into the sewers https://freesound.org/people/blukotek/sounds/268914/\r\n</li><li>Hitting the bottom https://freesound.org/people/Kievinay/sounds/512389/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Monkey throwing, https://freesound.org/people/AntumDeluge/sounds/417817/ , https://freesound.org/people/AntumDeluge/sounds/417816/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Animals getting\u00a0 hit, jew harp https://freesound.org/people/tosha73/sounds/496938/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Animals getting happy, Anime wow sound https://freesound.org/people/ATG65/sounds/621470/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Crocodile jumping - https://freesound.org/people/aarontheonly/sounds/614007/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Crocodile Anticipate https://freesound.org/people/AntumDeluge/sounds/417821/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Activating battery, Power down robot https://freesound.org/people/noirenex/sounds/159399/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Wrap around - Teleport https://freesound.org/people/outroelison/sounds/150950/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Collectable https://freesound.org/people/Wagna/sounds/325805/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Hitting buttons to open doors https://freesound.org/people/Skullsmasha/sounds/123253/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>End https://freesound.org/people/Anuj_Shrestha1/sounds/555637/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Cash https://freesound.org/people/Zott820/sounds/209578/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Map icons https://openmoji.org/library/\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Drum loops\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Starting area - https://freesound.org/people/gipsyGA/sounds/262490/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Upgrade - https://freesound.org/people/Stereo%20Surgeon/sounds/261335/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Sewers - https://freesound.org/people/.Andre_Onate/sounds/162064/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Main Streets - https://freesound.org/people/FOSSA11/sounds/198773/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Storage - https://freesound.org/people/drandarko/sounds/180053/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Giraffes - https://freesound.org/people/brudelarge/sounds/111072/\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Crocodiles - https://freesound.org/people/justinrobert/sounds/159515/</li><li>Monkeys - https://freesound.org/people/Bronxio/sounds/242968/ </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T15:39:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c73d64569979e06e70bdeaa35dcc205f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["E.T.C.Lundberg"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
