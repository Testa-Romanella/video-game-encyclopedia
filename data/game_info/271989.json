The scene is quite simple, and my own translation is pretty poor... Please forgive me....<br/>But at least the game's diffculty is similar to the Dark Souls.(*maybe?)<br/>(TIPS: always press the block button)<br/>Mysterious Heroine played the Dark Souls,<br/>She made a dream after that....<br/>Fate + Dark Souls = ?<br/>Thanks for playing this game!
