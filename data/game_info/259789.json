He would probably have found a job and settled down to a life of dull, well-fed monotony, if it hadn&#39;t been for the mystic circumstances that revealed to him\u2014and not by chance\u2014the truth about the town, about science, and about magic.<br />\nVed is a role playing game combined with a vivid platform game, where each decision means as &#39;little&#39; as it does in real life. Talking to different characters can earn you their respect and friendship, or can even instil fear\u2014which may be the key to success. Here everyone acts according to their own motives: don&#39;t be too quick to condemn your enemies or to trust your friends. Not before you realize just how multi-layered the conflict in this world is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2022-07-29T06:42:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e1706c3bf1239eb6c92ec10aab125cab.jpg", "website": "https://collective.square-enix.com/projects/376/ved/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "Xbox One", "iOS", "PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Karaclan"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Fulqrum Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
