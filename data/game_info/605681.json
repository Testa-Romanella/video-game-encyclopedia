Battle cosmic space-invading spiders across curved landscapes where bullets hug the terrain while the horizon drops sharply out of sight.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInspired by arcade classics, players will have to hunt for weapon power-ups and upgrades while dodging enemy fire, blasting interdimensional bugs, and wrangling some enormous boss monsters. Simple to learn as you fight your way through the branching story-driven campaign, but tough to master as you chase the glory of the leaderboards.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>Old School Shmup Reimagined: Enjoy the high-energy action of traditional 2D shoot \u2018em ups in a warped 3D space.

Your choices will lead you to take on one of three potential versions of the game\u2019s protagonist to fight back the invasion on asteroids, space stations, and other intergalactic stages. Each unique version takes the story in a different direction.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</li><li>Arena: Take on over 60 randomized challenges from the game\u2019s campaign for a chance to get your name on the local leaderboard.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</li><li>Survival: Fight through waves of invaders with each wave presenting a new, more difficult challenge. \u00a0\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</li><li>Endless: Tackle waves of randomized challenges from the campaign as well as additional objectives as you adapt to what the game decides to throw your way.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</li><li>Daily Run: You get one shot each day to complete this daily run and achieve the highest score possible.
