Thank you William and Ethan for dealing with my lack of comprehension with my life!\u00a0</p>\n<p>We used Unity and Photoshop to make this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE:</p>\n<p>Also there is a glitch if you press the space bar when you're not supposed to. Don't hit the space bar after the mean girls say \"ok ok stop fighting\", the scene will play automatically.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thank you Mallory, Elizabeth, Marcelo, Ben, Jonathan, and Matthew for being such supportive people and for helping us! We learned a lot from you! And much love to my cluster too, for being my favorite people ever. I miss you all so much.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Also shoutout to Marco for being the best partner I've ever had on a group project ever!!!! Quality code and file organization creds to him!
