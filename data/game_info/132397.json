Transform into different objects to solve puzzles and gain access to other rooms in the mansion and ultimately find your way to freedom. <br/><br/>CONTROLS: <br/><br/>- Controls change depending on what you are shapeshifted as, but WASD is always for movement and left and right click will interact with the environment. <br/><br/>- Unfortunately, there is only a very limited number of things you can shape shift into. If we had more time we'd have loved to let you turn into everything. <br/><br/>- Tab zooms in and out (this is important, some puzzles require it)<br/><br/>- Space moves through dialogue. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>HINT: You do NOT need to be near something you want to shape shift into. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d1dbd4f09cf20da51c41c765a07a73b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HeartLamp"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
