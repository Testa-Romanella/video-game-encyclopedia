Up and coming freight pilots such as yourself can choose from many different jobs including both lucrative and risky missions. Each island comes with its own airstrip for players to start from and land on. They also act as a hub for getting new transport jobs. Stopovers are possible at three basic airfields, where you can also park your planes in your three personal hangars and refuel them. To complete missions as good as possible you can chose from three different planes with different characteristics you can boost using upgrades for speed, sturdiness or fuel capacity. And thanks to the game's open-ended gameplay, the fun just never stops!Features:<ul><li>Over a hundred different transport missions, some of them very lucrative, but also quite risky.\t<br/></li><li>Exotic setting on an archipelago with twelve islands.\t<br/></li><li>Three different planes, which can be improved using upgrades for speed, sturdiness and fuel capacity\t<br/></li><li>Personal hangars and three basic airfields.\t<br/></li><li>Mouse and keyboard controls</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38b15ba399cbb8bad8ad8a646c51c904.jpg", "website": "http://www.libredia.com/component/k2/item/163-island-flight-simulator", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 39, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 490, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Joindots", "Libredia", "Silent Future", "Caipirinha Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Libredia", "Joindots"], "esrb_rating": null}
