At the start of each level, you receive a list of orders that you must fulfill within a certain time limit. The orders can range from simple dishes like sandwiches and salads to more complex items like pasta dishes and grilled meats.\r\n</p>\n<p>To fulfill each order, you must use the kitchen equipment and ingredients available to you. For example, you might need to chop vegetables, cook meat on a grill, or assemble sandwiches. Once the dish is prepared, you must serve it to the correct customer by clicking on their table.\r\n</p>\n<p>The key to success in the game is to work quickly and efficiently. You must keep an eye on the time and prioritize orders based on their complexity and the amount of time remaining. You must also ensure that each customer receives their correct order, as they will become unhappy and leave if they receive the wrong dish or have to wait too long.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you progress through the levels, the game becomes more challenging, with more customers to serve and more complex dishes to prepare. You may also need to deal with unexpected events, such as equipment breakdowns or rush hour crowds.<br/><br/>\n</p><p>Links:</p><p>Github:\u00a0https://github.com/xusk947/cookix</p><p>Discord: https://discord.gg/dExvfufv2s<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T14:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d94/d94d51fff65de49bae0f30eb76671d97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xusk947"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
