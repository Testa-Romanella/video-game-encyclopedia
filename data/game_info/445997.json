Unknown dangers and treasures await your townsfolk, so the town requires adventurers to protect it and explore the surrounding areas. However, the chaos that the adventuring lifestyle brings can often times cause more problems than it solves.

Will you stand the test of time, or will your works return to dust as many have before?<br/></p>\n<p>A turn-based roguelite*\u00a0city builder, where each day you have a limited pool of wealth to build and upgrade your city.
