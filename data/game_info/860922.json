Thoughts are different every time and move further as each vanishes.</li><li><strong>PLEASANT POOL:</strong>\u00a0 Embrace true stillness to achieve Zen. Can you be THAT calm? Maybe you should. Mouse and keyboard inputs are detected.</li><li><strong>BLOSSOM DROP:</strong>\u00a0 Guide a falling cherry blossom petal through the wind to land on a lonely floating lilypad with the left and right buttons. Watch for the direction of the wind.</li><li><strong>DEEP BREATH:\u00a0</strong>Practice mindful breathing (and feel free to breathe along.) Hold left to breath in, down to hold and right to breathe out, in that order. Watch the spinning mandalas for hints.</li><li><strong>SOUND BODY:</strong> Achieve balance by focusing against the wind. Use the left and right buttons to center yourself, using the meter and the leaves in the wind\u00a0as guides. Don't be sad if you make a splash though.</li><li><strong>QUIET REPOSE: (<em>Requires Microphone</em>)</strong> Can you embrace true silence? This game monitors your environment for sound input. Be as silent as you can until the mandalas vanish. Or simply try again. <em>(Note: this game is not required to be played to unlock other in-game features).</em></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Desktop: </em></strong>Zen Games supports WASD controls for directional inputs as well as arrow keys.\u00a0 The mouse may be used to click buttons on Stage Select and the Esc/X button.
