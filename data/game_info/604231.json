This is a game in the vein of the idle clicker styled games, so sit back and relax while growing your swarm of bees.</p>\n<p>If there are 0 bees in your swarm, the game is over. So remember to keep adding more bees. Bees only live a set amount of time before they expire and move on to the great bee hive in the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 4 types of bees:</p>\n<ol><li>The scout bee will automatically look for new plants to harvest honey from and return back to the hive to report the new location</li><li>The worker bee will harvest and deposit the honey from the plants automatically. If there are no new plants the worker bee will return to the hive and wait</li><li>The fighter bee will attack any poisonous plants that are found by any bee.\u00a0</li><li>The pollinator bee will pollinate a plant that has been depleted, replenishing the harvest potential.</li></ol>\n<p>Some plants are poisonous, and will slow down any bee that comes into contact with it. You are advised to send a fighter bee to deal with these pesky unwanted plants.</p>\n<p>A bee must first scout new types of flower before the flowers are able to be planted for a cost.</p>\n<p>Use W/A/S/D or mouse to move camera around on the map, and use the scroll wheel to zoom. Click on the hive or on the build buttons in the top left corner for access to upgrades and plants.</p>\n\n<p>Created for Mini Jam #80:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-80-cats</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T04:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/347be8a793c46f172e5020f78f97987a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["doubleday", "TimsyMagnus"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
