The game has a large focus on exploration and uncovering clues to unlock new routes, with the seventh secret ending even requiring clues from five endings before it. It also features digital artwork made by me for all the major characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T09:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c41/c416fa5302ee18192cd1d8bea84351fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EpisodicChaos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
