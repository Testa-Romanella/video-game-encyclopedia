It's not very funny though.</p>\n<p>It is set in a not terribly far future in which humans try to settle on the remote worlds of the Xenov star system. They are already inhabitated but that doesn't stop humanity. The story centers around two incredibly qualified secret agents on a top secret mission and a pizza delivery boy who gets caught into their schemes by accident. I worked alone on it and barely the intro of the story made it into the game in the given time frame. I still think the general idea comes across.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T06:11:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a5/4a547228f73e3f0352a7adb204ed9325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Popcornmotte"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
