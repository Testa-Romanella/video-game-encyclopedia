The theme this week was camerawork so I made a game where you play as a prison officer that monitors the security cameras. Keep an eye on all 3 prisoners to make sure they don't escape, but remember, you have paperwork to get done! Make sure you're getting you're work done and making sure the prisoners stay put in this stressful fast-paced game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ff/7ff0965235cb4afb289547aed4707cc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Seiruzan"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
