The being has no memory  of their former life, but the areas they must explore offer hints as to  who they once were.  </p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>This game uses simple directional controls. You can choose between W,  A, S, and D, or the arrow keys. The up key is jump, the down key is  crouch, and the left and right keys are to move left and right, or if  crouched, to crouch-walk in the corresponding direction. To enter a  door, walk in front of it and press the down key. There is also a  pouncing mechanic; press the up key and a direction at the same time to  pounce in that direction at full horizontal speed. <br/></p><p>The escape button pauses the game. While paused, you can restart a level, go back to the menu, and toggle on/off the CRT effect.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T20:01:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f839d37b460efb0d35aa3c7adedc1afb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rcamwm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
