Press A on your keyboard to drop a red ball, and hear his cries for help.</p>\n<p>This innovative experience has been in the works for months, it's been a real passion project of mine. It's an artistic experience about the pain we've all been feeling in quarantine, and the symbolic nature of our hero being in a Box, crying out for help as his only action is to produce waste in the form of Red icospheres, I think truly resonates with people in our modern times.</p>\n<p>This game is DRM free and available under the GNU GPL.
