It was a week long Jam with the given theme of Upgrade. So I took the twist of a person playing a clicker game and upgrading the clicker game and you being the player are inside of the game running the machines that give the player money. So you have to try your best to keep up with the demand of the person's endless upgrading. Don't get the player too frustrated by you not keeping up with his demands or it's game over!</p>\n<p>This is my first ever completed project so I am quite happy with the outcome and I learned a lot from this experience and I can't wait to do it again sometime!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T08:06:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c56/c56fb5869561c4de79e67aafadf7f6e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diggyholedwarf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
