This engine allows you to build character-based games\u00a0for C64, C16, Plus/4, VIC20 and PET machines from a single code base just by changing one flag. Video, sound, random number generation etc. is all handled by the library, so the game code\u00a0just needs to call a routine or macro and (mostly)\u00a0doesn't need to know which system it's running on.</p>\n<p>The Plus/4 version is not far away, just sound support to add. The PET version will be a little while longer because I have to draw to screen in a completely different way.</p>\n<p>Code will shortly be\u00a0available on Github.
