Playable <strong>from 2 to 4 players</strong> with controllers / keyboard.</p>\n<p>Note that the game still runs when there is only <strong>one player</strong> so that you can try it.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\nCollect coins until the time is up ...\r\n<p>Four teenager Prabbits - half parrot, half rabbit creatures - are undertaking their Coming-of-Age ritual. </p>\n<p>They are spawned in an arena with <strong>a crown and a timer</strong>. Once the crown is picked up by a Prabbit, <strong>coins, diamonds and rubies</strong> appear across the level. Only the Prabbit with the crown can collect them.</p>\n<p>A <strong>competition starts between Prabbits</strong> to catch the crown and collect gold. When the timer ends, the richer Prabbit wins.</p>\r\nWhile putting the others temporarily out\r\n<p>The Prabbits have several ways to hurt each other. They can <strong>throw spires</strong>, <strong>slap each other</strong>, pick up another Prabbit and <strong>make a lethal throw</strong>. </p>\n<p>To slap someone <strong>increases their fatigue</strong> (fatigue marks on his head), which <strong>will increase the respawning time</strong> the next time they die. Time is precious - the longer a player is waiting to respawn, the less they can collect gold or change the outcome of the game.</p>\r\nCustomization\r\n<p>Note that you have access to the assets of the game so that you can <strong>replace the sounds, graphics</strong>, or even <strong>make your own levels</strong>. </p>\n<p>You can also simply configure the preference file to <strong>rename your characters</strong>, <strong>change the controls</strong> and <strong>change the resolution</strong>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore information at:</p>\n<p>https://nodragem.github.io/Blog/project/catchthecrown/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94c/94c492600301691aeba4505c2e535fdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nodragem"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
