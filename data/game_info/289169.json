You have to defend the island from the invaders, while waiting for the factory to produce ore containers, which then can be transported. If you manage to send 3 containers before the island is captured by the enemy, you win.</p>\n<p>I made this game more like as a prototype than an actual game. It has a few bugs and doesn't look so good,\u00a0because this is my first time making a 3D game with Godot. It also largely lacks sound and has no music.</p>\n<p>Tools used:</p>\n<ul><li>Game Engine - Godot 3.1 beta</li><li>Models - Blender</li><li>Sound - Audacity</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:41:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3ca7ca47ae4929fbcb5a61bf11815662.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fenderbate"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
