If this is not the target number (the number at the bottom) then a new number will appear that can be used.</p>\n<p>Press AC to clear any sums you have done, in case you have made a mistake. This will not reset the target number.<br/></p>\n<p>The time updates in realtime, but if you want more time to work on the current time just press the lock button. When you unlock the timer it will immediately update the game to match the current time.</p>\n<p>Font: Louis George Caf\u00e9 by Chen Yining https://www.dafont.com/louis-george-caf.font</p>\n<p>Padlock: www.pngitem.com/middle/hoowJxw_lock-icon-png-transparent-png/<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5a/c5ae936f95ad82940861da30196058fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Philip Newsham"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
