The Racers draft track segment cards. Pick the right cards for your kart, or pick cards you <em>don't</em> want the others to have.</p>\n<p>Once the draft is done, everyone, in order, plays cards from their hand to build the track\u2014a track build by the committee, what could go wrong.</p>\n<p>After that, it's off to the races. Your kart is put on the track to see how it fairs. Watch and Enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>This is a game built entirely for the web using the React and Redux libraries (against my better judgment : )\u00a0).
