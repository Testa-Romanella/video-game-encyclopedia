The test subjects were mainly people with criminal records and the tests themselves were performed illegally without the subjects' consent. Things were going well, many of the experiments resulted in death and the growing number of corpses turned the fields around the base into a graveyard. One day something strange happened. During a radioactive experiment all of the test subjects became\u00a0aggravated and resentful but in the meantime they were begging the scientists to continue injecting them with the poisonous chemical. Soon after that they were locked up in their chamber but they didn't stay there for a long time. During the upcoming night they managed to break free and take more of the radioactive substance. The subjects became even more insane. They managed to kill all of the guards and now the entire base is littered with their demented presence.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Controls</strong></li></ul>\n<p>MOVEMENT - WASD</p>\n<p>RUN - Left Shift</p>\n<p>JUMP - Space</p>\n<p>SHOOT - Mouse Left Click</p>\n<p>SCOPE WITH AR - Mouse Right Click</p>\n<p>CHANGE WEAPONS - Num Keys 1, 2, 3 or Mouse Scroll Wheel</p>\n<p>INTERACT - E</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T07:53:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/dea2ab96149a944462cd99d439c39cfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beefy Donkey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
