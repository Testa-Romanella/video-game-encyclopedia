He arrives at school the next morning and learns someone tried to commit suicide in school the night before. Despite this, class goes on! Youngho drifts asleep during the final only to wake and find himself trapped in the school at night. The only problem is... he\u2019s not alone. You can run. You can hide. Can you survive while piecing together the nightmarish mystery of Sehwa High?\n\n<br/>\n\nThe Coma 2: Vicious Sisters\nMina Park, a student of Sehwa High and Youngho's childhood friend, awakens at night in Sehwa High. It isn\u2019t long before she realizes that something is amiss. The once-familiar school where she spends her evenings studying looks twisted by something dark and sinister. She finds herself pursued by someone, or something, that looks eerily like her English teacher. To survive, Mina must venture beyond the boundaries of her school and into the surrounding district. There, she will encounter strange creatures, mysterious strangers, and uneasy allies.\n\n<br/>\n\nAdditional The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters DLCs\n<ul><li>The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters - Soundtrack\n</li><li>The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters - Artbook\n</li><li>The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters - DLC - Locks of Love\n</li><li>The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters - DLC - Winter Princess\n</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<p>Languages, features and system requirements may vary between games - please check individual product pages for details.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T02:04:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50f/50f483c6beac235c146586246af98663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Devespresso Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Headup Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
