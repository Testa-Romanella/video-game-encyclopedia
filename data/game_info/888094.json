The ultimate goal is to collect enough evidence to make a report to the Principal on whether or not the school is actually haunted. Depending on the type of evidence found and what is done with it, the player can trigger one of 8 unique endings contingent on what answer is given and their interactions with two of the main NPCs.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T08:43:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/589588d2ac159b394ac1bb915e164c3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["HEMINGRU"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
