A therapist by day and a dom by night, Valdemar Andressen is a true eccentric, whose sustained sanity can be attributed to his comfortable city lifestyle and constant drunkenness on the feelings of humans around him.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>A story of friendship, tragedy, and unconditional love that explores the conflict between moral personhood and the human necessity of wearing different masks, Parfum Nostalgique is a coming of age for those who have already come of age, or what some would call a \u201cmidlife crisis,\u201d told from the point of view of an immortal man who hasn\u2019t stopped living like a single man in his 30s for over 2 centuries.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Coming Winter-Spring 2023.</p>\n\n<p>___</p>\n<p>THIS IS A DEMO.<br/></p>\n<p>Though this is but one tiny petal of the gorgeous josei drama-filled rose that will be the final Parfum Nostalgique story, it is dense with all of my\u00a0original art, music, and dialogue.
