This time, Spy Corps' corrupt counterpart, the Society for Meaningless Evil, Larceny, Lying and Yelling (S.M.E.L.L.Y.) has devised a dogbot which will be unleashed upon the unsuspecting world! In his nastiness, S.M.E.L.L.Y.'s corrupt commander, Napoleon LeRoach, did not install an OFF switch on the dogbot. Instead, he hid the switch somewhere within the World's Fair. <br/><br/>The Mission: Find the hidden OFF switch, deactivate the dogbot and stop LeRoach in his robotic tracks! <br/><br/>\u2014User Reviews\u2014 <br/>\u201cIn a word, this game is scrumptious and it all fits together seamlessly with some crazy cut-scenes and lots of features\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cBy remembering it is a game and trying to be fun instead of sinister like all the junky games I play, Spy Fox 2: Some Assembly Required is more fun than the newest PC graphics card, an episode of Get Smart and the latest Bond movie, combined.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cKid testers were thoroughly absorbed in the adventure, and were determined to solve the mystery and win the game. Even parents enjoyed the humor.\u201d<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>\u2022 Experience Junior Adventures delight in the challenging puzzles and cool mini-games. <br/>\u2022 The secret ending is almost as elusive as SPY Fox's modesty. Can you find it? <br/>\u2022 Simple touchscreen navigation makes it easy to guide Spy Fox.<br/>\u2022 Think you solved the mystery for good? Play again - you may find a whole new adventure awaiting you!<br/><br/>This product uses ScummVM which is released under the GNU GPL v2. <br/>For more information, please visit - https://www.scummvm.org <br/>The GNU GPL can be viewed here - https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T05:43:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edc/edc1252a72d868e8888705cd535d2963_sdvakni.jpg", "website": "http://www.humongous.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Humongous Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Tommo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
