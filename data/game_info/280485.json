A lot of deaths, proven or otherwise have been linked to it whether it was through confirmed police operations, vigilante killings or what the media likes to call it \"extra judicial killings\".<br/><br/><strong>Tulak is a 2D choice based, puzzle adventure game</strong> set in a fictional \"barangay\" in the City of Manila. The dialogue of the game is in Filipino with street slang with mature themes and heavy language, with<strong> multiple endings</strong>.<br/><br/>Tulak was conceptualized during the heat of the issue, we noticed that the mainstream media only likes to sensationalize and reports the deaths, not telling the stories behind them. We didn't chose to make this interactive story to spread a propaganda or choose sides rather show a fictional yet inspired by true events, story about those caught in between. Those who grew up into the lower bowels of the Manila drug underbelly.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>I, myself specifically grew up in areas no different from the setting of the game, and as the artist I wanted to really nail down the feel, the atmosphere and the interactions/dialogue within the characters.\u00a0 Hence the project felt close to home.<br/><br/>This is the initial part of the game, it can be played from \"start to finish\" as it is, however <strong>if me and my team were given a budget or a chance to continue the project I already have a script in mind and this initial game would technically serve as \"Episode 1\" in the same vein as Telltale games and Life is Strange games where we would go the episodic route.</strong><br/><br/>The game has been showcased on <strong><em>ESGS 2018\u00a0</em></strong>and has been nominated and won awards during the <strong><em>ICT Creative Awards Night,\u00a0</em></strong>winning <strong>Best in Game Art, Best in Narrative, and Best Game for Many</strong>. And being nominated for <strong>Game of The Year</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We hope you like what we were able to put out, and support us by donating any amount if you happen to appreciate the effort we've put out, or help us get the word out for the game and help us get an investor or a publisher.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>In behalf of my team,<br/>Thank You.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f7/7f7673addc9af4196cab07f70b992e76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stevencible"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
