It features 3D puzzles, full undo/redo, and smart placement of pieces. The non-linear level graph means you don&#39;t have to beat one level before unlocking the next one. The game also comes with a built-in level editor, so you can build and share your own corners of the city.Cube Trains is open-source software, but the expansion pack, with additional levels and pieces, is available for $2.00 to help fund future development.
