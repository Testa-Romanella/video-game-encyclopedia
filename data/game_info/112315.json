{"id": 112315, "slug": "swarmer", "name": "Swarmer", "name_original": "Swarmer", "description": "<p>It's a massive real-time strategy, in which you have to control three types of units to destroy your enemy and build swarmers on the ashes of his buildings. Your units are produced automatically. You just have to lead them in battle and enlarge your swarm.</p>\n<p>Enemies are unknown when you look at them. You have to use special spotlights around the map to light your way \u2014 and to prepare for encounter.</p>\n<p>The game's visuals are a sophisticated example of placeholder art, with animated cubes and spheres, and basically no textures, because we couldn't get any artists.</p>\n<p>To win, you have to destroy a great red tower on the north of the map \u2014 inside a well guarded enemy base. To do this, you should dominate some smaller posts (and build some swarmers in there).</p>\n<p><strong>You can only build on marked slots</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Every unit has a counter-unit</strong>. Discover which is which.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>Controls\r\n<ul><li>Left mouse button \u2013 selecting units, building on blue spots</li><li>Right mouse button \u2013 moving units</li><li>1, 2, 3 \u2013 selecting all units of given type.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Kamil Koz\u0142owski</li><li>Jakub Rogalski</li><li>Used score: \"Passionate ending\" by Soft and Furious (public domain)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52c/52c073cc78234d0117be66ac7016810c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pankamil"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
