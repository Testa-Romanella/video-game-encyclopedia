Board the Borealis and take down the combine through space and time, and use your past to stop the future.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you are expecting anything other than time travel and combat, you will be sorely disappointed. That is the ONLY thing in this game. It's 5min of combat against YOUR ENEMIES AND THEIR GHOSTS</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0Everything is stolen. Like, I don't think there's one original piece of art here. Zero monetizable opportunity - but shoutout to all the artists on Garry's mod makin cool Borealis models and Valve for doing an excellent job with all the HL2 assets. Made as a tribute, intended to be transformative and not for commercial use. Special thanks also though to Laura Michet for running the jam and Heather Flowers/Rachel Sala/Brendon Chung for inspiring/awesome entries!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Blatant plug: But what if everything wasn't stolen??? I made this cause I'm also making a game where your terrible boss keeps forgetting things and sending you back in time, but if you get seen (!!!) it's a universe collapsing time paradox! So it's a stealth game. Against you. From the past. You can check it out (it's called Scope Creep) riiiiight over here:\u00a0http://twitter.com/scopecreepgame<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b6/9b6f78085a5711c7882c493150a89dd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BlinksTale"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
