Although the recruitment process took only two weeks, we were forming as a team throughout the whole project.<br/><br/>We managed to achieve incredible results, which you can appreciate:<br/>    - Assembled a strong and talented team.<br/>    - Created a Game Design Document (GDD) that describes all aspects of the full game.<br/>    - Developed a flexible modular architecture for the game that makes it easy to scale the project.<br/>    - Produced numerous beautiful artistic concepts.<br/>    - Modeled and animated excellent 3D models.<br/>    - Composed a musical soundtrack.<br/><strong>And the best part is, there's a game you can play!</strong><br/><br/>The project started on December 15, 2022, and within 4 months, our creation came to life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, due to the short timeframe, we were unable to implement many of our ideas:<br/>    - We intended to create four distinct planets, each with its own unique inhabitants.<br/>    - In the Magic Book, we wanted to implement the ability to mix different elements to discover deadly synergies.<br/>    - We planned to add quest chains, mini-games, and spaceship defense mechanics to the game.<br/>Numerous ideas were suggested and documented, but their implementation came down to time and financial costs. I would like to remind you that our project is non-commercial, and everything you see has been done voluntarily by wonderful people!<br/><br/><br/><strong>OUR AMAZING TEAM</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>Thank you for your interest in the project! Please help Snoody save the planet and don't forget to leave any feedback about our game!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-16T04:35:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/008/0089e75096e24163280e57fffafff904.jpg", "website": "https://game-stables.notion.site/c3e1ed6c3a4f4197b15a2cb05af83fbe?v=1426ddbf149d44f196bed06cf5cc9d3c", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Stables"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Game Stables"], "esrb_rating": null}
