This is my first Ludum Dare Compo submission, yay!</p>\n<p>I really hate how bad I am at chess. The pieces keep jumping around through impossible spaces, and my king got mated inside a castle!?</p>\n<p>So here\u2019s a totally non-chess-like game, where your surrounding allies can support you, and pieces can\u2019t cross the whole board in a single turn.</p>\n<p>And you know what, let\u2019s forget the king. It\u2019s 2018, everyone\u2019s equal!

When that unit die, they lose.<br/>- Bring the king back 2: no secret, but the leader squad get a buff (x2 strength maybe?)<br/>- Stop the snowball: each time a squad is defeated, its controlling player get a skull mark to use (mark a tile to destroy)<br/>- Custom team (choose your loadout/formation)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/649fbd7ce6ec4e6405b51270d25a06e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AVAVT"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
