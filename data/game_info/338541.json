In contrary to the Atari's classic Pong, in Counter Pong you control both pads. The bottom pad is controlled directly using handlebar, while the top pad always moves in the opposite direction - that's why we call it mind switching game.  <br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Just touch and drag the handlebar at the bottom to move lower pad. The real catch is that upper pad goes in the opposite direction. Try to keep the ball in the game as long as you can. Each time you return the ball you get 1 point. The tricky part is that first 30 times when the ball hits the pad it becomes a little bit faster.<br/><br/>In order to pause game you just need to release the handlebar. But be aware that the ball will only stop if it goes away from the pad.<br/><br/>Let the challenge begin!<br/>Play Counter Pong", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T03:05:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4e983d883a48018a3ea2c00dc0b4825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Aleksandar Milosavljevic"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Aleksandar Milosavljevic"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
