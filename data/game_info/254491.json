Trade resources, buy ships and stations to fulfill contracts ! Dock at stations to buy and sell you wares or upgrade your ship, upgrade your technology to be more efficient and militarize your fleet to prevent piracy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will need to master both real-time action and long-term strategy: destroying a freighter has a direct impact on the economy, while declaring war will make your spaceflight environment slightly more hostile...</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>13 playable ships with weapon and engine upgrades</strong><br/>Build and fly fleets of fighters, bombers, cargos, corvettes or capital ships. Buy new engines and weapons.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Fast-paced combat with Newtonian flight, localized damage and joystick support</strong><br/>There is no speed limit in Helium Rain. You can fly at half a mile a second while aiming backwards. Aim for critical systems in order to disable ships, kill their crew or capture targets, and don't fly into asteroids.</li><li><strong>Complex economy model</strong><br/>Take advantage of a complex simulation of space trade to be the most competitive company.\u00a0</li><li><strong>A planetary system to explore</strong><br/>Explore around 25 sectors orbiting the gas giant Nema and its moons.</li><li><strong>Procedural contracts, world exploration, technology upgrades</strong><br/>Pick contracts and build your empire to become the largest company.</li><li><strong>Quick-action skirmish mode</strong><br/>Setup your fleet, pick an opponent and go into fighting action right away !</li></ul>\n\r\nA world that feels real\r\n<p>Your ships have generators, radiators, weapons, engines, cargo bays or life support systems - they all work together. Every thruster on your ship plays a role. Aim for engines to pin down your enemies, or send them spinning around by destroying power stations. Most ships have more than thirty individual parts ! You can customize the most important parts of your ships - your main engines, attitude control thrusters, weapons and hull colors.</p>\n<p>Your competitors are independent factions, companies with the same goal as yours - ruling the system. They will try to undercut you, or even attack you if you become a threat to them. But don't be too quick to destroy them, as war can break the supply of resources you depend on ! Attacking freighters will destroy resources, with the potential to cause an economic crisis.</p>\n\r\nRecommended system\r\n<ul><li>64-bits Windows or Linux system (32-bits systems are not supported)</li><li>Intel Core i5 or equivalent</li><li>GTX 970 or equivalent</li><li>4GB of RAM</li><li>5GB of free disk space</li></ul>\r\nLinux-specific support\r\n<p>Linux is fully supported, with the following caveats.</p>\n<ul><li>AMD users should launch the game with the \"-vulkan\" command-line parameter (full command \"HeliumRain.sh -vulkan\"), using the open-source radeonsi driver.</li><li>NVidia users can encounter a NVidia driver regression causing the game to render entirely white. Until this is fixed by NVidia, affected users should prefix the launch command with \"__GL_GlslUseCollapsedArrays=0\" (full command \"__GL_GlslUseCollapsedArrays=0 ./HeliumRain.sh\").
