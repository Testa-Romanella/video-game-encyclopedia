{"id": 55075, "slug": "mind-forever-voyaging-a", "name": "A Mind Forever Voyaging", "name_original": "A Mind Forever Voyaging", "description": "<p>A Mind Forever Voyaging (AMFV) is a 1985 interactive fiction game designed and implemented by Steve Meretzky and published by Infocom. The name is taken from book three of The Prelude by William Wordsworth:</p>\n<p>AMFV was not a conventional Infocom adventure, having only a single puzzle near the end of the game. Unlike most other Infocom titles, particularly those written by Steve Meretzky, the game had a serious tone and a political theme, attributes which the company would revisit with the following year's Trinity. The game is among Infocom's most respected titles, although it was not a commercial success. It was also the first of the \"Interactive Fiction Plus\" line, meaning that AMFV had greater memory requirements, unlike earlier Infocom games that used a less advanced version of the company's Z-machine interpreter. It is Infocom's seventeenth game. The game was explicitly intended as a polemical critique of Ronald Reagan's political policies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87b/87b222faa36f5b6241a60abc075e0a3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II", "Classic Macintosh", "Atari ST", "PC"], "developers": ["Infocom"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Infocom", "Commodore 128"], "esrb_rating": null}
