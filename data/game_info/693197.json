This game is made to be simple, \u00a0whacky and weird.</p>\n<p>It is a TTRPG made for 1 GM and several players. You play as old people, exploring strange ruins hidden beneath their retirement home, The Mandragoras.</p>\n<p>The system is a free adaptation of the Cthulhu hack system and fits on the recto. The other side of the document contains some lore elements and 3 random tables to explore the undergrounds !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T07:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/213/2139a1d8af9d1626eac07fcaf4879485.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spawny Toorte"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
