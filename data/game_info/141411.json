Before I knew it, I had created a game with a jetpack, just like Downwell. It just adds so much design opportunities for a frantic platformer that I couldn't help myself.<br/></p>\n<p>I've had trouble running the game in Chrome, but it seems to work fine in Firefox . I've also provided a link to a downloadable Windows Build if all else fails (Please fullscreen the game to allow for my hyper-wide aspect ratio).</p>\n<p>Please enjoy,</p>\n<p>Luke Archbell</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/229/22911a9b970050a5f7324c57ce07ac44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["LukeArchbell"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
