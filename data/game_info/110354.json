Each game was cobbled together, one person at a time, with nobody knowing what they would be working on until they got it. It was an experiment in collaboration and building on the work of others. It was also an exercise in creativity, letting go of intention and surrendering to the communal flow. It was a lot of fun!</p>\n<p>This track worked a little differently than the others. Because only 3 people signed up, they did it more like Photoshop Tennis. The team traded it back and forth a few times, evolving the block-pushing magnet game with more levels and puzzle mechanics.<br/></p>\n<p>Contributors:</p>\n<p>Jason Corbett<br/>Joe Mirizio<br/>Adrian Sandoval</p>\n<p>There were also Exquisite Corpse tracks in Unity, Twine, Phaser/HTML5, Analog.\u00a0 Check them out!\r\n</p>\n<p>The jam was inspired by the Exquisite Corpse parlor game, invented by the surrealists.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcb/bcb1af6f65ef692ee50e8dba8058c0a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhillyGameMechanics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
