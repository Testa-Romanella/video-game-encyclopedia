You have been selected to take part in \"The Tower Experiment\". This experiment involves navigating mazes, solving puzzles by finding keys, pressing switches, solving repeating rooms, surviving against dangers, and moving through teleporters. You may even have to use a jet pack!</p>\n<p>This game does not involve combat. You will be going through 4 levels with each having 5 floors/sections to finish. You will be assigned helper bots to assist you further in the rooms.</p>\n<p>This game was a labor of love and was originally a whole different game idea. If interested to see the behind the scenes of this game's development, a video will be coming out soon on the C.J. Cuypers Productions YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4sYXcoXwYlO2L49SO5Z50Q)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this small game!
