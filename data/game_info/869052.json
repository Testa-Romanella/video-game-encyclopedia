And now, you, a quite new and unexperienced worker, is the only person, except for the bugs, left on Station 12. As you recognise you need to leave before the station collapses on itself you realise you\u2019re in luck and not alone. To your disposal, your co-worker has left a highly advanced nano-material-based glove.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Equip the Gravitum. A powerful tool which lets you manipulate gravity to your own personal benefit. After you initialize it via the lab - Bind objects via a small black hole in order to climb obstacles. Throw heavy objects at will to break reinforced glass. Or jump and stand upon the ceiling to gain a new perspective \u2013 These are all things which you will need to do in order to both solve difficult physics-based puzzles and fiercely battle combat-ready enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But let us stop right there. The questions you have are surely already plenty. The only one that matters however, is if you indeed will reach the now lone escape pod in time to travel back to Earth.
