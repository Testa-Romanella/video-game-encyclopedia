Just use the scanner and look around the room.  The scanner will overlay any tacks it finds on top of the rooms picture.<br/><br/>Be careful though.  The North Pole likes the Elves to move in secret. <br/>Everytime you detect an Elf track, the North Pole can tell.  Fortunately, the Elf Tracker lets you clear the tracks.  Just tap an Elf track and the scanner will clear it.<br/><br/>However, if you detect too many tracks without clearing them, the North Pole will be able to locate your scanner and freeze it.  <br/><br/>As the LED's get into the red zone, snow will start coming your way to freeze you out.<br/><br/>Remember, Elves are magical and fly as well as walk.  So when you are searching for Elf tracks, make sure to look at everything, even the ceiling, you never know where they have been.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:52:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccc/ccc9a43da879f403caf42ffe6c75aeff.jpg", "website": "http://www.sleepydogsoftware.net/ElfTracker.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sleepy Dog Software"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Sleepy Dog Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
