You start in a lobby where you are presented with two wellness areas. One area is a single user scene where users can explore several guided meditations in serene environments. The second area is called \u201cThe Stream\u201d.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0The Stream is a multiplayer environment where users stand along a stream together and share their intrusive thoughts in anonymous environment. Users grab a thought container and speak their intrusive thoughts (e.g. fears, sadness, anxieties). The user drops their thought into the stream and watches as it floats away. In addition to the therapeutic benefits of speaking your fears, as you watch others' thoughts pass by you will soon realize that you are not alone. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Windows PC VR <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Must enable the following in Windows:\r\n  </p>\n<ol><li>Privacy/Microphone/Allow access to app</li><li>Privacy/Speech/Online speech recognition</li></ol>\n\n\n<p><strong>Button</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Action</strong>\n</p> <p>B\r\n      </p> <p>Create   Thought Object\r\n     </p> <p>Trigger\r\n      </p> <p>Record speech\r\n     </p> <p>Y, X, A\r\n      </p> <p>Menu\r\n     </p>\n\n\n<p>CONTRIBUTORS</p>\n<p>Steve R (https://www.steve18624.com/)<br/>Dillan Hoyos (https://dillanhoyos.github.io/)<br/>Cosche (https://www.artstation.com/cosche)\r\n<br/>\r\nMike Zhang (https://www.zhangmike.com/\r\n) <br/>\r\nGuy Rozen<br/>\r\nPai <br/>\r\nCelia <br/>\r\nXue <br/>\r\nAlexz <br/>\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Third Party Assets<br/></p>\n<p>Sound<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MJn3K5CO0o<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWMcR35D-cE<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh14Dv7PAN4\r\n<br/><br/>3D Assets <br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkRnUoXacHM<br/>\r\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/polygon-nature-low-pol...<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created for the DeepWell DTX + Global Game Jam - May Day Mental Health Jam 2022<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:22:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/443/4430eb49a5ae27d565ccf7b0f4c0a30b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dillanhoyosmusic", "Cosche", "steve18624"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
