Advise your agents as they deal with security, fugitive recovery, repossession cases, and more.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Hire freelance agents to help complete cases!  Every case has different requirements and with a wide variety of agents to choose from, finding the right agent for the case is essential. Expand your roster to accommodate more agents by completing caseloads and receiving rewards. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Whether it's security, repossession, fugitive recovery, or moonlighting, careful reading and planning are the keys to success. Ascertain the specific case requirements and bring your A-game to the table by sending the right agent to get the job done.<br/><br/><br/>Each agent has 5 stats with different values, ranging from 0 to 5. The value corresponds to the number of dice allocated when performing a stat roll.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Some cases offer diverse and immersive gameplay with genre and era-specific puzzles (read: mini-games). They are a mixture of cryptograms, digital and analog mechanics: reflex-based as well as mathematical challenges. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>By using cards, stat values are temporarily increased for dice rolls. Gear Cards have a tier value which indicates the rarity of the card, as well as a durability factor, indicating the total amount of uses the card has before it is removed from the inventory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>To root out the cancer gnawing at the city, use all the power and resources available to you: from your agents and era-accurate surveillance technology to friends in high places.<br/><br/>But look out \u2013 behind the curtains of this struggle for justice, a much bigger story is playing out. A secret organization with grand ambitions spread its influence over Seneca City, and it has you in its crosshairs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T08:00:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b2/4b2c414e527f3a26804a8110d5c6ebf9.jpg", "website": "https://www.rough-justice.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamma Minus UG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
