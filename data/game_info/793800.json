{"id": 793800, "slug": "emergency-game", "name": "Emergency Game", "name_original": "Emergency Game", "description": "<p>\n</p>\n<p>We got inspired by the game Contra and we wish to make the game similar in concept but an entirely different game. A fun and simple shooting-arcade style game to just relive gamers nostalgia. We consider this game as a very flexible game depends on what type of gamer you are. This game can be relaxing but can also be challenging. Players can sit-down and just enjoy the game however they like!</p>\n\n<p><strong>New Update! </strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Ver. 1.01</strong></p>\n<p>Hello everyone! \r\n  </p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a few weeks since the first time we post the game. Now, we are happy to announce that an update has finally arrived! \r\n  </p>\n<p>Please mind that this update is not a major update and there are still a couple more things to be done before we release a major update which is ver. 1.1! Without further ado, here are some notes for the update.\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>New Level Design\r\n  </li><li>Enemies\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>We have made a new, more robust design for our level. We have made the level much bigger, full of environments and more platforms! This allows player to explore and run around the level more.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Yes folks, enemies. We have added enemies that patrols the area within the level. They are placed in some points of the platform so that players will be given the chance to encounter one. A lot of work is still needed for the enemy AI, but as far as the progress goes, we are happy that enemies can finally appear in this update. \r\n  </p>\n<p>And so, that is a wrap for this update. We\u2019ll see you next time with our next update of the game. Thank you!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Team</strong><br/>Edyth Novian Putra \u2013 2440106163<br/>Elshad Ryan Ardiyanto \u2013 2440085096<br/>Patrick Alexander \u2013 2440106226<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/>A , D : Left - Right<br/>W , Space : Jump<br/>Left Mouse\u00a0Button : Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T06:34:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e3dde3aac72ed028abbf60ebf9eeba1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dhyox"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
