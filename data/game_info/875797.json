It can be played on any emulator or machine that supports ULAplus, an enhanced colour mode that is available on some emulators, clones and the ZX Spectrum Next. It will not work on a regular Spectrum.<br/><br/>This mod adds a\u00a0 flashlight effect to the game that gives it quite the spooky atmosphere. Two versions are available - the classic pumpkin version and the lurid green 'Silver Shamrock' edition. Each includes different music that was converted by Pedro Pimenta.<br/><br/>Instructions on how to get the game running properly on an emulator\u00a0 are available in this video.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T15:12:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d73a4152aaa2d508068ff52163257523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["highriser"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
