Just hitting \"attack\" over and over should hopefully be a terrible strategy after the 2nd or 3rd floors. A lot of fun mechanics are in place to give you lots of choice in battles, such as unique limited use abilities for main characters, the ability to charge up your attacks and buffs, and weakness protection that you will absolutely want to be breaking as much as you can.<br/><br/>Upon death, you'll lose everything except for any saved coin. You'll also keep any town unlocks, and if you're a farmer there's probably some fruit and veggies waiting for whatever new character you've chosen!<br/><br/>I'm putting this up on early access to hopefully get some opinions and suggestions on balancing and new features.<br/>Come help out on the discord here: https://discord.gg/udt4E9UaUk<br/><br/>The game is free to play and always will be.<br/>Currently there is very little content while I finish adjusting features.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T03:15:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/712/7121d12cba883e794cfa715c9151f3fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Syrup Surprise"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Syrup Surprise"], "esrb_rating": null}
