Follow me on Twitter at @BPOutlaws for updates.</p><p>Your goal is to get as far as possible, every 100m you trigger a Time Extend. The Ship covers distance faster than the Mech but the Mech is better for clearing out room to fly, gotta' balance back and forth between the two modes.</p><p>Enjoy it for free, link it around, and hit me up on Twitter if you put up a Let's Play or play it on a Twitch stream 'cause I love watching other people play my games.  Any donations will go toward making the full game!  Feedback is appreciated for when I make the full game.</p><p>If you want to participate in the discussion, give it a rating on the Ludum Dare site here and let me know what you think!:</p><p>http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&amp;uid=20860<br/></p><p>- Jeff</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/349091faf6b564560849aadc7555b2bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bulletproof Outlaws"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
