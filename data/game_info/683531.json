There are plenty of other characters throughout the game ranging from heroes to villains and even in some cases, friends. All of this leads up to the heartbreaking scene at the end of the canonical ending with the great leader himself John Xina preparing and ultimately performing your execution. The crowd does not cheer despite the fact that you did not succeed your social credit score test, but mourns the death of a potentially great citizen lost to the whims of filthy capitalism and democracy. The attention to detail throughout all aspects of this game can be seen in each and every room from the reception desk to your own home with each and every character able to be spoken to with such witty and introspective commentary such as \"Love the Mets\" \"Your mom\" and \"Please help I'm being forced to write this review by John Xina and the CCP and if I don't complete it by Sunday they'll kill my family\". Such depth cannot be overlooked when making an authentic gaming experience and The Therapist Terrorist did not fall short of expectations. I would highly recommend this game to anyone seeking Culture, Good Times, and of course that sweet sweet Social Credit.\u00a011/10.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>- William Eyelash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T04:59:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/75961362c64b745ab0482fa57e33ea5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Therapist Terroist"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
