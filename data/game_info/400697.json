This is the first time I've ever actually used the export function in godot so I didn't know you had to manually tell it to include files that aren't explicitly godot resources :/</p>\n<p>I can't upload a fix for this because of the judging period, so I\u00a0guess I'm just screwed. You won't get any random events in game, which is the whole point of the game. You will get random battles when moving on the map, but that's it. Sorry.</p>\n\n<p>Made for the Text Only Game jam.</p>\n<p>Sorry that there's no dragons, I guess I didn't read the front page very carefully. I thought the theme was just text only.</p>\n<p>You lead a barbarian tribe in the 4th century AD to likely famine and disease. Set during the exciting period of the decline of the western roman empire.</p>\n<p>I wanted to do wayyyy more, so it's in a rough state, but I hope you at least find something enjoyable about it.</p>\n<p>No real assets used besides open source fonts.</p>\n<p>All the music and sound effects were composed by myself in Ableton Live. I was going for a kind of Age of Empires feel.</p>\n<p>I've uploaded a web build here, but be warned I have not tried it at all. I'd recommend the mac, linux, or windows download.</p>\n<p>If you like the music, you can download it or listen at:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/marblecake-1/4th-century-ad</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T03:29:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d1/4d1e04cf5b7abdd4619f85b42cd98c02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sevensidedmarble"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
