Use the floatyness of your drone to avoid obstacles, gain powerups and maintain your speed!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was developed by Team 07 at FutureGames as part of Game Project 1 guided by the theme of future transportation. We were mostly inspired by Mario mini games, as well as endless runner games such as temple run. Our goal was to make a game with physics-based, floaty movement.\u00a0Much like in endless runner games, the player\u2019s character is only moving forward, but here they are gaining momentum that is lost while bumping into an obstacle. Maintaining the momentum is crucial to reduce the distance between player and enemy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our target audience were children 8-12 years old. The process of making the game was very intense but rewarding thanks to the effort of incredibly dedicated group. The project taught us a lot about the value of good communication in a team, time management, how to track a progress in a group project and importance of prefabs in Unity.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T20:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1c/d1c852b67bcba2e32b5e008d02dbbbea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
