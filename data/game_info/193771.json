There are power-ups that will increase your tongue speed or increase how many flies you can catch at once. Also there are bees to avoid as they will paralyze your tongue for a couple seconds.</p><p>It seemed like a great idea on paper, but as people played it, it didn't seem all that fun. So I shelved the idea.</p><p>The game is for 1-4 players (One player mode was going to be a beat the clock mode, but it was never implemented).  It's best to use gamepad/controllers but it also supports joint keyboard play (which gets crazy with four players).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a87/a8708fdb7abb3e99f06ce8dd11f1c508.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greg Squire"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
