{"id": 53356, "slug": "killswitch", "name": "Kill Switch", "name_original": "Kill Switch", "description": "<p>Kill Switch (stylized as kill.switch) is a third-person shooter video game developed by Namco USA in 2003 for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows. A Game Boy Advance adaptation was released in 2004. The GBA game was created independently of Namco, due to a licensing deal with Destination Software.</p>\n<p>The most distinguishing characteristic of Kill Switch is its cover system, a mechanic that has the player character taking cover behind objects and around corners in a manner similar to Namco's own Time Crisis series of light gun shooters as well as Koei's third-person shooter WinBack and Konami's stealth game Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. However, Kill Switch was the first third-person shooter to feature the cover system as its core game mechanic, though Gears of War would popularize it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-26T11:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff6/ff6ac1941b23459e065b5f6c0be2288c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.56, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 17, "beaten": 33, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 34, "suggestions_count": 502, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 34, "platforms": ["Xbox", "Game Boy Advance", "PlayStation 2", "PC"], "developers": ["NAMCO", "Visual Impact", "The Bitmap Brothers", "Namco USA", "Namco Hometek"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Namco", "Destination Software", "Hip Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
