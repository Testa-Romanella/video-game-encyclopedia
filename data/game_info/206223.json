While adventuring, the player will face an onslaught of monsters who drop raw materials for\u00a0loot . Using quick reflexes and timely combos, the player can emerge victorious from the adventure, returning to the shop for a new day of profitable exchange.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first solo Unity project, and it is technically limited by my coding ability at that time. I tried to create something where the daily grind was acceptable, but not a reward in itself.\u00a0There is quite a bit of design space available to improve the gameplay aspects of both shop management and adventure combat.\u00a0Ideally, players will realize their path through life should be looking for adventures that support their growth, rather than succumbing to a daily grind.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67f/67fa1bdaf899f69a12a9f8763de1973e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eastbayeff"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
