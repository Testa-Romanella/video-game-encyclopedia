You never know what you're gonna get. But I did not know about Cosmic Works. They always give us the best. \"</p>\n<p>We all have had the unstoppable desire to put on our sneakers and go running, running without a route or destination. Feel the breeze on your face, see a beautiful sunset or how the moon rises in the sky accompanied by the twinkling stars as you run, just run. Or not?</p>\n<p>Join our intrepid and tireless runner for his long, long journey, because there is nothing better than running as if there were no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Dodge the obstacles you encounter along the way; jump boxes, rocks, slide under stubborn cows that block your way, be careful with suicidal birds and break the fences, that there are no barriers to the field.</p>\n<p>With a careful 8bit retro aesthetic, both graphically and in sound, the game offers quality and entertainment in equal parts in short but exciting games. The small details introduced make it unique; changing atmosphere day / night, smooth and detailed animations, even grows the character's beard!</p>\n<p>Run now! Run to be free!
