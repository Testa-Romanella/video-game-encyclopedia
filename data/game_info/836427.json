The only thing stopping you from razing the entire city to the ground\u00a0is Punchatron, the giant robot that originally captured you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Will you emerge victorious this time? Or will your reign of terror finally be brought to an end?</p>\n<p>#+-// Controls //-+#</p>\n<p>WASD: Move forward, backwards and strafe left/right</p>\n<p>Hold Left Shift: Aim View</p>\n<p>While holding shift, Left Mouse Click: Fire missiles</p>\n<p>My thoughts on the game:<br/>This is my first game jam entry and I learned a lot about how to approach game development by entering this jam. Because I am very new to this process and I\u00a0didn't have much of a plan when I started, I\u00a0have run out of time. So there's no audio and you can't even exit out of the game (which I\u00a0should probably have learned how to do first!).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This lack of completeness is a combination of my inexperience as a developer as well as a lack of time to include everything I\u00a0wanted to\u00a0before the deadline hit.\u00a0I hope whoever takes the time to play this little attempt at a game will still have fun with it regardless. Thanks!<br/></p>\n<p>Update:<br/></p>\n<p>Okay, I quickly added a win/lose screen as well as a little bit of audio for some ambience! Very minor stuff but hopefully this will at least create a little bit more of a complete experience!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T14:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ac/1ac0c4f7ad673d145c98643089adf5ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yellow Feather Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
