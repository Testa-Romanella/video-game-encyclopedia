Bitsy's alright - I might give it another go some other time - but M\u00f4si generates a nice big grid of rooms that don't have to be manually linked, which was very handy throughout.<br/></p>\n<p>If you're curious about the project described in this game, here's a picture of the work-in-progress. It still needs a proper watch case I can fit a strap to (and the ability to hibernate without losing track of time), but otherwise I feel as though it's not too bad for an early effort!<br/></p>\n\r\n^A photograph of a small LCD screen in a 3D-printed housing.
