The theme was \"Your Life is Currency\".<br/><br/>In this game you are created with a finite amount of \"life\" or \"time\"\u00a0that your character has available to them. You can spend it on things that we choose to spend our own lives on. Education, persistence, love, etc... We spend our lives on these things for the pursuit of something, something we can accomplish or achieve.</p>\n<p>This game is intended to make you think about what things you commit yourself to in your life and how they sometimes can help, sometimes can be mistakes, and how sometimes we never reach the end. Whatever the end really is.</p>\n<ul><li>Creating a block spends life</li><li>Jumping spends life</li><li>Life can be forfeited at the skull</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Created using:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Procreate(iPad)</li><li>Photoshop</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T04:45:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/868/868bc0096248f0fb6ed615958096a7cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tyhan1"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
