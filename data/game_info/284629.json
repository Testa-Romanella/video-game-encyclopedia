Join our heorine and her party as she navigates unhelpful police officers, Meth\u00a0\u00a0Heads, and faces the remnants of the KISS Army in her quest to recover her beloved moped, Pinkie Pi.\u00a0 (Not a parody of Grand Theft Auto. Perhaps after the developer plays GTA she might parody it.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T03:47:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62a/62a8265622fcd4615643bea824d6d033.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["sinisterporpoise2"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
