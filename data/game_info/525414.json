I'm so bad with story telling or english<br/>And the gamebalance also take soooo long to balance. Try it over and over again, add new tower mean new balance for enemy wave, I'm so tired is not as fun and simple as I thought it would be <br/>Overall I had so much fun with RPG Maker MZ, I'm still learning but for now it's fun to use, will experiment with more smaller games latter<br/>The plugin system is take a lot time for me to learn, feels like learning new framework<br/>I will upload the sourcecode and project later, if anyone want try play arround with it<br/>But still a lot work to do since the code is so messy<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T05:30:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08f/08fdbbbbfc1f2567080482774ccedf6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["UnwantedFriedChicken"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
