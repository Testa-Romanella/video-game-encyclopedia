Also the volume settings are not mapped yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Press ESC in game to open the pause menu</strong>, when you have <strong>33 rocks</strong> you have to<strong> go to the pile of rocks at the centre and touch it.</strong></p>\n<p>Story and controls are explained in-game. We advise you to read the instructions :D</p>\n\n<p>We hope you'll enjoy it even though it is still unbalanced and incomplete :)</p>\n\n<p>If you have any feedback, ideas, and suggestions please do write them in the comments, thank you for your feedback!</p>\r\nPATCH NOTES(1.0.1):\r\n<p>There were 2 small unintended bugs in the original jam version:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>The player flips the sprite when oscillating while idle</li><li>The player oscillates while going up and down</li></ul>PATCH NOTES(1.0.2):<ul><li>After several jam playtesters told me it was hard to pick rocks I noticed that the velocity needed to bend down was only taken on the X component, so going up and down didn't contribute. Now it is fixed and it is easier.</li></ul>\n<p>The above bugs are corrected now, but <strong>there is a\u00a0(JAM VERSION) downloadable</strong> if you want to play <strong>the original game for voting</strong>. The original game with those bugs is also <strong>much harder</strong>, so you can play it if the game feels too easy now! :D</p>\r\nAuthors:\r\n<p>Iacopo Regoli | Game design, game programming\r\n</p>\n<p>Hilary Palazzolo | Graphic design, game design | Instagram</p>\r\nExternal Credits:\r\n<p><strong>Music from </strong><strong>https://mixkit.co/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T11:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/392/392a9229ad6685a17cf012c8c4fcbe30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["regoli", "itslizzyart"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
