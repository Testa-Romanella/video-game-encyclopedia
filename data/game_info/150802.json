One of the bugs is in the main menu, when you press the button \"play\" to play sometimes doesn\u00b4t work, you just have to push it a couple more times in diferent spots of the button. It\u00b4s not finished, it was more of a learning game. I did it all myself. Hope you like it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfb/bfbf6421184d9533e57bd56d8c86fa08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["pedro"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
