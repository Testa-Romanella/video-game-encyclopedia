We examine the inner space of the individual who dies (performs an act of self-liberation) and has not yet entered a new form of existence. In the making of this project we are relating to the book The Psychedelic Experience (by Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, and Richard Alpert, first edition: University Books, New York 1964), in which the Bardo experience was analyzed in the context of the total loss of subjective identity.<br/>We divided the virtual space into stages that cannot be explored autonomously \u2013 their visuals and purpose are based on a specific journey in a certain direction. According to The Tibetan Book of the Dead, they are Kyenay bardo, Milam bardo, Samten bardo, Chikhai bardo, Ch\u00f6nyi bardo, and Sidpa bardo. We identify the participant in their transmigration process with the supra-individual \u201cmental body\u201d (jid-kji lus), \u201cmind\u201d (sems) and \u201csubtle consciousness\u201d (rnam-shes p\u2019ra-mo).<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Immersive bardo experience is possible thanks to six degrees of freedom \u2013 6DoF. The participant has the ability to move, explore and change position in terms of moving forward / backward, up / down, left / right in three perpendicular axes, combined with orientation changes by rotating around three perpendicular axes \u2013 bend (coronal axis), jump (transverse axis) and tilt (sagittal axis). To expand the unfettered impression of embodiment, the exhibition space has been mapped, and the participant can interact with the surrounding simulation. After the experience finishes, the participant becomes a Delog \u2013\u201cdaa-log is the deceased, who \u2018returned from dead\u2019 to tell what he had seen and lived on the other side Delog is someone who has died and left the body, after some time to return and continue to live\u201d.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Operating system: Windows 10 64-bit, Windows 11 64-bit</p>\n<p>Supported headsets: HTC Vive, HTC Vive Pro, Oculus Quest via cable link, Valve Index</p>\n<p>Room size requirements : minimum required is 2 by 2 meters.
