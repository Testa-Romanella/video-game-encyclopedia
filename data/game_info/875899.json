Watch your back as the old clown performer never left and he wants The Fun Zone back. You can store distractions in your backpack on your left shoulder and pull them out whenever you need them! The clown can't see very well and relies on his hearing, don't let yourself believe he can't see you though.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong></p>\n<p>- This game was made in less than a week as a challenge to myself as a solo developer to expand my knowledge!</p>\n<p>- There is no tutorial, you have to learn how to avoid the clown &amp; how to escape all on your own using just the world around you!</p>\n<p>- This is an early version, some things I'm going to add in the future:</p>\n<p>-- A short tutorial on how to climb, use your backpack, distract the clown, etc.</p>\n<p>-- Story pieces, behind the scenes this game actually has a story, not much of this is actually shown in the game itself besides a few items you can find</p>\n<p>-- Secrets &amp; extra rooms / levels. I've really enjoyed working on this short project and I'd like to expand it in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T15:57:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56d/56d4254b1dd1d0884a5c3e76779cb7cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rigged"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
