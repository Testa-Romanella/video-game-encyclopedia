I have no experience programming visual novels AT ALL, so expect a sad excuse of a visual novel. I'm also pretty mediocre at art so the sprites and CGs are also quite depressing, andddd I suck at writing so expect the writing to be bad as well. I lowkey just made this for myself--\u00a0Really, why even play this game? Click away while you still can! :&gt;</p>\n<p>I also only own the sprites and CGs, I don't own the BGs used as well as the music.\u00a0</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Watch me regret this in the future.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:28:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/049/0499f5f434f938d4a29a6c0585e228a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["interestelle"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
