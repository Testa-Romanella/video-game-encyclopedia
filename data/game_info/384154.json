The music is celestial and the graphics are vivid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trailer &amp; Screenshots</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n<p>Skyous\u00a0is available on\u00a0Steam,\u00a0App Store\u00a0and\u00a0Google Play.</p>\n<br/><br/>\n\n<p><strong>Dunedin, Skyous and resources</strong></p>\n\n<p>It all started in Dunedin, New Zealand.<br/>That magical place made me enter the world of Game Development and conjure Skyous in a day's night. I will not speak of Dunedin. She's too charming to be manifested with words.<br/><br/>So I joined Unity earlier this year, 2019. With regard to the dangerous idea of cross-platform game development. I pushed forward. For I desired experience in both fields. I took a big risk with Skyous. For it was both aside and a full-time project. On some occasions I will bring fourteen hours a day in development, and at others, I would skip out for a week or more. I did not realize how demanding a fully developed game is. It's like .. a real baby.<br/><br/>For the\u00a0<strong>resources</strong>, the audio you hear in Skyous is entirely made by a British sound engineer, few graphical assets were purchased and fewer still are the purchased scripts. The rest was hand made.<br/><br/>Due to my non-existent experience in gaming. I made Skyous a 2D game with a 3D concept. Skyous should have been a 3D game, however.<br/><br/>Whenever this version becomes even a slight success (production break even point reached). I will make a better and professional 3D version with advanced functionality like multiplayer.<br/><br/>Skyous production cost : -<strong>$17,800 USD</strong>\u00a0( mostly time )<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Reality Shock</strong><br/><strong>T</strong>hree\u00a0weeks in a whirlpool with Game influencers, journalists and publishers left me in awe.<br/>My main focus was on Youtubers/Streamers. From the two hundred personal emails I sent, only seven responses were yielded. Five demanded I pay a huge sum upfront and the remaining two apologized for no longer participating in Game Reviews and generously \"wish you luck\"-ed me.<br/><br/>Now I come from a totally remote industry, electronics, electricity, and software. My variant skills, while resilient, do not even remotely intersect with social media marketing. To add insult to injury, I myself don't value/use social-media.\u00a0Which only means ...\u00a0\u00a0???<br/><br/>\"<em>Don't suffocate over it, it's just a game</em>\" - I keep reminding myself ;]<br/><br/>I will try and publish few posts here in there (by that I mean this post actually). Maybe by some luck, a Youtuber would review Skyous for the fun of it.<br/><br/>But in shorts, If I am going to name one big mistake in my first unity project.<br/>I would call up\u00a0<strong>digital marketing</strong>. It surely requires it's own time and resources.<br/><br/>A friend of mine spoke of Kickstarter. Perhaps I will understand what that is soon.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Feedback &amp; Contact\u00a0</strong><br/>Leave me feedback by using this eloquent\u00a0Google survey.<br/>Also, let's talk about Skyous &amp; You.
