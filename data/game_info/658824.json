Since I'm mostly doing this for fun, I\u00a0don't have the time/interest in making a bunch of nice sound effects, high quality\u00a0character/background art, or making things look super great in general. My main goal was for this to just work. And it does. So I'm pretty satisfied with it. <br/></p>\n<p>i feel like i should say\u00a0MOST of the sounds were not made by me i do not claim to own them.\u00a0besides the file select music, i did not make or claim to own any of the music. does my roblox character count as roblox property? the backgrounds i got off pexel.com. im not profiting off of this game so i should be good regardless..?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T09:55:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e99/e99869e91784b97a2c82cb483cc2c383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bluuleef"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
