You have to protect your base (and yourself!) from relentless zombies. These zombies do tend to explode a lot. However, you can take advantage of that. Killing a zombie next to many others will cause a chain reaction, making them all explode! Don't let the zombies break your base. And remember, you have to take care of yourself as well!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:                                                                                                           Movement: WASD Reload: R Switch weapons: Numbers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94b2640eb424e4c375102b3fd8d05fdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Prosnype"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
