Each spell has randomised stats like power, speed, and range, and they can even have special effects like burning the foe, or draining their health!\r\n</p>\n<p>But that's not all! You can also buy magic potions in the shop. They give you special effects too, but you can activate them at any time!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>With thousands of different spells, and different items available in the shop each time you play, no two playthroughs are the same!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T11:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a2/4a24f0d7cde109b2c461fec3cdb07b54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SC37Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
