Marine ecosystems are what diversify and make our oceans look beautiful. Each of these ecosystems are different and rely on the particular balance of the oceans properties in the area.\u00a0One of those ecosystems are Kelp Forests. Kelp Forests are cool marine ecosystems which consists of huge stalks of kelp covering vast areas. Urchins are common in these types of ecosystems, and they maintain a balance in the Kelp Forests. However, global warming and climate change is causing the delicate balance of many marine ecosystems to shift. The most drastic example is shown all the time with coral bleaching in coral reefs. In Kelp Forests, they depend on cooler waters and other predators to keep urchins in check. Because of climate change, the urchins main predator has dwindled largely in size, letting urchin populations boom and devour Kelp Forests. We have to maintain a focus on stopping climate change as well as prevent pollution of our oceans from trash to have a chance at fully preserving our oceans.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Source:\u00a0<em>https://www.npr.org/2021/03/31/975800880/in-hotter-climate-zombie-urchins-are-wi...</em></p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>An urchin will spawn at the bottom every couple of seconds, attempting to eat all the kelp that is on screen. Your job is to click as many urchins as you can to keep them away from the kelp. The longer you keep the kelp alive and the more urchins you click, the higher your score!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T08:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/9247541c0d1de07616153196f400cd7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["KarlVM12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
