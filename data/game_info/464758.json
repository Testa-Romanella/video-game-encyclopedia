You control the character by pressing the left and right arrows to pilot the little capsule skiier down the hill and you can pause using the escape button. Hitting trees and rocks damages you and send you back to a last safe position. Everything is very rough. My best advice is weave back and forth, I didn't have time to tune anything well or adequately design the level so I can just wish you best of luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd6a4a45ab4ad125df58d0b8ef36e906.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mr. bubs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
