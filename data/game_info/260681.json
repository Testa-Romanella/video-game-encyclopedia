{"id": 260681, "slug": "tankdestruction", "name": "TankDestruction", "name_original": "TankDestruction", "description": "<strong>TankDestruction </strong>is a fast-paced multiplayer action game. Equip the abilities you wish to use, and join the battle on large-scale maps with up to 20 other players! <br/><br/>To win, capture the towers controlled by the enemy team - but be careful, as they are protected by powerful AI-controlled turrets which have to be destroyed first. <br/>Spend too long destroying them, and enemy tiger tanks will start to swarm all over you - they enjoy derping around, but they'll destroy you all the same!<br/><br/>When duelling other players, you rely on your speed to survive, so try not to crash into a tree! You'll look a bit silly (and a bit helpless) if you do.<br/><br/>TankDestruction is free to play. For those who wish to support the game, there is an option to purchase a premium account which provides cosmetic bonuses only, such as being able to equip different skins.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Use WASD to move.<br/>Left click to fire the main canon - this is your long-range weapon.<br/>Right click to fire the machine guns - these guns are only effective at short range.<br/>Use the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 buttons to activate your special abilities.<br/>Hold the W key if your tank is stuck upside-down.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/213/213686fcabaf15596b5e8af2d79baf3d.jpg", "website": "http://TankDestruction.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TankDestruction", "Joehot200"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joehot200"], "esrb_rating": null}
