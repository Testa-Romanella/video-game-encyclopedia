At one point in the game, I made a game with the Slots RPG combination and that got me wondering what a real Slots RPG game would look like. So I dropped the game and started taking notes of what came to mind. I also drew some mockups to have a better idea of what I had in mind. 5 months later, here's King Cashing! So, hum, thanks Kairosoft!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:23:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a0747870bf310148eb9f6d5a127806e.jpg", "website": "http://www.kingcashing.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Productions Multimage"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Productions Multimage"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
