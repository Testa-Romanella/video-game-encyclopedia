Don't say I didn't try to warn you.<br/></p>\n<p>Play as a cube with the ability to create walls by dashing.\u00a0Use your walls to bounce the ball into the enemy's goal, while defending a goal of your own. Score 10 points under the time limit to win the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Use\u00a0WASD to move and mouse/left click to aim and dash!</p>\n<p>But watch out! The ball and other spherical objects can kill you, so think before you dash!</p>\n<p>Also press 'M' to mute the music. It is a little repetitive.</p>\n<p>Welcome to, \"Watch Out For the Ball!\" Ball!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This submission matches the theme by binding dash mechanics and wall spawning together. On top of that, one of the balls that can kill you, is the same ball that you need to use to score. This game is built to run on Windows and Mac, although the file attached is Windows only.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game and I would like to thank my friends for helping me play-test it.\u00a0It was created using Unity 5.6 using just the default objects and my code, with the music made in GarageBand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Please let me know what you think! All types of feedback are helpful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Vince</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d1/5d162959c66d1726d47b2f9bcbdd446f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ImaPopAnyway"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
