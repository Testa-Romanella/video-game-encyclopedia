Then combine their powers and play through the storyline.</p>\n<p>Each minigame has unique mechanics but limited interactivity. The complexity comes once you start assisting one from the other. The central buttons are for destroying a thing, and in most cases this is what you want to start with.</p>\n<p>Buttons with rounded corners need to be clicked, buttons with square corners can be held down. The menu items open on hover (its a pure css menu).</p>\n<p>Have fun, and please support myself and all your favorite creators!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T02:58:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63c3ad7d3edce4f466c4b57a647674ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kygron"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
