The theme was \"to make new with old\". It was a gamejam created by the french Youtuber named Atomium.<br/>For this project my team was composed of :</p>\n<p>Graphists : <strong>Axel De Nardi, Chloe Horellou</strong><br/>Developers : <strong>Jo\u00ebl Huang, Mathieu Rakoto (It's me !)</strong></p>\n<p>This gamejam dates of the 20th July 2018 and a first prototype was developed at this moment. Unfortunalety, we couldn't finish what we wanted to do.\u00a0<br/>Lack of experience and many features were too much work for us and our final prototype had lot of bugs. There are lot of GFX that we could'nt import and mains features<br/>didn't work well. For me it was too sad :(. So I decided to finish the project now for respect of the work of my partners!<br/>Here, all main features that we wanted to develop are present with GFX, SFX, animations etc. SFX and music were not created by us but the rest is handmade by graphists and developers.\u00a0<br/>The game it is not over and can be improved with other levels but I prefer to stop here because it is only a prototype. Oh last remark, it is made with Unity :)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Story:\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p>For this Gamejam, we inspired of recycling system hence the name of our game \"Bubble Recycle\". Player controls a character who must cross rooms to kill enemies and then to pick up objects.<br/>With these objects, he can mix up different elements to create new objects which can be used during his adventure. It is to create new with old! There is not a real plot but this is our\u00a0<br/>original idea.</p>\n<p>In this prototype you can create 3 objects : Ink Bomb, Flash Bomb et Light Stick. I let you discover how to create them and their effect!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls :</em></strong></p>\n<p>Move character or\u00a0 select in inventory : buttons \"z\",\"q\",\"s\" and \"d\" (sorry I am french so it is azerty keyboard)<br/>Shoot : Arrow keys<br/>Use secondary weapon : touch \"f\"<br/>Open/Close inventory : touch \"a\"<br/>Interact with ennemis/items, selection in inventory : touch \"e\"<br/>Drop object after selecting in inventory : touch \"t\"\u00a0<br/>Craft in inventory (with objects in 2 slots) : touch \"r\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>To leave a comments logs in with itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T12:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c10/c1016f01cff53d69fafc189dd65fef19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kynokaze"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
