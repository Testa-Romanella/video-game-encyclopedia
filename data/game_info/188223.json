(itch)", "description": "<p>A little lead ball has roused the ire of Thunderhead Volca, the Thunder\r\n God of Volcanoes. Overreacting to the slight, the hammer of Thunderhead\r\n tries to smash the ball into the magma. \r\n</p>\r\nIt's Hammer Time!\r\n<p>A competitive local-multiplayer for two or more players. The player controlling the \r\nball with the arrow keys/WASD must try to stay on the platforms for as \r\nlong as possible - the player controlling the hammer must smash the platforms to send the ball into the volcano.</p>\n<p>After\r\n one round, the players swap controls and compete for the best time. The\r\n player who remained on the platforms for the longest wins the game.</p>\n\r\nCrew\r\n<p><em>Environment Artist:</em><br/>\u00a0- Tarsha Schaller<br/>https://www.artstation.com/art...<br/></p>\n<p><em><br/>Hammer Artist:</em><br/>\u00a0- Connor Muller<br/>https://www.artstation.com/art...<br/></p>\n<p><em><br/>Level Artist:</em><br/>\u00a0- Flynn McMurray<br/>https://www.artstation.com/art...<br/></p>\n<p><em><br/>Level Design/Sound Design:</em><br/>\u00a0- Jayden Smitts<br/>https://twitter.com/jaydendev<br/></p>\n<p><em><br/>UI/UX Design:</em><br/>\u00a0- Nicholas Stewart<br/>You are here<br/>https://www.tumblr.com/blog/nd...<br/></p>\n<p><em><br/>Technical Programmer:</em><br/>\u00a0- Jay Johnston<br/>(Link Pending)</p>\n<p><em>UI Programmer:</em><br/>\u00a0- Cassandra Mills<br/>(Link Pending)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Special Thanks to: <br/>- https://www.purple-planet.com/<br/>- AIE Melbourne Campus<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fb/3fbace9293518ccc0778abc451b7fe8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jade Stewart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
