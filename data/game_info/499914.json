I made multiple errors when creating variables and assigning its values, and I got multiples errors when placing the <strong>global variable float </strong>distance in a private class. The drop-down method list in C# is useful, and it made the coding easy. The video two also introduced me to\u00a0how to create a ground plain for collider that allows the mouse to click to generate multiple sphere colliders without debugging errors.\u00a0 The other challenging problem I was facing was creating the ground click. I did not realize not saving the code in the C# environment, so I was getting debugging error whenever I click an object on the plain. The video three walk me through to build my sprint 01 half-game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T04:54:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/297/297a4fee2d391a931e75e93a071bb3a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["opokukwafo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
