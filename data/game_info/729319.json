It thus contains themes and language not suited for the faint of heart.<br />\nThe current version of Clover has been in the works for over 4 whole years with effort worth thousands of hours by over 40 contributors, and with an estimated play time of over 100 hours, Clover is sure to bring you moments filled with joy, frustration, laughter and suffering!<br />\nSo what are you waiting for? Take on a journey as Professor Stump\u2019s Pok\u00e9dex aide and battle tough rivals and Gym Leaders as you travel through fields, oceans, deserts and mountains!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a1/9a14992c6ce1fdabcd9b24b8ac35d902.jpg", "website": "https://poclo.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Self-Published"], "esrb_rating": null}
