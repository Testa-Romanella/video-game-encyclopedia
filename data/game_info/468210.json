Theme is \"out of control\"<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W/Up - Accelerate</p>\n<p>A/D/Left/Right - Rotate</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Shoot</p>\n<p>Shift - Zoom camera out</p>\n<p>All of these actions consume \"control\". The less control you have, the more unstable the universe becomes, and stranger more erratic things will happen. Your goal is to blow up asteroids until you run out of shields. Asteroids will sometimes drop control crystals which will give you some more control when you touch them.\u00a0Bumping into other things will drain your shields, especially planets. If you run out of control, you'll have to hope you drift into a worm hole to replenish your supply.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f37/f37570bec4765dd5790d81c0e5a858cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["msciortino17"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
