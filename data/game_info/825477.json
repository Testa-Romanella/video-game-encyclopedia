{"id": 825477, "slug": "chromatic-king", "name": "Chromatic King", "name_original": "Chromatic King", "description": "<p>Made for:</p>\n<p>Mini Jam 111: Colors\u00b2<br/></p>\n<p>In Chromatic King your goal is to train a useless Champion to defeat the Chromatic King who is trying to segregate all colors in the world. The training is done in a simulation where you must repeatedly kill an evolving Champion until they are ready to face the King.</p>\n<p>In the final battle you will play as the Champion and hopefully defeat the Chromatic King.</p>\n<p>My thought process for the theme was obviously incorporating colors into all the enemies and the boss and trying to make it an underlying part of the story. For the limitation I felt that killing the Champion in order to help them and then finally playing as the enemy you've been fighting the whole game in the final mission fit with the idea of being both the protagonist and the antagonist.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T05:47:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da96708120f4a4382fa979c8c4912926.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NectarZuzi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
