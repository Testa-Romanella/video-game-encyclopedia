Between a meditative pine-forest, standing stones and the ghosts of a prehistoric person, the user interacts with objects to gain insight into a forgotten individual\u2019s past lifeworld.</p>\n<p>This project was inspired by philosophical leanings in archaeology \u2013 phenomenology and extended landscape theory. That would be walking through the landscape and imagining what it may have been like with the cultural ephemera available to us today. Through the lens of each, <em>Trace</em> attempts to explain the influences landscape may have had on the prehistoric person. By placing emphasis on creative-writing, social agency and experiencing the land, <em>Trace </em>aims to question the user on how it is we decipher the past.\r\n</p>\n<p>Submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MSc in International Heritage Visualisation at the Glasgow School of Art 2017. <strong>If you want to learn more, feel free to contact me at developer@rorypeace.co.uk!</strong></p>\n<p><em>With special thanks to Diessa for providing music and sound:\u00a0https://diessa.bandcamp.com/, and Emma Leach in providing help with concept art.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f3922eb61012c76e374a9430cb8ad2bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["rorypeace"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
