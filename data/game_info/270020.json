Only problem is; you have never trained before, and nor are you fit. In a fair world, you would be constantly eating the other athletes' dust!\u00a0You could give up, but that's for losers; instead you take an unconventional route.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To win, you will need to cheat your way through the system as much as possible. Do anything at all that could benefit your cause, including cutting corners, magical\u00a0potions, vandalism and straight-up murder! Watch out for Race Officials however, as they patrol the course, wary of wrongdoers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 72nd Weekly Game Jam in a bit over five days. The theme was \"finish line\".</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Left click to use held item, right click to hide the held item.</p>\n<p>WASD or arrows to move and Q to discard the held item.</p>\n\n<p>All artwork was made by myself, and the awesome soundtrack was made by Jono Heydeman. (Shout out to him!)</p>\n<p>The game is not completely finished, and some features including levels are locked off. There is however, an endless mode, ready for you to play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79cd46737b1b9a7b78a790991916bb7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JUSTCAMH"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
