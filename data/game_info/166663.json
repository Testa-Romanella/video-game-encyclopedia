It uses a 3-layer feed-forward neural network. The network is provided with an initial training and gets better each time it crashes.</p>\n<p>I also took the opportunity to experiment with shaders. I use custom shaders for:</p>\n<ul><li>Skybox</li><li>Terrain (geometry shader)</li><li>Coins. Hologram effect</li><li>Trail.
