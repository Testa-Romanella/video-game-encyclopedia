{"id": 105464, "slug": "a-queen-and-her-hive", "name": "A Queen and Her Hive", "name_original": "A Queen and Her Hive", "description": "<p><em>A Queen and Her Hive</em> is a strategy game with bees: Think \"Civilization bee!\" As queen, you are charged with deciding where to found hives and how to assign jobs to your subjects. With these two powers, you must make sure your kingdom gathers enough honey to survive the winter, defends against hungry bears, and roots out zombie infiltration. To what greatness can you lead the kingdom?</p>\n<p>This game is experimental! Expect quick deaths, but don't give up! Click on icons for help and explanations. Move the camera by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen. Select hives with Q and E (Great if your camera wanders far from the visible world!) End your turn with enter. Clear the help text and pause with space.</p>\n<p>A tip: when you found a hive, prioritize drones so the population rises faster. However, quickly lower drone births or your population will get too large and starve in the winter!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! Contact me at\u00a0@snicklodocus\u00a0or\u00a0@nedmakesgames.
