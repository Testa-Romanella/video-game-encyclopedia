If the game starts out to slow for you, you can always fail to catch some balls on purpose to speed up the spawn rate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:36:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31f/31f2a07b581426d860df201dbb81abbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MigDev"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
