Specially hiding stuff that does not work.</p>\n<p>Believe me, there's a whole lot that is hidden on purpose.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Free 39 Portraits Pixel Art Game Assets by Free 39 Portraits Pixel Art Game Assets;</li><li>2D Pixel Dungeon Asset Pack by Pixel_Poem;</li><li>monogram by datagoblin;</li></ul>\n<p>(If I've used your assets and did not credit you, please leave a comment and I'll add you right away)</p>\n<p>The current state of the game is playable, although I'll try and clean up and add onto the game once I'm free again.</p>\n<p>I'll eventually make the code public but for now, private it is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T08:49:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d50e25d6568571c9f952274d47307cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["rhaelzo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
