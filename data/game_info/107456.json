To do that you need to collect information from the various tile types on each tile map about the location of the ladder before your turns go below 0.</p>\n<p>When you think you know where the \"ladder\" tile is hiding use the Dig button on that tile to confirm your guess. Good luck!</p>\n<p>For more detailed rules please visit the in game section of \"Game Rules\" through the Main Menu.</p>\n<p>Feel free to comment below or contact me at babis-n@windowslive.com for criticism, suggestions, questions or anything else.</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun! </p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong> : A new Windows build has been uploaded with a new marking system and improved UI buttons. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Update 2 </strong>: I have uploaded a small updated version that should fix the issues with different resolutions.
