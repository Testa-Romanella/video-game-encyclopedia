In this 2-player game, you take turns shooting each other. The last one left standing wins!</p>\n<p>The players will take turns attacking and defending. One player will be attacking, and the other one will be defending.</p>\n<p>The attacker is also able to lightly control it after firing with left&amp;right. After a determined amount of shots, the players switch roles. After a determined amount of rounds, the game ends. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/></p>\n\n<p>By random chance, a random letter will show up on screen with a red or blue color.<br/>If either player hits the key, the player with the opposite color of the key will be sabotaged.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If a player hits the space bar, then it will be destroyed and prevent the opposition from getting any help. (Essentially, hit your own color, and destroy your opposite color.)</p>\n<p>If the key was for the attacker, the defender will be\u00a0 slower for a limited time.<br/>If the key was for the defender, the attacker will be unable to control their ball.</p>\n\n<p>The players can activate a superpower with their charge meter. Once the charge is filled, the effect is activated automatically.</p>\n<p>When attacking, the charge meter can be filled if the attack hits a powerup (which is in a random position on the field) on it's way to the target.\u00a0<br/>When defending, the charge meter can be filled if the attack barely hit the defender.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The attacker's charge ability will make the next shot much faster, and the shot can be controlled better.<br/>The defender's ability will make the defender automatically dodge the next shot.</p>\n<p>Project for my Game Programming 2 Class.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T06:32:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3d/a3db4f751fb5046adfb8b20ebe5e5c2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Cammin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
