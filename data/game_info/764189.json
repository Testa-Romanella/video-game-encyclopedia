Individuals can connect their minds to others wirelessly and have created a hivemind political system where various hives live together and choose their king, queen or monarch to represent them at the congress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mikki's hive is in trouble and they decide that the best way forward for them is to form a strong alliance with another hive by marriage.</p>\n<p>Will Mikki find love and can she lead her hive out of trouble? It's up to you!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mikki</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sweet and flighty, Mikki is the type to change her mind from moment to moment with new information and her mood. Probably not the best character trait in a leader but then again, flexibility could be a strength!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Loy</strong></p>\n<p>Loy is your typical know-it-all guy, full of witty comebacks and advice, not so good with the emotional intelligence. Will that be enough to win Mikki over?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Titch</strong></p>\n<p>Titch is a vocal 'Luddite' as they are called, the rebels against the hive system who refuse to be chipped. Will you join forces with him and fight back against the hive system?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nea</strong></p>\n<p>Nea is the gentle but fair leader of the Marrow hive, where people and Earth care are paramount. She might be quite a suitable match! But does she get your heart beating?</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Demo created by Galactic Gradient 22 for\u00a0NaNoRenO 2022.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Aleya Jobson: Writer, Musician\u00a0&amp; Programmer</li><li>Pandora Alcorn: Character, Logo &amp;\u00a0UI Artist</li><li>LuckCatGood:\u00a0 Ai Backgrounds &amp; Programmer</li><li>Dani (lajbel): Lead Programmer</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>Full version coming soon!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T04:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/ceceae036d572fcf9662592d94db0a81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pandora Alcorn", "Dani Bel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
