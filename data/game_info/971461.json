This mode lets you enter a series of characters, words, or sentences you would like to brush up on or learn. These characters can be presented in a random order to sure up your knowledge of translations you struggle to remember. You can also put in words, sentences, or phrases that you already know or are interested in learning.<h3>Time Trials</h3>The time trials let you show off your skills. Offering no help/cheats if you get stuck, they are purely about speed. The shortest times from the trials are displayed on a global leaderboard in the submarine, so go get your name out there!<h3>The Sub</h3>Be sure to explore the submarine for hidden features/interactions.
