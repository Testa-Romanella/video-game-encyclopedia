Like Slimes, I'm planning on making a free version of the game with a commercial version with additional things. For the most part, players will still be getting what they'd want from the free versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why are the quests vague?</strong><br/>A: To frustrate people.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T06:23:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fed/fedf07257d6c03dfa9f86a52be78aacd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scitydreamer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
