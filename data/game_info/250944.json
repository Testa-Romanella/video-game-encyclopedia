Every sequence has 9 words. The first and last ones are fixed. The other 7 are in a random order. The player has to change the order creating links between the words. In the correct sequence, each word forms a pair with another, i.e. the first word is linked to the second, the second to the third, etc.<br/><br/>The links between words may be logical or contextual. Here are some examples:<br/><br/>\u2018Rose\u2019 is linked to \u2018Bed\u2019, as in a \u2018bed of roses\u2019.<br/>\u2018Air\u2019 is linked to \u2018Port\u2019, as in \u2018airport\u2019.<br/>\u2018Bird\u2019 is lined to \u2018Stone\u2019 as in the expression \u2018kill two birds with one stone\u2019.<br/>\u2018Page\u2019 is linked to \u2018Paper\u2019 because a page can be made of paper.<br/>\u2018Romeo\u2019 is linked to \u2018Juliet\u2019 because of the famous play.<br/>\u2018Good\u2019 is linked to \u2018Nothing\u2019 as in the expression \u2018good for nothing\u2019.<br/>\u2018Paris\u2019 is linked to \u2018France\u2019 because of its geographical association.<br/>\u2018Love\u2019 is linked to \u2018Hate\u2019 because they are opposites.<br/>\u2018Wonderful\u2019 is linked to \u2018Fantastic\u2019 because they are synonyms.<br/>\u2018Hammer\u2019 is linked to \u2018Nail\u2019 because of their logical use together.<br/><br/>Good luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/5690bd71eaa12408f67d5dd1b8463155_cJHEAZ1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Arcastudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Arcastudio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
