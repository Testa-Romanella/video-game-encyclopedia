This continues until you gain control of it (by pressing Q or E to switch between timelines.) throwing yourself into the current timeline. You use this to throw yourself in between times to put yourself behind walls that weren't there in the past or move a box to a place where you can reach it to get through the level. You may be scattered across all of these times but you are under a hive mind containing multiple versions of yourself all joined together by you.</p>\n<p>This will be updated later on.</p>\n<p>Coding: Stekapinko\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours and is on the GMTK game jam 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:00:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cac/cac01a770b9bd51b5fc69c5495c54029.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stekapinko"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
