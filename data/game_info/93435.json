They can sing better, dance better, and entertain better than any human could ever hope to, and their devotion to their jobs is unfailing.<br/><br/>The protagonist, Hana, is a young high school student who loves virtual idols - particularly Aiko. Aiko is the postergirl of the famous company Lyriq, and one of the most popular virtual idols to ever exist. Aiko is the nation\u2019s darling, and though Hana adores her, she knows she\u2019ll never get a chance to speak to her. Aiko is simply too far out of her reach.<br/><br/>That is, until one day, when somebody claiming to be Aiko starts sending Hana text messages asking for help. Aiko tells Hana that she\u2019s in severe danger of malfunctioning, and the only person who can save her is her original programmer\u2026 but nobody seems to know where they are, and nobody is willing to help her.<br/><br/>Left with no alternatives, it\u2019s up to Hana (and an eclectic cast of characters she meets along the way) to save Aiko from being turned into scrap metal!<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>A sweet, family-friendly story about making friends, going on adventures, and the power of music!</li><li>Written by ebi-hime, the author of\u00a0Strawberry Vinegar\u00a0and\u00a0Blackberry Honey</li><li>A large cast of adorable characters drawn by Melowbee, the artist behind\u00a0Windswept Night</li><li>A custom soundtrack by Mock Off, featuring an insert song by Vocaloid composer nostraightanswer (Kenji-B)</li><li>Numerous choices, branching endings, and character-specific epilogues to obtain</li><li>In-game music and CG gallery</li><li>Lots of cute girls (and some cute boys)!!!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a67/a672d5b3b9a95d0bb6bdb11a8761d886.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 343, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ebi-hime"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
