With sprites and animation for 3 new mobs for the upcoming\u00a0second level. Also got a leaderboard going but its still in working progress as I\u00a0would like a bit more in-depth and at the end I would want a boss for each level, the difficulty is always changing trying to make it feel fun and challenging. Right now my goal is to get a lot of the bugs done before I move on the second level\u00a0especially bugs that are not on my end that are harder to recreate so all can enjoy my game.</p>\n<p>A little about me, I'm a solo game dev with a passion for making games located in canada. This is my first game that I'll be uploading to the internet with that said I have made couple other projects but they never lifted off, as I've mainly stuck with programming and my biggest setback are the models, sprites and animation. \u00a0With this game I have made all the sprites and animation the only thing I\u00a0can't claim that I made is the music and the sound as that was getting overly ambitious for me maybe down the line I'll revisit it but as of now there's no plan for that.\u00a0\u00a0Currently I've been between\u00a0\u00a0job as I went to school for Culinary management got my associate's degree and my hobbies are mainly programming and motor bikes :D other then that I don't have any huge ambitious in life.</p>\n<p>Secret Hint*: brick + 5 = Unlocks all\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\r\nContent\r\n<p><strong>Current:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>1 Level</li><li>1 Endless Level</li><li>3 Playable characters</li><li>3 Mobs</li><li>1 Boss</li><li>\u00a0Difficulty bar (Hard, Suicide, Hell)\u00a0</li><li>Leader Board</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Planned:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>3 Levels</li><li>3 Endless Levels</li><li>6-9 Playable Characters</li><li>~9 Mobs</li><li>3 Bosses</li><li>More In-depth leader board</li></ul>\n\n<p>Got a trello page going if you want to see what I got planned or what I\u00a0have been doing.</p>\n<p>https://trello.com/b/GWvF3h3k/how-far<br/></p>\n<p>If you want to talk to me or just say hello,\u00a0I also got a discord.</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/Q5rCzrd</p>\n\r\nControls - Keyboard\r\n\r\n<ul><li>'W' , 'S' , 'A'\u00a0and 'D'\u00a0Keys - Movement (Up, Down, Left, Right)</li><li>'Left Shift' or 'Space Bar'\u00a0Key - Sprint (Hold)</li><li>'Left Click' - Primary fire</li><li>'Right Click'\u00a0 - Secondary fire</li><li>'R' - Reload</li><li>Escape - Pause\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T07:59:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b6/1b6acce5cad0e45eea0afb9d7f6dc2d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Highsidejr"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
