Something is waiting for you in the darkness.<br/>This is not Minecraft! This is a classic Rogue-like RPG. You must survive in the dungeon that is procedurally generated every time you enter.<br/><br/>Choose a class among many different classes and enter an unpredictable dungeon. Slain monsters, find treasure chests and get items and skills that will make you stronger. But don&amp;#39;t forget to eat. It is a bit strange but there are stores inside the dungeons. So it would be wise for you to collect gold and loots. <br/><br/>Since this is a classic style game, there are a lot of things you need to manage. But you don&amp;#39;t need to micro anything. It&amp;#39;s a turn-based game! The game will wait you to make a well thought-out move.<br/><br/>Welcome!
