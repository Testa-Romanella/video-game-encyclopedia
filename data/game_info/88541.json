Good Time Managment Game. I bought the bone making machine and if you give the dogs a bone it gives them a heart. So before I brought the dog to the cash register I would make sure the dog had five hearts. If you do that you will get a gold star and a expert rating. I will be buying this game for sure!!!\" ~ i24unicorn<br/><br/>\"But this game looks excellent, and the added 'dog show' element is cuter than heck. I can't wait to see how the game 'expands' but I definately love that you 'scroll' to see all the levels (instead of seeing only 10 levels)\" ~ Jeanie<br/><br/>\"I like this game it is cute and funny.\" ~ June129<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION:<br/>Compete in local dog shows and word of your legendary styling skills will take you to the biggest competitions around!
