Regardless, I hope you enjoy!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>\n<p>You are a weak knight, not even able to defeat a single enemy in combat. However, you have a secret; you are a werewolf. In your wolf form, you are bigger, tougher, faster, and stronger. However, you have no control over yourself in wolf form, merely attacking the nearest enemies until your bloodlust is quenched.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - Arrow keys</li><li>Jump - Up or space</li><li>Transform into werewolf - Shift (<em>get it.. cuz you're\u00a0<strong>shifting</strong> into wolf form :p</em>)</li><li>When in wolf form, you are immune to spikes and will defeat enemies. However,\u00a0you simply move towards the nearest enemy in range, even if this leads you to your death. You automatically shift back after defeating an enemy, or after 3 seconds pass.</li></ul>\n<p>Simply make your way right, past enemies and traps, to the door at the end of the room to advance to the next level (currently, there's just 2 levels. Level 3 crashed the game, so I had to remove it literally last minute). Collect hearts to gain extra lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programmed by enoua5 (@enouaauone)</p>\n<p>Tileset by Shackhal (@shackhal) [not affiliated with this project]</p>\n<p>The noticeably worse sprites by enoua5.</p>\n<p>Sound effects made in\u00a0bfxr [also not affiliated with this project]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:55:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f76/f760175ca14272cf835bae6cf662b720.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["enoua5"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
