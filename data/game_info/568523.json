The theme was \"Failure is Progress\" so I made a game of snake where you have to eat your own tail to complete a level. So failing to get the maximum score is still progress towards the higher level goal.</p>\n\n<p>I did the coding and the \"art\". all music and sound effects was from assets by these talented people:</p>\n<ul><li>nolesound: music</li><li>ObsydianX: Sfx</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing!!! Any feedback would be really apreciated!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:21:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c31df251fb1c83e3a2ed898f3bffde7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["honk-of-doom"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
