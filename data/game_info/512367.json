One for frost, one for cobwebs, one for dew... and one for mold.  When the fairy queen Titania decided that humans had lost their respect for mold, the mold fairy was sent down to teach them the power of the fuzzy fungi.  Did the fairy brighten the humans' lives, or curse them with poisons and spoiled food?  Only you can decide.\r\n<p>This is an early Flash game from Gregory Avery-Weir, released in 2009 and now available as a downloadable projector for the first time.</p>\r\nClick the world to move there.  Click and hold on the fairy to spread mold.  Use the map button to travel between locations.  When you're done spreading your spores across the town, enter the portal above to return to the land of fairy and see the results of your actions.\r\n<p><strong>If you donate at least $5, you can download full source code and resources for the game.
