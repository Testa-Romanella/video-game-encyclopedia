On the edge of the forest you can find the graveyard, where Daisy and her apprentice Ghastropod live and work.<p>A town as old as this has its fair share of ghosts, old and new. Your job, as a medium and graveyard caretaker, is to help them move on. Each ghost has their own story, traumas, and personal hauntings holding them back. This is a game about showing compassion for the dead, as well as compassion for ourselves.</p>\n<p>Demo version made in a month for Devtober, the Gentle Ghost Jam, and the Cryptid Jam. More to come soon, but I'm taking a break for November to work on another project!</p>\n<p>All comments, especially suggestions and bug reports, are extremely appreciated!
