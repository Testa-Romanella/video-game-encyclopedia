I've made a conscious effort to keep my code clean and maintainable, focusing on writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and expand.\r\n</p>\n<p>In terms of gameplay mechanics, I've explored two ways of shooting projectiles: using hitscan or simulating a real projectile. While I intentionally kept the visuals simpler to focus on coding, I believe that the gameplay mechanics are engaging and enjoyable.\r\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, I've also taken this opportunity to further my knowledge of Git and GitHub, utilizing them to manage the project.\r\n</p>\n<p>Overall, this has been a great learning experience, and I'm excited to share it with the world\r\n</p>\n<p>All the assets are CC0, but here they're anyway:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>https://kenney.nl/assets/input-prompts-pixel-16</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/free-cc0-modular-animated-vector-characters-2d<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T15:14:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f4098bd9eb9b691deb50deec2d6a4e7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlirezaF"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
