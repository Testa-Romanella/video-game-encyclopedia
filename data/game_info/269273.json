The main mechanic here is the player's lightsource, which diminishes over time. You need to collect torches to keep the flame alive, while dodging the many ghosts. In addition, you need to \"discover\"\u00a0the dungeon\u00a0exit to escape this pitiful world you've found yourself in.</p>\n<p>One can only\u00a0hope that the exit\u00a0is only\u00a0<em>lightly\u00a0</em>guarded...\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy - leave any comments on your thoughts please!</p>\n<p>This was made using the Chili Framework: http://wiki.planetchili.net/index.php... - thanks Chili!</p>\n<p>Thanks to Eric Skiff (http://ericskiff.com/music) for his amazing music!
