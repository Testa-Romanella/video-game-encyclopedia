You can run, jump and climb.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Move by using WASD and SPACE for jump, use doublejump by pressing space wile in air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We present to your attention a game with a social subtext and an allusion to the pyramid of capitalism.<br/><br/>There are no more cities in the classical sense. Thousands of people live in each building and the floors are a hierarchical pyramid, where it is almost impossible to break through from the bottom to the top.<br/><br/>Your task is to take an order in the store and make a delivery to one of the levels above. There is no place in this world for someone like you, so you will have to improvise to get to one of the upper levels.<br/>You will meet obstacles and people who inhabit this pyramid.<br/>Can you overcome all obstacles and climb to the top? Or are you dropped down where you have to start all over again? In this world, you can be both <strong>above and below...</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>In a world where money rules, everyone has their own path. Someone easily builds his life bypassing the career ladder and climbing the social lift. Someone makes his way upstairs with pain and gain, but still succeeds. And someone's life is more like a roller coaster with constant ups and downs.<br/><br/>But what if you are not perceived because you do not belong to this society? You have to find out.</p>\n\n<p>Trailer and gameplay:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T07:12:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/8592d6a721c1987e40aaaae9deb79c4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shameless Pigeon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
