When letters collide, two A's become a B, two B's become\u00a0a C, and so on. Each move will add a new letter to the grid, if possible.\u00a0You win when two Y's become a Z. But the true, AlphaBrat Ninja will\u00a0press on until all squares are filled with the letter Z. Yes, it can be done.\u00a0Click the <b>restart</b> button to restart game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T06:24:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000799aafeeddedec5ba7fe05201034e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["horan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
