If you play the game it won't be very long or very hard\u00a0bc most of the time was spent\u00a0tweaking, editing, and learning\u00a0the code instead of making levels, and even then its still a very buggy mess.\u00a0this was honestly the best I could do and it isn't my favorite game I've ever made, but it came out pretty nicely though, even though it's pretty broken. I hope you guys enjoy the game</p>\n<p>also if you think the music is good go download it on Bandcamp, or don't if you don't have space on your pc(like me) is all good</p>\n<p>https://squidtimsgameost.bandcamp.com/releases<br/></p>\n<p>thank you to cozmos for helping out and doing the sprite work, looks really cool my dude.\u00a0</p>\r\nvery cool\r\n<p>Also, go sub to him\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEBA_ADy3fEDoVZJwrnFbrQ\r\n</p>\n<p>also if you want to sub to me that's cool as well but you prob shouldn't lol<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsplGTEMGVGBl0LMaVC6trg/featured<br/></p>\n<p>(and yes, I am aware there's a game called ghost runner, I just made this name up on the fly it's not really official)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T12:05:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30d05f120000098959bb2fba727b5408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquidTim"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
