(note: I\u00a0only just saw that it was supposed to be a hyper casual game but it's a bit too late to change it now so this will do.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Forgot to add a way to exit the game so use Alt + F4 to close the game down.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT:\u00a0Found a few\u00a0bugs with the game after building it:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) If you get a game over you will need to reload the game as you will be stuck in a loop which will keep sending you back to the game over screen, so just use Alt + F4 to exit.</p>\n<p>2) When the work complete metre is full the \"win\" screen wont show up so you should just hit ALT F4 after reaching the max.\u00a0</p><p>3) Although not a bug, I forgot to set up the UI\u00a0so that I\u00a0fits to the screen size, but it should still be visible.</p>\n<p>As a note, I have briefly looked over my code and parts pf the game and have found out what is causing these issues but need to getting on with some other work I\u00a0have to do, so sorry I could upload a completely bugless game, and next time I\u00a0do anything like this I\u00a0will be sure to playtest the game a lot more, if you find any other bugs please comment them, it will be appreciated.</p>\n<p>The controls and a brief how to play description are shown in game, since I\u00a0haven't explained how to stop each of the 3 monsters in the game a brief description of each will be provided below, but if you wish to find out how to counter each of them on your own that is your choice.(note, only one monster can appear at a time)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Monster 1:</p>\n<p>This monster reacts to sound so you will need to stop typing until it leaves, you can tell it is present when you hear foot steps, but if miss the sound you can turn around and a shadow will be present by the window if it is there.</p>\n<p>Monster 2:</p>\n<p>This monster will occasionally open the door behind you, you will need to simple turn around to scare it off.</p>\n<p>Monster 3\u00a0</p>\n<p>This monster's presence is indicated by breathing, during this time do not turn around until the breathing stops.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18c/18c34d2a6d7d4240efe6195b2d1b393f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["conradschroder"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
