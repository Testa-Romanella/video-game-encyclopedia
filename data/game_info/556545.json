It was created as a bit of an outlet, an homage to games that have been a great escape, and a journal to record some of the events that we're living through. If you're currently struggling, it is probably best to skip this game.</p>\n<p>In the Thick of It was started for Global Game Jam, but due to the team's involvement in organizing the event we were not able to finish it until the following weekend. It is a game jam+ game.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Dylan Gedig,</p>\n<p>Sienna Blumstengel,</p>\n<p>Adam Caflisch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:08:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d981c1c9c7678ec9df4fb6e45bb8534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gedig"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
