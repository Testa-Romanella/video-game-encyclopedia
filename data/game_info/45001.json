As a cyborg programmed to eradicate the last remains of humanity, your sole purpose is to well... annihilate anything that moves. \n<br/><br/>\nSo grab your weapon of choice (from chainsaw, through shotgun, to grenade launcher) and kill your way through underground hideouts, post-apocalyptic cities, jungles and more. And if you're feeling creative, there are plenty other ways of ending your enemies' misery - hooks, lava pits, saws... no death will ever be the same. \n<br/><br/>\nIf kicking corpses into a lava pit and adorning walls with blood is your idea of a good time, BUTCHER is THE game for you.Ultra-violent uncompromising carnage in the spirit of Doom and Quake (chainsaw included) \nSkill-based gameplay mechanics \nRelease your inner artist, paint the walls with (permanent) blood (up to 4 million pixels available to be painted per level) \nUse the environment (saws, hooks, lava pits, animals and other) to brutally dispose of your enemies \nChoose from an array of weapons (featuring classics like chainsaw, railgun and the deadly grenade launcher) \nAdorn more than 20 levels with the insides of your enemies \nSoak in the dark atmosphere reinforced by a wicked, heavy soundtrack (while you kick corpses around) \nDie painfully: melt in lava, become piranha food, get crushed by heavy doors... and more!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-06T16:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8d/e8dae4116b287ef4ac1adb3004140f31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.67, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 93, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 416, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Transhuman Design"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Transhuman Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
