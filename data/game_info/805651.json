Why not relieve that experience in this Undertale inspired bullet hell game? Survive your co-workers conversation and unlock keys to connect with them.</p>\n\n<p>This was created for the Lost Relics 2022 Game Jam.</p>\n<p>There are many features I wanted to add, such as more dialogue, animations, more battles but ran out of time. I only had about 4 days to make this and I'm pretty happy with it. I spend most of the time building a system to create multiple types of projectiles and movement patterns. Some attacks use normal physics, some are on a fix path ,and some target directly to you. There's were a lot I wanted to add but scraped due to time constrains. It is currently 5 in the morning and the Jam ends if 4 hours. This was my second Gam Jam and it was a lot of fun. I really wanted to make an Undertale like game and the theme of Connection sounded perfect for that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T17:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75a/75aa14225d7879838d9cb0cdf252d09f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jon319p"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
