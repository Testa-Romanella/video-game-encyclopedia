At its conception, it tries to address the need to\u00a0create impromptu content from in-class exposition.</em>\r\nBLOCK-BOARD is a piece of software that allows the displaying of information attached to shapes in a 3D environment.\r\nHERE'S A DEMONSTRATION VIDEO: \r\n\r\nSome more screenshots:\r\n\r\n The user can MOVE, COLOR,SPLIT &amp; CATEGORIZE the information as needed:\r\n  \r\n<br/>\r\n By using the CAT button in conjunction with the PRINT button, the user is able to generate an arbitrary string representation of the board.\r\n \r\n<br/>\r\nPasting it into a powerful text editor like LibreOffice Writer, a teacher or student may generate any kind of activity they see fit for the content presented:\u00a0\r\n<br/>\r\n The current default printed arbitrary string is a color categorization activity:\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs of now, the project is particularly  suitable for  teachers or learners  interested in learning basic coding by building something they can use in their own practice right away.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nModifying the code-base's Printer program is a suitable task as any for beginners.\r\nIf you\u2019d like to know more check the repository at: https://github.com/wierdest/blockboard", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T12:54:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/345/3453b617b4d15459717775ede129951f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux"], "developers": ["wierdest"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
