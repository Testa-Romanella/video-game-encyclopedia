Quickly drop them off the assembly line, so as not to lose!<br/><br/>Crushed Delivery is an exciting arcade game with soft-body physics. Mail boxes crumple and break when they fall, just like in real life! Each box is equipped with a timer, and if you do not throw it in time - the game will end. The longer the match goes, the faster the new boxes are falling, it becomes harder to play! A box stuck? Throw it on the other and most likely you will cope with the situation!<br/><br/>We added a few pacifying music tracks in Crushed Delivery, so that the game was not so tense. Train your skills, increase record levels, enjoy the physics of soft bodies, crumple and destroy all the parcels!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/141/1410bfa6cca5d26d92a44adaa469d2f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nikolai Zyulin"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Nikolai Zyulin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
