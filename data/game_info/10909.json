We appreciate any feedback you can share with us, so we can tailor the next steps development to be in-line with your needs and ideas.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMore about this release<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis Early Access release empowers non-professional HTC Vive users to release their creativity and make their very own, colorful virtual 3D models. The joint forces of Leopoly engine and HTC Vive simplifies the modeling process by enabling you to create in a fun and intuitive way. This game changing virtual experience provides a natural environment for creation in the real world just as traditional sculpting and object formation is done. We believe that creation in a VR environment is more intuitive, a lot more fun and engaging and allow people to tap into creativity they\u2019ve never used.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUsers can sculpt, paint and play effortlessly while turning their imagination into reality! So start with a predesigned 3D model template or start from scratch to build anything!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can store your creations and continue your work any time. All designs can be saved in STL or OBJ file format for easy 3D printing. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022\tStart from scratch (by choosing the sphere)<br/>\r\n\u2022\tPre-designed 3D model templates<br/>\r\n\u2022\t7 sculpting tools and growing<br/>\r\n\u2022\tLimitless painting<br/>\r\n\u2022\tOpen and save 3D models<br/>\r\n\u2022\t3D print your designs<br/>\r\n\u2022\tShare with your friends<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat\u2019s next?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe will add more powerful design tools, support more VR headsets, and turn the entire application into a social, shared virtual reality experience.
