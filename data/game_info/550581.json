Well, as the entity in charge of the \"Loot and Found\" point, you have to return the abandoned items back to their rightful owners. Make sure to give them back exactly what they want, and make a pretty penny while you're at it to improve your services.</p>\n<p>But be careful! Should you return the wrong items to the wrong owners, adventures will soon grow frustrated, and will find some other dungeon to raid. Or where to die.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow keys or WASD to move, space to interact. <br/></p><p>If the embeded game doesn't work, you can download below!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Art by Ming Rang Bai &amp; Curzio Ferrara</p>\n<p>Sound Design by Andrew Hind</p>\n<p>Programming by Viki Johnson &amp; Mokhirbek Salimboev</p>\n<p><strong>Global Game Jam Link</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/wardrobe-keeper-4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:19:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45bdb0dea66d6f9459d638b592e50c27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Viki"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
