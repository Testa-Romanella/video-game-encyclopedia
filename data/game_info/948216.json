Magic has been unleashed again, changing the face of society completely. Nothing is the same anymore. Adventure is calling, and a group of would-be heroes should really heed the call because some egomaniacs are going to take over the new world for themselves.</p>\n<p>Made with RPGMV for the Project Default jam, which had an \"adventure\" theme and limited me to the premade assets. I primarily employed the default fantasy stuff, but used some of the \"SF\" assets and generator characters as well.</p>\n<p>The generous time limit allowed me to make a full-fledged RPG (JRPG-style, not exactly long, but still) this time, although I still had to compromise by keeping more of the preset data than I would have in a major project. The game lacks  polish in places \u2013 I went without item shops, and towns are blatantly unfinished \u2013, but everything semi-important made it in. But don't expect anything original in terms of gameplay \u2013 it's about telling an off-the-wall story with my usual quirky humor (and some of my newfound cynicism).<br/></p>\n<p>Incorporates scripts by Mr. Trivel, Dev_With_Coffee and Ellye.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T07:13:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39d1d97baedca4b3f620a28d8bc77c43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corlagon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
