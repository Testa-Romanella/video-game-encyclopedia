If you don't understand, it's okay. Many things in our lives are hard to understand from quantum mechanics to even how the human mind works, but it doesn't mean that you shouldn't push onwards. The challenges in our lives make us better people. We must learn to embrace those hardships and understand how to overcome them. It is then and only then when we can feel as though we have learnt from our mistakes. We must also try not to make mistakes. Although failure is a stepping stone to improvement, we must strive to not have these failures. Let me give you an analogy. Say you must cross a creek. There are two ways. Step across the smaller rocks and risk falling in and getting your shoes wet. The second option is to go across two much larger and sturdier rocks. To me personally, I would take the two larger rocks. Just like the stepping stone, try to take the shorter route. Many think of it as though you are taking the shorter route, but really there is still a chance for mistakes. The truth is that by taking the two larger rocks you are lowering the probability of making mistakes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Author's notes: If you have read this far, I would suggest that you download the game, then come back here to read the description.

Now we will be talking about how to form habits.\u00a0 Let's start off with the definition of a habit. Quote Dress; clothe. Unquote. Habit was an Archaic verb. The origins of this word was from the Latin word Habere meaning to have or consist of. It then became habitus also latin meaning condition or appearance. This then evolved into abit, an Old French word. Abit then evolved into habit the word we know today. Notes from T4YE:if you have made it this far - A. I congratulate you. This essay was not for the faint of hearted. B. I hope you go download the game. C. I might not be the greatest Game Dev, but I can write an essay.
