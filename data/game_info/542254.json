He was a toad that lived outside my house. Twinky is a powerful wizard whose experiment goes wrong. All the magic orbs used in his experiment spread across the kingdom and turned inanimate objects into monsters. In between every level, there is a storybook cutscene.\u00a0 There are four levels and this game is kid-friendly! This game was made in a class I took while in college but I thought it was good enough to post!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T06:33:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b5/7b5269112a9ab2630b75a0dd8d2e8906.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["nextjen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
