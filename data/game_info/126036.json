In this game there is nothing superfluous, the main thing is the gameplay and quickly start playing. The game is irresistible, the farther you go, the harder it will be to play it. The game process is built on the physics of gravity, the further you advance, the heavier the ball, and the platform is smaller and more crooked.</p>\n<p>The visual and musical design of the game is the style of the 80's and 90's. Control in the game is simple, but it is unique and has not been seen in other games. The idea of this game was born long ago and was inspired by the games Flappy Bird and Smash Hit.</p>\n<p>The game is well optimized and has been tested for performance on very weak devices.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2adfb341e2442a76803c48b29f30a8b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["NICHOLAS VESELOV"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
