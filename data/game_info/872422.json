For which a war began between gods, ogres and humans.</p>\n<p>Five of the gods, seeing the corrupt power of one of them, decided to ally themselves and thus end the corrupt god and ogres, but when making that unification their power was fragmented and thus the 6 fragments were created.</p>\n<p>The fragments are: Dark, Death, Life, Love, Wealth and Power.</p>\n<p>Each of these fragments have a special power.
