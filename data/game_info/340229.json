{"id": 340229, "slug": "man-hunt", "name": "Man Hunt", "name_original": "Man Hunt", "description": "<p>*Disclaimer: This game contains offensive and potentially triggering language/content.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Embreate\u2019s \u201cMan Hunt\u201d was created in the vein of the classic 80s arcade game \u2018Duck Hunt\u2019. Players can shoot rainbows by clicking with the left button on the mouse\u00a0to trigger rainbow lasers that penetrate antagonistic characters (recognizable anti-LGBTQ figures) on screen. When the laser hits the characters they transform into unicorns. The game will also feature a score of how many targets each person has successfully hit per session.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The city of Toronto is often defined by its multiculturalism, where diversity and inclusivity is pronounced. At its core, Embreate's \u201cMan Hunt\u201d encourages the positive message of diversity and equal rights for all. However, we also want to acknowledge many of the prominent figures that have spoken in ignorance or in opposition to LGBTQ+ rights throughout history. Players spread positivity by shooting rainbows using/from their hands toward various antagonistic figures on a screen. Antagonists will transform into mythical creatures if they are hit with a rainbow laser.</p>\n<p>The intention is for audiences to use positivity and light to transform hate into love. This is meant to cogitate the current discourse of certain LGBTQ+ issues, where people choose to ignore or do nothing despite now being given the option to make a difference. There are many prominent figures who are outspoken about their anti-queer views, but rather than just answer with violence or hate, we advocate for love and inclusivity. This becomes a means to demonstrate that together we can overtake any obstacles. This shall allow everybody to unite and spread love to the world.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><strong>Producer:\u00a0</strong>Scott Nihill</p><p><strong>Director:\u00a0</strong>Lalaine Ulit-Destajo</p><p><strong>Programmer:</strong> Jeffrey Barkun</p><p><strong>Artist:</strong> Arantxa Chavarri</p><p><strong>Artist:</strong> Halie Towns\u00a0</p><p><strong>Artist:</strong> Karl Liu</p><p><strong>Artist:</strong> Luke Dickey</p><p><strong>Artist:</strong> Sandra Krutow</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T03:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df26321f9b5e7e29092d899c1f02ecec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Embreate"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
