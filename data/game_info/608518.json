So this scene may help to understand some of the basic rules of roleplaying tabletop games.<br/><br/>If you are a lonely adventurer that standing on a crossroad with grey, boring and empty life on one way and creative, unbelievable and full of discoveries life of a roleplayer in another hand - i hope Last Blossom will help you to choose the right road.<br/>And if you will not be quite inspired about all of this - just be sure that real roleplaying games with the right people are way better, so please don't give up!<br/><br/>I tried to put in this scene more or less full tutorial and\u00a0<strong>detailed \"Help\"</strong>\u00a0section, so if you are a beginner in this kind of genre, or maybe you not quite often playing in videogames at all - you still have a chance to figure out how it works.<br/>If you will have some trouble in understanding of what's happening in the game, or what you need to do - i would be grateful if you let me know about you're problem.<br/><br/>OGL notice:<br/>This game contains some of the Open Game Content that used under and in terms of Open Gaming License Version 1.0a.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T08:53:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fa/9fad6a01618122cc09a1e51a8a283fe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Renardon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
