Nowadays, they've fallen out of grace, and little is to be seen of them in the big screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turns out, their incredible ability lets them change industries rather easy. In this game, you accompany Kawaii Kaiju Clan, a group of seasoned Kaiju musicians ready to rock the stages of Nara, Japan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play the guitar and achieve perfect scores in this (definitely not Guitar Hero inspired) game! and then try it again. And again. Watch Godzilla as it passes judgement upon your performance, and enjoy the classic tune.<br/></p><p>Note: Credits weren't working in the uploaded build, so we updated the version to include the credits!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T08:43:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d5657f418fde8b04c6a93b2734043e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["soundgarden134", "joaquin.gutierrez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
