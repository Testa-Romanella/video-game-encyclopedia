I'm hoping what little there is sets a nostalgic/chill mood at least.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately it needs another day or two in the oven. I'm looking forward to writing about the week on my website. In short:\u00a0I spent way too long on menu stuff this week and trying to figure out Pixel Perfect Camera with varying DPIs.</p>\n<p>I intend to complete it to the vision I\u00a0had in mind and I'll open up the comments when that time comes. While this is late for my own \"game a week\" effort, it's not actually late for the game jam it's intended for nor will it be.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your patience and support \ud83d\ude42</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T04:52:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cb/1cbcc6eb71a8a2c2d51a3dd773ed2a99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stephen Pearce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
