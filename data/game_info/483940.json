I knew I had to make something because the jam was such a neat idea, but I was starting late off the back of LOWREZJAM. The game is quite unpolished, mashes different art styles, is barren of music and lacks the goofy charm of WarioWare, but\u00a0I finished in time for submission and I'm happy. Don't accept my excuses! But\u00a0I did want\u00a0to\u00a0acknowledge some asset use, such as the\u00a0arcade cabinet model featured in the transition, originating from TV Show King 2, I wanted to replace this and will do post-jam. I'm also using some stock sounds and other purchased assets. Fonts used were made by somepx and some textures were made by Kronbits. I'm probably gonna get some sleep now.</p>\n<p><strong>------------ THANKS FOR PLAYING\u00a0 ------------</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:01:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72b/72b4cda82f9067bd9a9d7cafb253a954.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Joseph Ferrari"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
