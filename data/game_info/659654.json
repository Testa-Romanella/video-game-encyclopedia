With the white arrows on the left and right side of the screen you can rotate the whole selected ring by 60 degrees to either side.</p>\n<p>Summon Heros:</p>\n<p>Click / Tap on the castle in the middle and choose a type to summon from the menu above the castle. To cancel just click anywhere else.</p>\n<p>After choosing a type to summon place it on a hextile. To cancel Click / Tap the castle again.</p>\n<p>Placing the hero:</p>\n<p>Windows / WebGL : right click on the hextile you want to place the hero on.</p>\n<p>Android: tap and hold the hextile you want to place the hero on.</p>\n<p>Menu:</p>\n<p>Start Game, starts a new game.

The red hextile next to an enemy shows where it will move next. Place heroes on the map to fight the enemies. If there is a hero on an adjacent hextile next to an enemy, the enemy will not move between turns and instead fight the hero. Multiple heroes/enemies can fight with each other. If an enemy reaches the castle in the middle and there is no hero next to the enemy, the enemy will attack the castle. The game ends when the castle lost all of its 6 hitpoints. After placing your heroes and rotating the map, Click / Tap end turn to continue.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:51:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2f/e2f8d3a5e8cdfc8ee443654d538e6c34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["fortytwoboxes"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
