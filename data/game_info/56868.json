{"id": 56868, "slug": "under-fire", "name": "Under Fire!", "name_original": "Under Fire!", "description": "<p>Under Fire! is a tactical level computer game released by Avalon Hill's computer division in 1985. The game was released for Apple II, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS systems. Initial packaging had the name of the designer, Ralph H. Bosson, over the title on the box front so as to read Ralph Bosson's UNDER FIRE!, but subsequent packaging replaced his name and read Avalon Hill's UNDER FIRE! instead. The C64 port was by Dyadic Software Associates.</p>\n<p>The game was not billed as a computer version of Squad Leader, though it did bear some similarities in that players commanded roughly company sized forces. Only three maps were available for play. The game was unique in that for each of the nine scenarios, victory was not declared at game's end. A results screen would show losses in men and equipment, and list possession of objectives, leaving the determination of \"victory\" to the player.</p>\n<p>An Extended Capabilities Disk was sold by Avalon Hill also, adding 56 more US, German and Russian assault guns and tanks to the game, as well as providing Japanese, British and Italian forces, with two additional maps and six more scenarios. A Second Extended Capabilities Disk also underwent initial development, bringing a campaign layer to the game, increasing the speed of play, and making use of 64K of additional memory (where available).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a558fbf0619cb056a5ff220bfc25f1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II", "PC"], "developers": ["Avalon Hill"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Avalon Hill"], "esrb_rating": null}
