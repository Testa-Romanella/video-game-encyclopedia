We hope you enjoy your time working here!\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>But things aren't as they seem.</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>Here at Spring And Co. , we think the location that you're working at might have been robbed.

Shine your light to see what's in it. If anything appears there, close the vent by <strong>clicking and holding down</strong>. Swipe down while facing the front to see the camera system.
