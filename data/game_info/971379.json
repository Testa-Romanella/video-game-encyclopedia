Your past is unclear, but the Light gives you strength to proceed through the darkness of void. Embrace it and try to uncover the secrets of this monochromatic world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Divinest Light is a single player experience with an emphasis on original plot and shadow-avoidance game mechanics as the character can only survive under the Light.<br/><br/>Divinest Light implements a seamless transition between the menu and gameplay to greatly increase immersion. Also, there is almost no text in Divinest Light - just a small informational hint in the main menu.
