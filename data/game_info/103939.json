But<br/>again the garden is invaded by evil and opportunist insects.<br/>Now, as before, Robbie is ready to act!<br/>Robbie has less oil in his gears nowadays, but the same<br/>decision. He has got three lethal insecticides to fight all<br/>living bugs.<br/>So, he must sprinkle each insect that comes near his flowers<br/>with the right spray. A wrong spray will get insect<br/>momentarily paralised, or they won\u2019t suffer at all. If Robbie<br/>leaves his flowers neglected, insect will eat them in<br/>seconds!<br/>Note that in level five, flowering plants will reveal<br/>Robbie\u2019s dreams!<br/>Insects\u2019 speed will increase each five levels.</p>\n<p><strong>ROBBIE STRIKES BACK!</strong><br/>Copyleft (C) 2017<br/>SalvaKantero Program, graphics, FX sound<br/>Beyker Music<br/>Masterklown Tape cover<br/>Felipe Monge Additional graphics<br/>Dany Cantero Traductions</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9d97f88bdb5df206cd0e322b9ee8c07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Playonretro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
