Returning to the picnic site, all your food is gone. There's bears in the woods and they're hungry for sandwiches.</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to navigate the woods and grab all 4 stolen items - lemonade, cheese sandwich, crisps and apple before the bears get you, stealing it all back and you have to start again. The longer you take, the more bears will arrive to pinch your food.<br/></p>\n<p>Why aren't the bears just eating it immediately? Why are the bears so fast? How could a bear drink a can of lemonade? All questions to ask whilst you race to reassemble a decent lunch.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the pico-1k 2022 jam - 1k of compressed pico-8 source code (no prebuilt graphics or sound included).</p>\n<p>Please note, as a result, this game is fairly janky. I had a lot of fun squeezing what I think is a fair amount out of the space, but some things do not work as nicely as they would with a bit more space. The depth sorting is rudimentary and glitches when you move quickly. In addition, there's the very visible fisheye effect. I'm really pleased with the trees, given the space, and happy I managed to fit sound in at all.<br/></p>\r\nCode\r\n<p>Check out the source code in this Gist or on pico-8-edu.com.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Ben Jones / Powersaurus - design, code, art and sound except item pickup sound (from Zep's pico-8 docs)<br/></p>\n<p>Built using pico-8</p>\n<p>I\u00a0used\u00a0Sean S.
