The more pickles you have, the more poglins eager to come and steal your pickles.<br/>\r\nAlso the more you click, the higher level you get which means more pickles for you to receive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLater on I will add that along with other things I have in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll and all I hope to grow this sapling of a game and grow it into something I never thought I could accomplish. That's all I have and thank you for consideration.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T17:17:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/974/974ade445985509c267c4127bb1181df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shard"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Shard"], "esrb_rating": null}
