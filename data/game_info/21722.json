The lands of Ashworld contain many places of interest - especially noteworthy are various temples, from those occupied by servants of wizards' orders which provide magic services, to ancient abandoned ruins where valuable magic items can be found. Outside the territories where humans reside other races live who may become important allies if persuaded to join the war. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Main features:</strong><br/>- an open-world environment where exploration supplements strategic planning and tactical decisions<br/>- easy management of resources<br/>- hand drawn graphics in the style of classic, golden age, illustration<br/>- designed to cater for custom scenarios/modding<br/><br/><br/><strong>Special notes</strong><br/>Legions of Ashworld is a hard game, suitable for players wanting something different with a lot of challenge.
