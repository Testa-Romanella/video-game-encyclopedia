Chapter 1 follows the quest of Def, a nobody who lives in a town full of heroes. Follow him on his journey to the Tower of Shadows, and defeat whatever lurks within it to bring peace to the Kingdom. This seemingly-generic quest should be easy, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're into games that are predictable, where absolutely nothing strange, unexpected, or slightly disturbing happens, then this is the game for you! ODD FANTASY is NOT a game that progressively becomes weirder and weirder with each installment, and it MOST CERTAINLY wasn't written with the intent of giving the player an existential crisis by the end of the series! Whoo, baby!</p>\n\n<p>So, now it's time to go ahead and play the ODD FANTASY: Chapter 1 Demo!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unless you decide not to download it, in which case you will not play the ODD FANTASY: Chapter 1 Demo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1c/f1c81ee5f34f9c78a90e3b7e498d8d4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GhostScreen Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
