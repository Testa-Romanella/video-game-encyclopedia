You've been isekai-d into a world where you are an adorable fish girl senpai!</p>\n<p>Out of Water is heavily inspired by the early 3D Sonic games, and was designed around the theme of \"Clich\u00e9\" for Game Off 22. We focused on fish based puns/idioms and aimed for a general japanese/anime aesthetic with the cartoony main character feeling out of place (OUT OF WATER?)\u00a0in the relatively grounded environment.</p>\n<p>We have fish in barrels that shoot, a harem of fish boys vying for fish girl senpai's attention, toast being held in her mouth which she runs to make it to school on time, and a bunch more clich\u00e9s for your playing pleasure... including, a definitely not Crush 40 rip-off soundtrack from the hit band Squeeze 39 (also known as, me screaming in my room with a guitar, bass and some filters)</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our silly little fish game!</p>\n\n<p>For more details and our source code, check out our repo here:\u00a0https://github.com/DanMossDev/game-off-22</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T12:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/453/453bb21951eae0be9d03a44f5498d8ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gameghoul", "Purple Puffer Productions"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
