While keyboard play technically works, we do not recommend it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What is Tale of Jade?</strong></p>\n<p>The player will need to use the abilities they gain throughout the game to overthrow the emperor and restore order to the empire.</p>\n<p>Every skill is designed to interact with the rest, allowing the player to creatively overcome the different challenges that the game offers. To use these powers, the player will have to perform specific sequences of buttons assigned to them. These sequences are designed so that, even though they may be complex at first, the player gradually gets used to them, achieving a feeling of mastery.</p>\n<p><strong>Damn, how can I support it?</strong></p>\n<p>This is just a demo, so if you want to follow the game's development, you can do it on twitter at @KEstudio_es.
