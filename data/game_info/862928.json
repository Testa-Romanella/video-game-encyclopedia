This is our first game jam!\u00a0 It was VERY hard on Kaech who didn't sleep much. Please support him with your feedback =-D</p>\n<p>I (Cypheus) hope you love the music. I just started doing music production a few months ago and would love your feedback on the soundscape. There's about 5 minutes of completely custom music in the game! We'd love if you stuck around to hear it all at least once!</p>\n<p>(This game had game-breaking bugs when we first uploaded, but we just uploaded a version that doesn't crash on Menu or Death! Yay!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T17:42:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/568/5688181b195f1ce439f55debfeb11dc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cypheus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
