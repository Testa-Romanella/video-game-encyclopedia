This is bad news for Eyan, our main character who had planned to hold a special wing night at midnight.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the amount of wings made the aliens spaceship too heavy so he had to drop them off scattering them across the land. Since they were in space air they\u2019re still floating around, but soon the space air will wear off, the wings will fall to the dirt and Eyan\u2019s Wing night will be bust. The alien dropped some space bombs to prevent Eyan from collecting the wings. These must be avoided!\r\n</p>\n<p>Eyan must collect all the wings he can to make his wing night come true.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45e/45e9daedab6299b7bed290102c3ee24a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joshlucky3000"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
