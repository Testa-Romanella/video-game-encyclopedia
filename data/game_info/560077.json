There's just one problem. <em>They won't stop coming.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>-<br/></em>This game was made to try and quell the lack of a real GWRE2 successor (atleast in my opinion).  The project is in it's very early infancy and I'm not sure on whether to continue this project or ditch it for my other main projects. If people enjoy what there is to offer so far, I might continue this project.</p><p>Please note that the tracks used in this game are not mine and all credit goes to Chris Chudley.<br/></p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Playing this game on a controller is HIGHLY recommended.<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS (Gamepad):</p>\n<p>Left Stick/Dpad - Move</p>\n<p>Right Stick - Fire</p>\n<p>Left or Right Triggers - Shoot Bomb</p>\n<p>A - Select Option<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS (Keyboard):</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Fire</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Bomb</p>\n<p>Right Shift - Select Option<br/></p>\n<p>-<br/></p>\n<p>KNOWN ISSUES:</p>\n<ul><li>Weavers (the green guys) don't actually dodge at the moment. I was trying a bunch of solutions for their dodge behavior, but all of them either broke all enemies or made them zip toward the corners of the arena.</li><li>Bombs don't hit enemies properly. In GWRE2, bombs grow in size around the arena and hit enemies who hit that hitbox. In NF, bombs are essentially a screen clear.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:43:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33e/33ecfd469a2765ead9f2853ffa200b55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kyokonull"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
