The dwarf was sent to find an ancient treasure\u00a0armed only of a pick-axe and willpower.</p>\n<p>The game puts the player in a maze-like map where the walls are made of \u201crock blocks\u201d. Some of them\u00a0can be destroyed by the main mechanic of the game: Dig.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this way, the player can choose her/his own way by freeing up pace from the map creating new paths.<br/><br/>In order to add more tension to the exploration part of the game, when\u00a0a block is destroyed, a ghost, nothing at all, or the desired ancient treasure will be spawned on the same position.</p>\n<p>We wanted to make the exploration of the mine both exciting and dangerous, and for these reasons, we added this spawning system\u00a0that balances the possible reward of the next block to be destroyed.</p>\n<p>In the future we plan to develop a multiplayer mode, more maps, and a\u00a0random items drop mechanic which will grant power-ups such as speed boosts, invisibility, crowd controls, etc, adding to the game more unpredictability that reflects the intended experience of a dangerous, mysterious, and rewarding exploration. </p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Andrea \"Harbrus\" Ortino - Game Designer and Programmer<br/>Giovanni Paolini - Game Programmer\u00a0<br/><br/>Repository link -\u00a0https://github.com/Paulfinex/GameEngCw<br/>Music Effects:<br/>Dwarf Sprite:\u00a0http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?PHPSESSID=d9afc0beb4bf760c5c641facbc3e25f9&amp;topic=169225.0<br/>Treasure:<br/>Library used: SFML, Box2D.</p>\n<p>Follow Harbrus\u00a0 on:<br/>\u25ba First\u00a0YT Channel (ITA): https://www.youtube.com/c/harbrus<br/>\u25baSecond YT\u00a0 Channel (ENG): http://tiny.cc/9kzw3y<br/>\u25baTelegram: https://t.me/harbrusgames<br/>\u25baItch.io: https://harbrus.itch.io/ <br/>\u25baKo-Fi: https://www.ko-fi.com/Harbrus (Donation and Coffee!)<br/>\u25baFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/harbrus<br/>\u25baTwitter: https://twitter.com/harbrus1<br/>\u25baInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/harbrus<br/>\u25baLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-ortino-208b97128/<br/><br/></p>\n<p>If you like this prototype, please consider donating to support us :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T06:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d0/8d02a2953063dc5a90bf585404a57d9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harbrus Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
