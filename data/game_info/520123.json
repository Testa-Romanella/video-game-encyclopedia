In this game, you and a friend choose a Cast of 9\u00a0Characters. The Characters are placed on the stage, Players alternate taking Turns,\u00a0and\u00a0after 19 urns the player with the most Characters wins!</p>\n<p>Characters in this game include Dragons, Demons, and Politicians. There are also Cats. You can have 9 Cats. Just like in real life, if you get 9 Cats in this game people will think you are crazy.</p>\n<p>There are 25 Characters to choose from. They all have different powers so find the combinations that work well together or find the combinations that make you happy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Players usually can use 5 of their Characters on each of their Turns. The exceptions are\u00a0the First Turn and the Last Turns.\u00a0 On the First Turn Player 1 can only use 3 Characters instead of the usual 5. On each Player's Last Turn they get to use all of their Characters. Near the end quantity beats quality. Use this to your advantage.<br/></p>\n<p>Anthology is still under development. This game used to include Beehives, Anthills, and Praying Mantises. They were all removed because\u00a0we squash bugs on principle. If you have an idea on how to make the game better please let us know. All feedback is appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T08:20:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e6c5381174388d882b0ae2b4f74bb21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StoryTime"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
