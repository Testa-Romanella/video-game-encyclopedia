Running into fires will deplete your health. How many fires can you put out? This is the first game I've ever made, sort of. It's the only one that has a titlescreen and some kind of gameplay. It's also for the GMTK Game Jam for 2020, so I had to make it in\u00a0 48 hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6ad95c4bcd7d027c68b50a2e008044ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AvocadoSpud"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
