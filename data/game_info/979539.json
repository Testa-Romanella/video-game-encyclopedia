In this game you have to control a character to patrol a 13th-floor apartment, look for anomalies.  If you spot any anomalies, mark a cross on the sign-in sheet on the wall and go to the next floor; if there is no anomaly, go directly to the next floor. After reaching the top (i.e. 13th floor), you win. If you fail, you will return to the first floor and start over.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay Time\uff1a15-60 minutes<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCaution: If you don't read Chinese characters at all, the game may be more difficult, as a few anomalies include changes to Chinese characters, but it's still possible to beat the level if you pay close attention.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T06:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/202/2024d5c3e30d960838712ce02f74c6a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lu"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lu"], "esrb_rating": null}
