{"id": 940352, "slug": "shootin-iron", "name": "Shootin' Iron", "name_original": "Shootin' Iron", "description": "<p>Welcome to Shootin' Iron! A game set in the old west, with a focus on gun-play.</p>\n<p>Targets magically appear over the heavily romanticised, pixelated, western landscape. The closer to the bullseye you hit, the more points you get. Targets appear and disappear more quickly as the game progresses, and they get smaller and more numerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left click to shoot.\u00a0To aim, press and hold the right mouse button. The longer you hold it, the more accurate your shot, but watch out! You can only aim for so long, your stamina will have to be carefully managed.</p>\n<p>You're armed with a six-shot revolver. Bullets must be reloaded one-by-one (press and hold the space-bar). Obviously, this takes time, and you cannot aim while loading. You'll have to keep an eye on your ammo and pick the right moment to reload.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p>What's a \"Shootin' Iron\"? It's what cowboys call their guns! ...according to Hollywood (this game is not meant to be historically accurate)</p>\n<p>This game was built off the back of an idea I had during a game jam. While learning l\u00f6ve2d, I followed a tutorial which was a simple 'circle appears, player clicks circle, new circle appears' game loop. I felt it would be fun to recreate this and add a bit of gun-play to it, and a wild west theme.</p>\n<p>It's my first completed game project, there's a ton of other features I'd love to add to it - if people enjoy the game, maybe it will get expanded. In the mean time, I thought I'd keep it small scale, so here it is!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Shootin' Iron! Comments and feedback are warmly welcomed. If you're a coder, feel free to have a look through my git repo, I'm by no means a Lua expert, so any insights you can offer into how I'd done things would also be welcomed.</p>\n<p>The repo:\u00a0https://github.com/AlexMannDesigns/Shootin-Iron<br/></p><p><strong>Credits and Thanks</strong></p><p>The code for this game was 100% written by yours truly.
