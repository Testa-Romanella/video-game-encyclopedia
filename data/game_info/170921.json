Be careful: if Odin's ravens spot you they will call him to your position.  Tyr, the only god who doesn't fear your potential, will gradually lower your threat when you spend time with him.  Eat creatures smaller than you and grow as large as you can before Odin gets his way.<br/></p><p>Created for Ludum Dare 34 and fulfilling both the categories (Growth and two button control), this game was made by a team new to game jams who are all members of George Mason University's Game Analysis and Design Interest Group (GADIG).</p><p>All scripts, art, and sound were created during this Jam.</p><p>--------- <br/>Credits <br/>---------</p><p>Programming:</p><p>Zack Laine (Lead) <br/> Jacob D.
