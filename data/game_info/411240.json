Adding water will increase the temp, ice decreases. Though be aware ice will melt adding water and therefore cooling less overall as time goes by. When ready you can press the serve drinks button to finish, or hit the discard drink to start over with a new temp. You get bonus points for how close you are to the target temp, and how full the cup is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/dedc34dc029d741c1cefa0f932aa4ba6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pixelvengeance"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
