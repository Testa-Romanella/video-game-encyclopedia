I made it  almost two years ago for a class. In this game you play as someone inside of a game's file system. Music is : Brazil performed by Django Reinhardt. As always I got help with programing from @SuspiciousCloud. Other sounds I got from a sound library (I don't know who I stole them from). </p><p>Sadly I lost the unity files so I can't make an OSX or Linux version. If I find them I will upload them. Also there is no way to exit the game so you will have to alt tab and kill the application from your desktop.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>WASD : Moving </p><p>Space  : Jumping</p><p>Shift  : Sprinting</p><p>[ You should keep the Shift key pressed the whole game... (I am sorry) ]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c94/c9442c682eb9ab892180a8a31d66cb9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rabbit"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
