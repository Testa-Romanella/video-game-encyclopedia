In the third part you as well as in the previous need to pass the levels, playing for a Viking. At each level there is a certain number of items, which will open the door to the house of the Viking, and passing through which you will find yourself on the next level. Be careful, because on your way there are even more dangerous traps, and the levels themselves have become even more difficult. But do not worry if you suddenly die, you will try again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46a/46a6b088b294fde157a8abf13ff22553.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LTrust"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LTrust"], "esrb_rating": null}
