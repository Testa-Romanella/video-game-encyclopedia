It\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work for you. As a concierge, how far will you go to make billionaires\u2019 dreams come true?<br/><br/>Platinum Package is a 500,000-word interactive contemporary drama by Emily Short, with additional content by Hannah Powell-Smith, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based\u2014without graphics or sound effects\u2014and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br/><br/>As an employee of Platinum Concierge, it\u2019s your job to find the unfindable and do the impossible for the world\u2019s wealthiest people. Charter a helicopter on fifteen minutes\u2019 notice to bypass LA rush-hour traffic? Transport a priceless emerald-and-diamond necklace across three continents? Arrange a candlelit dinner in a cave with waiters that rappel down the walls? No problem at all. You have your finger on the pulse of every brand, trend, and connection of the still-new 21st century.<br/><br/>But you also get to see the darkness behind the glitter: the excess, the waste, the callousness of the overly wealthy, the sacrifices that your colleagues make to help already-privileged people's wishes come true.<br/><br/>As your slate of clients grows, you\u2019ll need to bring every bit of professional skill that you\u2019ve got. When clients\u2019 requests take you close to the edge of legality - and sometimes, over it - will you still grant their wishes? Will you cover up your clients\u2019 misdeeds, no matter how far they go? Will you try to convince them to walk a different path? Will you join them for the ride, basking in the luxury of their lifestyle - and possibly even becoming fabulously wealthy yourself? Will you help your fellow concierges rise along with you, or will you betray and undermine them at every turn?<br/><br/>How far will you go to help your clients? How close will you get to them before your judgment starts to cloud? How high will you climb in your own quest for wealth and power?<br/><br/><ul><li>Play as male, female, or nonbinary; gay, straight, or bi.<br/></li><li>Mingle with Hollywood stars, tech moguls, art connoisseurs, and more!<br/></li><li>Plug into an international network of fellow concierges.
