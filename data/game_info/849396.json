Well, this game aims to find out! <br/><br/>Follow the story of our hero, trapped in a looping nightmare while in a comatose state. The only way to escape and wake up? You have to fight through your own grief in a single\u00a0iteration of the nightmare by building up your cognitive and emotional strength in order to best yourself in combat. <br/><br/>If your grief gets the best of you at any point, you will find yourself at the start of the loop. But don't let death stop you from becoming stronger. Let it become the thing that defeats your own inner demons, and NEVER let yourself accept the way things are.<br/><br/>This game is also almost fully mod-able, including abilities to add text cutscenes, custom battles with your own character images/music! Documentation is included in the zip file\u00a0and modding tools will be released at a later date!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T04:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3be96d2245f4d253bb5da47ec49b08f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamPaktGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
