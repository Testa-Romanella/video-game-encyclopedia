And even since this is the first game like this the team did we are pretty sattisfied, even knowing it could be better.<br/><br/>So if you like the game and you'd like to see more of these two kids don't hesitate to contact us. Who know's? Maybe their story is not finished yet.</p><p>Authors:</p><ul><li>Carlos Ad\u00e1n L\u00f3pez - Game/Level Design &amp; Programmer</li></ul><ul><li>Ang\u00e9lica Villafa\u00f1e L\u00f3pez (Angl-V) - Game/Level Design &amp; Artist</li></ul><p>Contact Info:</p><p>Carlos Ad\u00e1n L\u00f3pez: </p><ul><li>@Charlio_85 </li><li>http://dropr.com/cadanlo</li><li>malakaimakaisson5@gmail.com</li></ul><p>Ang\u00e9lica Villafa\u00f1e L\u00f3pez (Angl-V)</p><ul><li>http://anglvl.blogspot.com.es/</li><li>https://www.facebook.com/AnglVil/</li><li>anvil.cross@gmail.com</li></ul><p>Changelog:</p><p>27/2: This is the jam's release.
