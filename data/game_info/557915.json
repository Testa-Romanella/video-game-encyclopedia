If I had the time :D</p>\n<p>The game I wanted to make was inspired by Minit, in which the player has a certain amount of time to explore the world, solve puzzles, etc. before being reset to their spawn point.</p>\n<p>I got as far as the puzzles! Very frustrating, but a good lesson in project scale!</p>\n<p>The mechanics of the game follow in a similar vein, revolving, however, around \"Soul Shards\". The player begins with 3 shards, allowing them to explore the environment for a given duration. When this duration expires, the player is warped back to the spawn, leaving a shard behind! If a player recollects a shard, the timer resets, encouraging exploration and strategy! Running out of shards, however, will result in a game over! All of which was implemented!</p>\n<p>Most of the time this jam was spent on backend systems: building a custom dialogue system, procedural player animator and the soul/respawn mechanic.</p>\n<p>In either case, I hope you enjoy the aesthetic of the game! I look forward to playing the others!\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>W, A, S, D - Move</p>\n<p>Space - Interact</p>\n<p>X - Reset</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T04:09:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1d7e4a7cd95de575b003097dd3274cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Callum Else"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
