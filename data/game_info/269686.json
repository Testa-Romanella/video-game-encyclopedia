As any other successful game, millions of Solitaire clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with many card layouts in a tiny download package. <br/><br/>The game starts with a specific layout and one open card. Rest of the cards are on closed stack. Your aim is to move all the cards to open card. <br/><br/>- You can move any of the open card on the three peaks to the open card if it is adjacent to it regardless of the suit. e.g. you can move a 3 or 5 in case the open card is 4. Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). <br/>- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. <br/>- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points. These points start with 1 for the first time and increase by 1 for subsequent cards. However if you open a close card the streak breaks and the point start from 1 again. <br/>- So every time you are possible to earn highest score if you want. <br/><br/>if you\u2019re enjoying TriPeaks Solitaire, please take a few seconds to give us a review!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e1/4e1945f9b003c14b9946ec51c33be434_D1az2VW.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["an zhuona"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["an zhuona"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
