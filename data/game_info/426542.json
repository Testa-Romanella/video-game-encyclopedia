Note that this is just a prototype (not even a demo)\u00a0 of the game.\u00a0 Development is ongoing and lots of features, contents, and story lines shall be added.</p>\n<p>The game title is yet to be defined, the plot, name of the character, the enemies, etc... I would like to make a game with a protagonist that has\u00a0a\u00a0story worth playing for.... A solid story line that would drive players to discover and play more.\u00a0A horror that resonates the silent hill experience and\u00a0make players swallow their own saliva by just hearing the background music.</p>\n<p>I'm a solo developer with a great vision for this project, and I would like to ask for your support to make all these things possible. Your suggestions are highly appreciated as this game will be for all of us. If you would like to support the development of the game, you can express it by being a Patreon. I'll be posting devlogs on my patreon page and update you guys from time to time, not mentioning the benefits you will get from being a true supporter.</p>\n<p>Be a supporter:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/solodevinteractive<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>W / Up Arrow - Move forward</li><li>S / Back Arrow - Move backward</li><li>A / Left Arrow - Rotate player left</li><li>D / RIght Arrow - Rotate player right</li><li>Shift - Run</li><li>E - Interact</li><li>X / Esc - Cancel</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T03:53:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f921ed7c7872c1668fcab6964fd4ce81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["flixbeat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
