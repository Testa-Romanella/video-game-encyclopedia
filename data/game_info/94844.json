O humiliation! O shame! <br/></p>\n<p>The entire solar system (accursed Earthlings!) is laughing at you, or so you feel--nay, know, in your sad planetoidary mind. <br/><br/>What will become of you, Pluto? Where will you go? <br/><br/><br/>WHAT TO DO: <br/><br/>Slingshot yourself out of orbit and out into deep space. <br/><br/>Absorb the energies of space junk such as space potatoes, astrocats, the Hubble Space Telescope and both Voyager missions! <br/><br/>Avoid energy-draining waste fired by a legion of strange toupee-headed robots that seem to be polluting the universe with negative energy. <br/><br/>The solar system mocks you. <br/><br/>Take it. It's yours. <br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS: <br/></p>\n<p>Left-click+drag with mouse to operate the space slingshot <br/>(Pull back the directional circle in the opposite direction that you want to go! Sounds about ten times more complicated than it is.) <br/><br/>Works even better on a touchscreen, if you have one! Just pull and release. <br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID SO FAR:</p>\n<p>'Cool. I destroyed our solar system with no particular motivation :) Good job. :)'</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS: <br/><br/>TK <br/>bluetriangle <br/>danheff <br/>goldsheep <br/><br/><br/>Awesome music by danheff available on soundcloud: (https://soundcloud.com/danheff/plutos-tear-final-v...) <br/><br/>Thanks for playing! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/570/570958acd4b1b7652ce61d856d68d755.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Kestrel Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
