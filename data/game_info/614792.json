It will receive updates and stuff. Graphics are terrible so don't mind abt them(im not a good about designing graphics). If there is someone that want's to help to code this project then send a message or comment. And also the game is on Finnish language so here is some terminology: Pelaa\u00a0= play, Kauppa\u00a0= shop, Osta\u00a0= buy, Lopeta\u00a0= quit, Raha = coin, Rahat\u00a0= coins and, Myyty\u00a0= sold. I will update ability to change the language to English at somewhere but now i don't have the time to do that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0email: dylancamporotondo@gmail.com\u00a0</p>\n<p>language: English or Finnish</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:48:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b0/1b08cc80143376ae9471b6baefd10a8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dylancj"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
