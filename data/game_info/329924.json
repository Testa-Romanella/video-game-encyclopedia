They very recently made a huge breakthrough, and produced a kind of slime that can be used to create more slime! However, control of the rate of regeneration was very quickly lost, and now the slime has started breaching containment. Even worse, it has a taste for blood, and will stop at absolutely nothing to break out of the facility.</p>\n<p>The scientists are now tasked with doing all that they can to stop the spread of slime. Things may look, feel, and even <em><strong>be</strong></em> pretty hopeless, but any time bought for evacuation is a bonus.</p>\n<p>This... wasn't in the job description.</p>\n<p>You must run around the facility, and fight off slime with the use of a powerful vacuum, an effective\u00a0squirt gun, and the use of buildable walls and barriers. I wish you luck, because you are going to need it, my friend.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Cameron Strachan:</p>\n<ul><li>Programming</li><li>User Interface Art</li><li>Level Design</li></ul>\n<p>James Burns:</p>\n<ul><li>Sound Design</li><li>Character Design</li><li>Environment Design &amp; Animation</li><li>Level Design</li></ul>\n<p>Jordan Han:</p>\n<ul><li>Sound &amp; Music Design</li><li>Tileset Art</li><li>Player Animation</li><li>Slime Animation</li></ul>\r\nFinal Note:\r\n<p>Made over 6 days for the Midsummer Jam 2019</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T04:13:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18e/18e89b08924d043c56a7694520bed5d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jordan Han"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
