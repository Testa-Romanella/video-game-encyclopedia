Offering a superb blend of lightning-fast superbike racing and hairpin curve-infested motocross events, it became an instant classic. It&#39;s got a bunch of nifty features, like two driving models (arcade and simulation), vivid graphics that look pretty nice even today and a broad selection of motorcycles to choose from. But all these look pale when compared to this game&#39;s sheer fun factor, which will make you want to keep on playing and will burn itself into your memories forever.Absolutely unforgettable, fun-packed gameplay.<br />\nTwo realism levels and two completely different racing styles - motocross and superbike<br />\nTen diverse landscapes, from the base of a canyon to the top of the Great Wall</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-05T16:32:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/823/8239a38f388adc7d3cad4b84e26c7cc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 80, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 29, "suggestions_count": 434, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 29, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Delphine Software International", "Delphine Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "Anuman Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
