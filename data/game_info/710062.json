It's always been a dream of mine to make something special out of the things I love. Now that The Boyfriend is here, you can help me make that dream come true in this \"totally innocent\" FNF Mod!<br/><br/>Our club is full of chit-chat and fun activities with all of my adorable and unique club members:<br/><strong>Sayori</strong>, the youthful bundle of sunshine who values happiness the most (but doesn't care about her own);<br/><strong>Natsuki</strong>, the deceivingly cute girl who packs an assertive punch (don't make her snap plz);<br/><strong>Yuri</strong>, the timid and mysterious one who finds comfort in the world of books (she's a cut above the rest);<br/>And, of course,\u00a0<strong>Monika</strong>, the president of the literature club! That's me!<br/><br/>I'm super excited for you to make friends with everyone, rap battle them, and help the Literature Club become a more intimate place for all my members. But I can tell already that you're a sweetheart\u2014will you promise to spend the most time with me? (Pretty please? I've been waiting for this chance again for four years.) &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:15:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bc/4bc663c4f60af272afc3a474733c8fbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dsfan2_PMB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
