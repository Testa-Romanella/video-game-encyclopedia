These noble leaders will manage key aspects of their army and population including food, weapons, recruits and other resources to get stronger and advance in the game. <br/><br/>As they march on, they will unlock new territories and production areas where individual characters will be able to use their skills to strengthen their position.  Choose wisely on which sectors to conquer and relinquish to the enemy in order to push new frontlines and find your way back to power.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/>\u2022\tBreathtaking setting composed of hand-drawn environments instead of hex grids <br/>\u2022\tTurn-based strategy game with battles and resource management focused on decision-making <br/>\u2022\tAsymmetric gameplay<br/>\u2022\tUnits are individual heroes with special traits, abilities and stories <br/>\u2022\t4 Distinct character classes: <br/>\u2022\tCombatants: protect and attack sectors <br/>\u2022\tMechanics: fortify (defend) sectors and craft items <br/>\u2022\tLeaders: organize the population to gather resources and recruit new heroes <br/>\u2022\tAcademics: heal troops and help on various tasks<br/>\u2022\tItem crafting system <br/>\u2022\tStory-driven<br/>\u2022\tEasy to learn, hard to master!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:08:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/feb/feb75ac1299cf238dd8df521cdc9306f.jpg", "website": "http://www.highlandsvideogame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 81, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 399, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Burrito Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Burrito Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
