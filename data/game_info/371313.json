It was a one-way flight but that doesnt matter! There is plenty of nutritious turf to furtilise on the small planet, so the duo quickly agreed on a mission: \"Grow a fortune, become rich!\"</p>\n<p> Sadly they got no clue what to do, so\u00a0 you'll have to signal them where to go, where to stay still and more.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Pip responds to buttoninputs on WASD + F,\u00a0</p>\n\n<p> Y\u014dki responds to pressing the Arrowkeys + rightControl</p>\n\n<p>Every plant needs Light and water, even on this planet. Pip glued a bunch of Lightbulbs on his cap, while Y\u014dki decided to wear sponges as shoes. Sadly sponges dont store water forever, so Y\u014dki will have to visit some body of water, mabye a frozen pond or a frozen lake,\u00a0 frequently. <br/><br/>The snek-mafia quickly quickly noticed Pip and Y\u014dkis activity on planet Aqualuce, so they dug a hole into the wall of their house, and call it a \"SHOP\". <br/>If either Pip or Y\u014dki talk to a snek-mafia rookie, it will offer them a carrot seed.<br/>If you dont wanna plant carrots all day long, debate with the Snek-mafia rookie by pressing left or right.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Here is a not very helpful graph that shows you, how the snek-mafia claims, these plants would behave.</p>\r\nPlantWaterLightTimeCategoryCarrotsomesomenot muchCropStarefruitsomemuchmuchCropCowlyFlowermuchsomevery muchFlowerWiggleshroomsvery muchnonemuchFlowerPantplantnot muchmuchvery muchCropBoomBloommuchnot muchsomeFlowerPowerFlowernonevery muchnot muchFlowerMelonyvery muchsomemuchCropOceanconenonesomevery, very muchBushB.U.S.Hsomenonevery, very muchBush\r\n<p>If the plants are done with growing, they should be harvested and sold to commeowters. Those fly by at rapid speed, checking out whats for sale. If they find something, they transfer the money to your virtual Toki-coin account.
