I severely underestimated how much work goes into making visual novels and I just didn't think it'd take this long.</p>\n<p>But no matter! It hath been released and I think it's alright for a first attempt. I'm proud of it. It's my child, my baby. Even if it's a little ugly, I won't let anyone say I shouldn't have given birth to it.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it. Thank you!
