However, in Nehrim the landscape is entirely hand-built and thus has a lot more variety in it than those forests in Oblivion.<br />\nHow long will it take me to beat the game?<br />\nAs opposed to Oblivion, the Main Quest, including 35 single quests, is to the fore in Nehrim. Our Main Quest isn&#39;t just much more intense than Oblivion&#39;s, but also more extensive. You can beat Oblivion in about 10 hours. This most definitely will not be possible in Nehrim. Additionally, there will be about 30 side quests.<br />\nWhat is the most profound difference to Oblivion?<br />\nThe skill system. In Nehrim, you level up by gaining experience points. You gain experience points by killing monsters and most of all for finishing quests. This is the best way to motivate the player to play them. At each level-up you get &quot;learning points&quot; you can trade for skill upgrades at a teacher - just as in the Gothic series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T18:51:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e2269cbb1ccdbfc846f0ec56a232299.jpg", "website": "https://sureai.net/games/nehrim/", "rating": 3.44, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 15, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 67, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SureAI"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["SureAI"], "esrb_rating": null}
