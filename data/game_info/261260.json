And technically you need to keep the ball in the water rather than the air... And the ball isn't so much a ball as it is a bubble...<br/><br/>OK, let's try again.<br/><br/>Super Keepy Ups is about one thing: 1 bubble, 2 fish and an undisclosed number of gravity(s?)*.<br/><br/>Super Keepy Ups is the debut game from <strong>Infinite Beta Games</strong>; born out of a love of keepy ups and a nostalgia for 2 player keyboard-crowding classics such as the Commodore 64's CJ's Elephant Antics, and DOS's Jazz Jackrabbit 2. With a single player high score mode, a local 2 player co-operative high score mode, and a menu system that is truly part of the game itself rather than a clunky break in play, Super Keepy Ups has an addictiveness and fluidity that belies it's simplicity.<br/><br/>Grab a friend, or just grab yourself, and keep that ball from dropping! And remember, Super Keepy Ups is about one thing: getting the highest score you possibly can.<br/><br/>*Disclaimer: there is only one gravity in this game.<br/><br/>Oh, and thinking about it, I'm pretty sure the plural for gravity is graviti.
