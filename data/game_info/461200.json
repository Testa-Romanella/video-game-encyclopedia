While some parts of the game may come off as inscrutable or confusing,\u00a0 ultimately your experience of those mechanics is the real game, and where the game has something concrete to say, it says it plainly.</p>\n<p>All money made from purchasing this game will go to Black and Trans crowdfunds.\u00a0\u00a0If you send a screenshot of you donating $5+ to a Black Trans person directly to @fallingstardevs on Twitter, we will give you the game for free.</p>\n<p>Logo art by Lucy Lou.
