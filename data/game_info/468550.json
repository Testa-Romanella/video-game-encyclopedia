Unity exported the build extremely blurry, and I don't know how to fix it. If anybody knows, I will publish a WebGL version.</p>\n<p>Escape the Dungeon filled with previous knights remains who attempted this adventure. You were lucky. Your next objective: Escape. Be careful, the Dungeon is hundreds of years old and is collapsing behind you.</p>\n<p>After the first 10 seconds of the game, the wall behind you collapses and causes rubble to follow you. You will need to be quick in order to escape the dungeon.</p>\n<p>Corrupt Knights inflict the player with slowness and confusion. When you are confused, your ad/left right keys are swapped.</p>\n<p>**NOTE: The finish screen looks very ugly, I agree. After the Jam,\u00a0I will make the UI of the game look much better. (Not to be Judged of Course). Also, Ignore the filenames. The name of the game is Falling Dungeon. Escape was a codename**</p>\n<p>Please notify me of\u00a0any suggestions, feedback, or bugs. Enjoy Playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T20:24:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19f/19fedb7a1a4571adf62511a91dc8ffa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nishc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
