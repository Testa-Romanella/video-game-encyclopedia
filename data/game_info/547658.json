This game was designed as a developing challenge as I have never made a 2D game and I wanted to make one in a single day. I feel really happy with this game I have managed to create within the timespan of a day and I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T09:29:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/369/36911bb43a974e533c4457cca9b6ad73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IMPULSE SLY"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
