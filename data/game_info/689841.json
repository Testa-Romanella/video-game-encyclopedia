The colors burning beneath your skin?</em></p>\n<p>Splatter is a first-person fever dream where you blast constantly-adapting enemies into neon sprays of pulp and slime. This world is one built for violence. It is a digital mindscape, surreal and yet strangely familiar, constructed by four anonymous administrators. To survive within it, you must overcome each challenge and outsmart hordes of creatures that learn as you defeat them. Blast enemies with your finger guns, chug cans of energy drinks, and maintain your brain chemistry in order to win.<br/></p>\n<p>Your victories, however, may come at a terrible price. Can you uncover the motives of your captors before it is too late? Can you survive? Can you remain sane? Can you remain yourself?</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warnings: Flashing lights, visual glitches/distortion, explicit language.</strong><br/></p>\r\nThe demo is also available on Steam.
