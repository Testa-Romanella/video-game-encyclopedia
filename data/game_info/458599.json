Most of these colors were picked out of the\u00a0<em>SMB1</em> Game Style, but some had to be taken from the <em>SMB3</em> Game Style as well. We've had dozens of different palettes for emulators that replicates those from the Virtual Consoles, the NES Classic, Composite display from the NES itself, and even one for the obscure PlayChoice 10, but no one had made one from SMM yet. So I made that my mission &amp; decided to spend my time on an\u00a0NES color palette that replicates that of SMM.</p>\n<p>I'm working hard to make this as accurate as possible.\u00a0Any suggestions for color corrections or color changes would be very appreciated. I am willing to keep this project up as much as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T05:42:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f0/9f03a9f88c8d650414ae75e7073ddaec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanielTG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
