A round is complete when you gather enough stars! Stars spawn every 10 seconds so keep moving and dodging!</p>\n<p>There are three types of shots to watch out for:</p>\n<p>Flame shots scatter randomly across the field, be careful to avoid the explosions when they land as they hurt too!</p>\n<p>Homing shots charge after you, but they're too fast for their own good and can easily pass up their target!</p>\n<p>Spike Rock shots fire rapidly at you, so just keep moving to avoid them!</p>\n\n\n<p>If you're feeling up for a bigger challenge, try some of the higher difficulties which take away health refill spawns or even put you in with only one HP!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Tips for noobs:</p>\n<p>Stars are wiped from the field between levels, but hearts stay, so try to preserve them for the end.</p>\n<p>Homing shots are faster side to side than they are up and down, so try to lead them to the side so they shoot past you.</p>\n<p>If a star is in a hard to reach place, just leave it and wait for more to spawn.</p>\n<p>With the exception of hard mode, you'll heal between levels, so take the risk for that last star so you can heal up.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know what you think! Your feedback is always valuable!</p>\n<p>Edit: If you've already downloaded, try again and both required files should be in there now!
