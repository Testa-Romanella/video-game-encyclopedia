You da bomb.</p>\n<p>The story is part of a novel I'm writing and since I haven't written out the story of\u00a0Reina, the protagonist of this story, I thought, \"Why not do it in a game?\" And so, this child was made.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Read more if you want more context of the game (maybe you don't! 'cause you know, surprises and all):</p>\n<p>In this world people have supernatural powers - powers that shouldn't\u00a0<em>exist.</em> So you can guess all of interesting things happen around here. Reina is a product of all this. Her being a man-made human, a so called homunculus.
