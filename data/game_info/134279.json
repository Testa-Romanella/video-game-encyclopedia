This is Sea Spring Clean!</p>\n<p>Let's help this little fish who wants to have a clean sea everyone by collecting the garbage along the way. However, as it grabs more trashes, its weight becomes heavier, and this makes it harder for it to avoid corals and rocks! Help it to jump by pressing the mouse left click and/or space bar. There are worms in the survival mode. Grab worms to get energy to jump higher! I wonder what would happen if it eats a lot of worms?</p>\n<p>========<br/>Game Modes:</p>\n<p>Normal - Collect all of the garbage until you reach the goal. (So far, only one level available)<br/>Survival - Endless mode to get to the highest ranking possible. Get some worms for higher jump!<br/>========</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5c/a5c3969c99367f5e51515bae42585d31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["liu-ruifu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
