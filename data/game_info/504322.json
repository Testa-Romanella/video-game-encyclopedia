You can collect powerups but powerups will only be spawning at a certain time. Powerups can affect the player. If you collect a health powerup then the player will have more hearts and the enemy can hurt you but not kill you until the player has no hearts left.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, there is one available game mode. In the future, I might consider on making more game modes and more maps.</em> </p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\nPc controls - W A S D\r\nMobile controls - Joystick\r\nNameless [Alpha] is now supporting multiple platforms.\r\n<ul><li> <strong><em>Android</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Windows</em></strong></li></ul>\r\nPlatforms that is not supported by\u00a0<strong><em>Nameless [Alpha]</em></strong><strong><em>IOS</em></strong><strong><em>GOOGLE PIXEL</em></strong><em><strong>LINUX</strong></em><strong><em>CHROME OS</em></strong>\n<br/>GET FULL ACCESS TO GAME UPDATES ARTICLE:\r\n<ul><li>https://www.patreon.com/positionV\r\n</li></ul>\r\nCome and follow the development journey\r\n<ul><li><em>Instagram</em>:\u00a0<strong><em>https://www.instagram.com/postionv/</em></strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:55:35", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["90poitu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
