Luckily, you have as much time as you'll ever need. Just don't wait until the...<br/><br/><br/><br/>4th Dawn. A game about choice, time, and people. Spend the dawn, afternoon, and night of your precious three days running between the four locations, talking to people, rummaging through trash, joining rebellion groups or underground crime syndicates, helping those in need, robbing the poor, saving the world from an ominous destruction, or condemning it to one yourself. Plan your days, make your choices wisely, but don't sweat it too much. You'll always get another try to do it all over again.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Scavenge for spare parts around the map.<br/></li><li>Craft makeshift tools and weaponry to accomplish your goals.<br/></li><li>Talk to NPCs with their own plans and actions who remember your choices.<br/></li><li>Fight in quick paced turn based combat in the Fight Club.<br/></li><li>Stage a revolution or a heist.<br/></li><li>Join forces with one of the three main factions, or go off on your own.<br/></li><li>Replay the game to achieve all 10+ endings.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T02:42:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6af/6afcd448f1223dcb9798f956462d26c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChronosTech", "Jason Czech"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["ChronosTech", "Jason Czech"], "esrb_rating": null}
