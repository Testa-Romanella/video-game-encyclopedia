Did you have plans for this weekend?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Story</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Paco is a musician whose dream to start to gain money with his talent and passion seems to have a shot, thanks to his contribution to a thrilling videogame that he's done with Marco Giorgini.\r\n</p>\n<p>The turning point could be ItAdvCon - the Italian Convention for Adventure Games - where they'll be able to showcase their work AND to meet an important publisher that may be willing to put real money on them.\r\n</p>\n<p>If that was not enough, this year ItAdvCon will be held in a luxury location - Villa Apate, near San Luca, Bologna, usually a place for more exotic and prestigious events - and Marco was able somehow to book a room so they'll be able to finish to prepare their speech together and with every possible comfort.\r\n</p>\n<p>Paco thinks that they really had a lucky hit.\r\n</p>\n<p>But did they really have it?</p>\n<p><strong>Where are you when the game starts?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, you don't know that for sure. You don't remember *anything * but you think you may be in a hotel room. But you'll have to figure out something about your recent past - in a hurry - because it seems someone wants to kill you. And that won't be necessarily your main problem for long.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Left-click: use / interact / talk to<br/>Right-click:\u00a0look at / move to<br/>To change area, click to move to the exit point, then once there, click again</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Story, Graphics and Animations by Marco Giorgini (@marcogiorgini\u00a0)</p>\n<p>Original Soundtracks by Paco Diago (@PacoDiago)</p>\n<p>Test&amp;Proofing: Paco Diago</p>\n<p>Game built with Defold engine (http://www.defold.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T08:06:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/304/304a9dfea547c913b6188cbeb2beb449.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Marco Giorgini"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
