Made with RPG Maker this is my first game that took about four months to complete as I learn the ways and is about a 10 minute length depending on the exploring you do- and I do encourage exploring to find out the lore of this place.</p>\n<p>Feel free to follow me on Twitter at @arctosofficial or support me on Ko-Fi at ko-fi.com/arctosgames for more information on future projects.
