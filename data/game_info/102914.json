Somewhere between a fun app and a useful tool lies Lienzo; experiment with big strokes, make delicate details, or paint some rad graffiti. Change how the brushes interact with the distance and trigger pressure for an optimal experience, and enjoy a full palette in your thumbs. Paint with two hands or one, and customize all the important details while the rest sits on a non-invasive UI.</p>\n<ul><li>Trigger to paint or select brush/option</li><li>Touchpad to select Hue or Saturation/Value. Don't worry, you can't change Hue while changing Sat/Val and viceversa :)</li><li>Grip buttons to select color while looking at canvas</li><li>Grip buttons to move, rotate and resize canvas when outlined</li><li>Sliders are manipulated using the touchpads. Press the 'Dist' or 'Trigger' to use that as the value (for example, a brush that paints bigger when you're far away)</li></ul>\n<p>Here's a short video tutorial</p>\n<p>Please, send your artworks and feedback to daniel.hurtadoramirez314@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Update 1.1: Added exit button, added cursor, improved file system to be relative.</p>\n<p>Now you can get the source code.
