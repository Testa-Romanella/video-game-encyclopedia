You, the Player, have to reach the cave, while destroying enemies, moving through the tough terrain and avoiding spike falls and more, in order to complete the game. The game can be quite difficult if your not paying attention, but you can always restart with <strong>R</strong>.</p>\n<p>Any feedback or criticisms would be greatly appreciated, tell me what you liked, disliked, bugs you found, hows the enemies, platform and more. I'm always open to improve myself.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>A</strong>/<strong>D</strong> or <strong>left</strong>/<strong>right</strong> arrow keys to move.</li><li><strong>W</strong>, <strong>up</strong> arrow or <strong>space </strong><strong>bar</strong> to Jump.</li><li><strong>S</strong> or <strong>down </strong>arrow keys to crouch.</li><li><strong>K </strong>or <strong>left </strong>mouse button to attack.</li><li><strong>R </strong>to restart the game.</li></ul>\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<ul><li>DungeonFont</li><li>GothicVania Cemetery</li><li>Gothicvania Swamp</li><li>GothicVania Church Pack</li><li>Retro Noisy Attack Sound Pack Lite</li><li>Retro Noisy Explosion Sound Pack Lite</li><li>30x[8bit Loops]</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:00:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83a/83ad4f449b54b907ebfa7d7679c84644.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Coder"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
