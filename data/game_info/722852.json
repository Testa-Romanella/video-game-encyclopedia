{"id": 722852, "slug": "async-trijam-152", "name": "ASYNC (Trijam #152)", "name_original": "ASYNC (Trijam #152)", "description": "ASYNC\r\n<p>Async is a polyrhythm game made for Trijam #152.\u00a0It features notes falling from five columns, each column having a different subdivision of the first column. Because the game was made in 5.5 hours, I didn't have time to fix a phasing bug, but it works with the \"async\"\u00a0idea.</p>\n<p>The theme of the game jam is \"Leave me\u00a0alone!\". While the game was designed independently from that theme, it's not hard to relate. Shortly after beginning, you will want the different columns, all competing for your attention, to leave you alone. Also, you have to leave the grey notes alone, so there's that.</p>\n<p>Coding took about 4 hours. I had to go over since\u00a0I wasted so much time on a timing system that I ultimately scrapped. After that I spent an hour and a half\u00a0making it look and sound nicer.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The game needs to be played in full screen. Use the a, s, d, f, and g keys to hit the note in each respective column. The closer the note is to the bottom bar, the better the score. Hitting the note too high or letting it fall will result in a miss, which counts as -1 point. 10 misses end the game.</p>\n<p>My High Score: 701</p>\n<p>Only hit the colored notes. The grey notes help show the subdivision. Every four red beats, the pattern will switch up a little, and the game\u00a0will get slightly faster.</p>\r\nMaking the Game\r\n<p>The game was made for the three hour trijam. While I didn't finish it all in 3 hours, I still finished the project. I had to cut a few features that I\u00a0hope to add eventually, such as columns trading places, and changing the chord the notes play. I also hope to eventually fix the phasing issue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T04:01:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb959df026967a4ec1d885bb3d547940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tempust Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
