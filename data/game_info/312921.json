Who has the better reactions?<br/><br/>An ingenious game idea and a really fancy design ensure maximum fun!<br/>Decide as fast as possible, whether the three symbols in front of you make a trio or not. Be faster than your opponent - but watch out, because mistakes will not be forgiven.<br/>You can decide how many rounds you want to play and how long each round should last.  <br/><br/><br/>These are the Trio rules:<br/><br/>The three pattern and shapes have to either be the same for each symbol or completely different to build a Trio.<br/><br/>The Player who finds the Trio faster gets the point.
