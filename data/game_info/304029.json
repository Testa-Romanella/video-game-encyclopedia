Each attraction has different environments and goals. Some are more scary than others, but they all have the same intention, to make a good frightening experience.</p>\n<p>Each attraction has a rating composed of five stars. One star attractions are slightly scary, while 5 star attractions will push you to the limits of your fear.<br/>Starting out, Feelings Adrift will let you play three attractions: Black Hole, Hospital and Dark Room. More will come in future updates.\u00a0<br/>When you complete each attraction you'll win one gold key. When you obtain all the keys you'll have access to a 5 star attraction which is incredibly terrifying and different from any other experience in the game.<br/>Accept the challenges that we propose and fight your fear.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-25T02:51:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/557bbebadb4b10441926ac008ca71355.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Murias"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
