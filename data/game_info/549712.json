Each turn, a <strong>new</strong> facial trait type is selected and you <strong>can only match players of matching features</strong> based on that trait (e.g. matches are based on mouths when the mouth trait is selected). Get points towards new <strong>clues</strong> by making matches with faces that contain the <strong>target feature</strong>. Be careful, if your <strong>current match</strong> does not contain anyone with the <strong>target feature</strong>, you will <strong>lose a life</strong>. Lose all your lives and it is <strong>game over</strong>!
