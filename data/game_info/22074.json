Gather information and search the house for clues as you form your own conclusions about the evening's mysterious events.FEATURES<ul><li><strong>Multiple Endings</strong>: Finding the true killer is ideal, of course, but maybe building a plausible case against one of the other characters is good enough to get you off the hook!</li><li> <strong>Unique and Compelling Characters</strong>: Play as Miss Fortune, a delightfully caustic anti-heroine who has already been widowed nine times. But this time, she didn't do it (really!), and she'll have to solve the mystery herself to prove it!<br/></li><li><strong>Immersive Story</strong>: Sharply written dialog full of choices ensures a thoroughly immersive narrative.<br/></li><li><strong>Voice-acting</strong>: Each character is fully voiced, with over 1700 voiced lines throughout the game!<br/></li><li><strong>Beautiful Visuals</strong>: Detailed, searchable backgrounds and slick visual effects like rain, fog and variable lighting enhance the aesthetic experience.<br/></li><li><strong>Time Runs Short</strong>: The incompetent police are on their way.
