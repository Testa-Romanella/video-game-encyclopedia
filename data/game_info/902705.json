Many years later it became a empting place to many brave explorers and people looking for some futuristic technologies. The robots are still under the ground, walking aimlessly until they see another victim to slaughter.</p>\n\n<p>You are playing as an artificial stickman who was created by a mysterious figure using a neo-printer. They asked for favor, and so you begin your descend through the ruins of what used to be a striving city, collecting anything that may prove useful through your travels.</p>\n\n<p>Warning:</p>\n<p>This game will probably not lie up to your expactations. I'm far from a professional video game maker, I just do this for fun, as a hobby.
