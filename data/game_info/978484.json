You must be quite the special guest since our doors only open to those who truly commit to the cause. I can only hope you know what I mean...<br/><br/>You are most welcome (even encouraged) to talk with the rest of our precious participants, but be mindful, they DO not like whining. <br/><br/>Enjoy your stay ~~~<br/><br/><h3>*DESCRIPTION*</h3><br/>This is a short game that explores the concept of SAFETY. You will awaken in a room with three strangers and no knowledge of what has happened to you. In isolation, you are to communicate with them to find out what this place is and why you are here. This story has five different endings, the outcome of which will be determined by the choices you make. Do you think you are brave enough to leave? And, what awaits past the door? Perhaps, you and I are not so different, it may be that we have met in SAFETY before.<br/><br/>And for those of you still there, I hope this short story will aid you on your journey.<br/><br/>Please consult the Readme file in the games folder for the controller button layout.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-15T08:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/316/3164d895c13118feea51b6505743e143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CHRONOPHOBIA"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CHRONOPHOBIA"], "esrb_rating": null}
