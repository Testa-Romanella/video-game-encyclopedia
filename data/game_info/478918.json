Fortunately, his machine was not damaged, and was working exactly as he intended. Rather than simply showing people's futures at the fair, as he initially intended , he decides to go through time and kill every vile person throughout history. Before he can do that, a robot named C.L.O.C.K.W.O.R.K. comes out of the machine and warns him that the Time Police are trying to stop him from going through with his plan. Therefore, he must avoid them at all cost while racing to the past and completing his personal quest. Can you help him achieve his goal?</p><p>Feel free to follow us on Twitter:</p><p>https://twitter.com/MuttlyM</p><p>https://twitter.com/ricksterv1998<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0805a35a8df5759aaf54c20bc46918.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rick Velez"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
