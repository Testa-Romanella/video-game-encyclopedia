The Evil Wizard and his Eternal Orb no longer hold dominion over this land\u201d.</p>\n<p>It has been a thousand years since\u2026</p>\n<p>And now, bandits, orcs, highwaymen and all sorts of vile creatures have gotten bolder. Where they roamed before as mere nuisance, they now dare more often, and even well armed escorts are no longer safe from their attacks. They wander from their wilderness and abandoned ruins of the Land of Rivar to threaten cities within our borders. Sanctuary can no longer be guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Then came a far worse day; a day that saw superstition pierce to reality. Dragons, as told in ancient tales from a time beyond memory, began terrorizing our lands. By these tales, it was believed that upon every new moon, the sacrifice of a young maiden, pure in heart and and virtue, would spare the fate of the dragon\u2019s breath. And thus the villages renewed these rituals of terror in order to save themselves.</p>\n<p>The dragons sounded a flood of orcs, kobolds, ogres and all sorts of deformed humanoids to rally and attack. Once believed our symbol of strength, peace and protection, the King\u2019s castle was ransacked a year after the first of the dragons was seen. The great Land of Rivar was now reduced to a vassal colony and would pay tribute to all things evil.</p>\n<p>Sages and scribes scurried through the ancient texts, desperate to find answers. In the scant remains of the Lyceum of the King's castle, only a fragment of the ancient poem was found:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe daemon hath been defeated and a new day begun.<br/>A day to last a thousand years \u2018til the setting of the sun.\u201d</p>\n<p>The scholars argued on its meaning. In the end, they settled to a one common fear: \u201cNikaedor\u201d. The legends told his power was so great that he could reverse his own death by himself.\u00a0 All shuddered at the thought.</p>\n<p>The King sent forth his finest on a scouting mission to the old ruins of Nikaedor's lair; warriors of unyielding strength, magic wielders of cunning sorcery. After the passing of several moons, their bodies floated in the moat of our once-beloved castle . Struck with shock and grief, a journal was retrieved from their watery grave. The final entry petrified those with ears to hear it:</p>\n<p>\u201cNikaedor has returned. Death to those who fail to pay tribute on this day and forever. Hail Nikaedor!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>** SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS **</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Realms\u00a0Of Quest</strong>\u00a0is a trilogy of games for the Commodore VIC20.
