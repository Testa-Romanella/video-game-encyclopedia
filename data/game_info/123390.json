Was still amazing to have the support of everyone else on-site, as well as to give input and assist to whoever I could.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThanks ya'll for a cool #GGJ17 :)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t------------------------\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8ab1615ff56d86e2e6e9f305c915148.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Steven Tu"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
