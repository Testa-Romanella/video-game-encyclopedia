Larry's job is to collect and deliver different shaped blocks to the special portal in the centre of his world, so they can be teleported into the top of the falling blocks game called TeTron (a Tetris clone game [that doesnt actually exist]) for the players (in the real world) to place them. unfortunately, the game has glitched, and the portals have spawned a collection of singularities that destroy your blocks. So, collect the blocks, fly around to the centre of the level with the black hole in the big glass area, and <strong>press space-bar</strong> to release your collected blocks into the singularity.</p>\n<p>This was a one week game jam, with three student game designers.
