Balance your budget and global cheer reserves to ensure as many kids as possible get judged. <br/></p>\n<p>________________________________</p>\n<p>Things around the North Pole are a bit old fashioned and it was starting to bother one elf with an eye for the future. Reginald preferred technology to the wooden horses and dollies his peers were creating. A self-taught coder he had a plan to revolutionize things around the Workshop with a simple little app he called \"Naughty/Nice\". </p>\n<p>This app streamlines the whole process of list moderation for Santa. Children are auto-populated into the system and Santa must swipe left to place the child on the Naughty List and swipe right to place them on the Nice List. Santa must allow pay attention to the two resources of the holiday season: Christmas Cheer and Workshop Magic. If either resource gets too high or too low it could have unfortunate consequences!</p>\n<p>Did I mention you're Santa? Cause you're Santa. Check the lining of the suit it's all explained there. Enjoy your new app!</p>\n\n<p>Made for the Christmas Jam 2016, #xmasjam16.</p>\n<p>http://joemag.games</p>\n<p>@joemagiv</p>\n<p>Source: https://github.com/joemagiv/NaughtyNice</p>\n<p>Android build released!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c08dcd5eef401d8718fe73217ce89fb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["joemag"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
