By second or third grade, some students have become visual learners. During the late elementary years some students, primarily females, become auditory learners. Yet, many adults, especially males, maintain kinesthetic and tactual strengths throughout their lives.\" (Teaching Secondary Students Through Their Individual Learning Styles, Rita Stafford and Kenneth J. Dunn; Allyn and Bacon, 1993).</p>\n<p>** Visit us at www.greysprings.com<br/>** Contact us: contact@greysprings.com<br/>Privacy Policy: You can feel safe using our app because we don\u2019t collect your kids\u2019 personal information.<br/>http://www.greysprings.com/privacy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e38686f74f49d1efacb3e682d2d475c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["greysprings"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
