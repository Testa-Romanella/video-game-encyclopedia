A new way to experience another masterpiece! Unofficially remade on the GameBoy.\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nI am in no way associated with Team Cherry, I am just a fan and an indie GB Studio Developer.\r\nSilk Song is a property by Team Cherry. This is a free unofficial fan project and a love letter to the eternal masterpiece. Please support Team Cherry and their official titles.\r\nHello there! I'm once again remaking a masterpiece by the Higher Beings. I am using GB Studio by Chris Maltby as an engine to make this game.\r\nControls:\r\nFUNCTIONKEYBOARD CONTROLCONSOLE CONTROLInteract [Bench]W / UPUPTaunt [Away from Bench]W / UPUPBind [Heal]S / DOWNDOWNMoveA and DLEFT and RIGHTNeedle Strike [Attack]J or XB ButtonJumpK or ZA ButtonUse Tool / SkillL or C or SHIFTSELECTTool / Skill CycleI or ENTERSTART\r\nWarning:\r\nThis game is different from the E3 Demo, and it has a lot of bugs.\r\n<ul><li>GBC, SGB, GBA or Emulators are the means to play this game.</li><li>Like the previous demake, this build doesn't have the Pogo [Lunge] mechanic integrated in it, as well as upwards slashing.</li><li>Beautiful pixel art inspired by MS-DOS and PICO-8 styles.</li><li>No Rosary / Rosary Strings [Currency] yet.</li><li>No quests and crafting yet.</li><li>Boss attack patterns are altered to fit GameBoy limitations.</li><li>Known bugs prevent some mini bosses and or major bosses to stay on screen even after it has been killed. [They can still be a threat, so please restart your game and fight carefully next time.]</li><li>Other bugs sometimes stop the\u00a0Player animations after certain tasks. [Exit and Re-enter area to reload animation frames.]</li><li>There's also a bug that the engine confuses the Player \"Falling\" instead of \"On Ground\"\u00a0when standing on certain platforms. [There's no harm in it, except you cannot use ground skills/tools while on these platforms.]</li><li>There is an early easter egg in the game. [Do not leave the area yet! You might find it after you defeat a certain foe.]</li></ul>\r\nBGM and SFX credits are as follows;\r\n\r\nTitle [In Game]Track usedAuthorCopyrightTitle ScreenThat was year 2014JAM, MonsterovichCC0, Public DomainCutsceneApple of ApathySongerson, SGS Module 55CC0, Public DomainGame Over ScreenThe Sad TruthKr\u00fcmel [crumb], 0723CC0, Public DomainMoss GrottoForestry\u00a0ThedinosaurCC0, Public DomainMoss Mother ThemeShort Loop 4Songerson, SGS Module 14CC0, Public DomainDeep Docks Lava SFXKick Kick Kick CrashKr\u00fcmel [crumb], 0723CC0, Public DomainDeep Docks Elevator SFXFast Wind GustEmber1765[DeerTears]CC0, Public DomainRoom ArenaShort Loop 4Songerson, SGS Module 14CC0, Public DomainLace ThemeShort Loop 2Songerson, SGS Module 11CC0, Public DomainMask ShardSwing to VictoryKr\u00fcmel [crumb], 0723CC0, Public Domain", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T06:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22bfe696beaa6b0f522d18d18e27c615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Elvies"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
