It features a neat auto-aim system, a (buggy but effective) inventory system, and an off-hand system for using items. It was written using Construct 2, and the graphical assets were created entirely using its highly-capable in-built image editor. Audio was sourced from various locations, and tweaked with Audacity.</p>LOWREZJAM2016<br/>THE BRIEF<p>The aim of the jam is to create a game with a total screen resolution of 64x64. Terminated Sentence fits that brief perfectly, having no effects rendered outside of a 64x64 pixel grid. The version you see above is simply scaled to fit the window.<br/></p><p>In addition to the Jam specs, I wanted to have a personal challenge. The Jam suggests imagining a hand-held device - mine has two buttons (Z and X), a START button (Enter), and a D-Pad. I'm familiar with low-res, so I decided to stretch myself elsewhere. I focus a lot on random level generation, so for this game I went for hand-drawn levels and a storyline.</p><p><strong>PROGRESS: </strong>Still missing an ending, but focusing on adding a few new environmental features before heading out for work this weekend. Hopefully I'll find the time to use these cool features to make more levels, but in the meantime I'm updating one last time before Monday with bugfixes and tweaks, a new level, new audio, some changes to old levels. 0032 update: Quick post-jam update to fix the loader - it now doesn't pre-load sounds, so the game should get to playing much faster, and I fixed the 'press any key' dialogue, which I'd fired and forgotten about.<br/></p><p>HOW CAN I HELP?<br/><strong>GIVE FEEDBACK!</strong><br/><strong>Either directly contact the developer via Twitter</strong> or <br/><strong>Right here on itch, in the comments section below</strong>.<br/>As long as the jam is ongoing feedback will be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Come back and play again come voting time (Monday 8AM GMT) in case there's any new content! Saved progress should migrate to updated versions.</p><strong>More from this developer:</strong><ul><li>Rocketfella on itch.io and Google Play</li><li>Follow on Twitter</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0db/0db5a5ea377fa2c9eaded2ce7cc4b3a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chilly_durango"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
