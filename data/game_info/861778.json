Roll and bounce around to  get to the goal as fast as possible. <br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS AND TUTORIAL</strong> - Unfortunately, there is no in-game tutorial due to time constraints.  I strongly suggest reading at least the controls here!\r\n</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Move.\r\n</p>\n<p>Z - Jump.\r\n</p>\n<p>X - Dash.  You can dash in 8 directions by holding the Arrow Keys!\r\n</p>\n<p>You can only Dash once in the air\u2026 Usually (more on this later).\r\n</p>\n<p>If you Dash into a wall or floor, you will automatically Dash-Roll along the wall/floor.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can press Z (or X) to jump out of a Dash-Roll.\r\n</p>\n<p>Important! - Wall Jumping out of a Dash Roll resets your ability to Dash in the air!\r\n</p>\n<p>Try this: Dash into a Wall -&gt; Roll Dash -&gt; Wall Jump -&gt; Repeat!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>RULES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have 10 seconds to get to the portal at the end of each stage.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you run out of time, you\u2019ll lose a life, but must <em>still</em> reach the portal.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you run out of lives, you\u2019ll return to the level select map.\r\n</p>\n<p>Each area on the level select map consists of four stages back-to-back.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once you complete an area, you\u2019ll get an area score.\r\n</p>\n<p>You get 100 points per second remaining, and 250 points for each gem obtained.\r\n</p>\n<p>Go  for a high score!
