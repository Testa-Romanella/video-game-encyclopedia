By doing this you will erase all blocks in this rectangle and they will be replaced by new blocks. You keep on doing this till the time runs out, and try to gain your highest score possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0There are two game modes, Relative timer and fixed Timer, in the first mode you'll also gain extra time for deleting blocks so you can play longer if you are fast enough. With the second mode you don't get extra time for deleting blocks but just points added to your score so here you try to get the highest amount of points in the given time period.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T08:01:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dc/8dcd1a1bdd933c5c76d5ac48e96a73de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joyrider3774"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
