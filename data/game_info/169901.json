With the new VRX hardware, you can put yourself in the game and fight those nasty viruses in this endless dungeon crawler. But be warned - you are foreign to the computer too, so be careful where you shoot as you might hurt yourself. Trust me, it hurts A LOT.</p><p>Still in dev - made this for a game-jam held between my co-workers. Was quite fun!
