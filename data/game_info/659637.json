The limitation was to only use Kenney's game assets and the theme was 'Rotation'. <br/></p>\n<p>Made with Processing.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>There are 3 difficulty modes:</p>\n<ul><li>1) Easy mode with a 3x3 pattern grid. 9 pieces in total.</li><li>2) Normal mode with a 5x5 pattern grid. 25 pieces in total.</li><li>3) Hard mode with a 7x7 pattern grid. 49 pieces in total.</li></ul>\n<p>Once you choose a difficulty, the game will begin. Now all you need to do is select and rotate pieces until all of them are in the right rotation! (Tip: If there are gray-ish transparent pixels over a pattern, it isn't in it's correct rotation). There is also a timer and a count of pieces that need to be rotated up top to help you keep track of things.<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/pattern-pack</li><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/game-icons</li><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/interface-sounds</li><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/music-jingles</li><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-audio</li></ul>\n<p>Font: <br/>https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Delius?query=delius</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9c4f0ea57fb50654400631743eeee8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["qewer33"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
