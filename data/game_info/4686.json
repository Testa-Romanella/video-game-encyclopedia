The restricted zone became a Mecca for marauders and criminals who hunted for artifacts and thrills of dead city street racing.<br />\nOutrageous speed, rivers of blood, brutal cars, equipped with instruments of destruction: spikes, saws and blades, and don&#39;t forget the boosters. Hundreds of hungry zombies roam the streets, jumping on cars and trying to get to the drivers. To survive there and return to tell the tale is a real challenge.<br />\n1-2 players<br />\nSIXAXIS Motion Sensitive<br />\nHDTV screen resolution: 720p<br />\nDUALSHOCK\u00ae3<br />\nNetwork Features<br />\nSoftware subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
