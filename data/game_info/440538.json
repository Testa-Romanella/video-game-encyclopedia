Each mech has two pilots controlling it. One to control movement and positioning and one to control aiming and shooting. So you will have to work with you co-pilot and other mech companions to win the game. To win the game you and your team will fight against the other team to secure the objective and gain points. Once one of the mechs on fills their score bar that team wins the round. You can also win rounds by depleting the other teams lives. The first team to 5 round wins, wins the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>XBox One Controls:</p>\n<p>Pilot 1 (Movement):</p>\r\n\r\nLeft Trigger(LT) - Jump\r\nLeft Bumper(LB) - Dash (When you have the dash power-up)\r\nLeft Analog Stick - Move\r\n\r\n<p>Pilot 2 (Combat):</p>\r\n\r\nRight Trigger(RT) - Shoot\r\nRight Analog Stick - Aim\r\n\r\n<p>PS4 Controls:</p>\r\n\r\nLeft Trigger(L2) - Jump\r\nLeft Bumper(L1) - Dash (When you have the dash power-up)\r\nLeft Analog Stick - Move\r\n\r\n<p>Pilot 2 (Combat):</p>\r\n\r\nRight Trigger(R2) - Shoot\r\nRight Analog Stick - Aim\r\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Artists: Jon Gilleland and Haley Peterson</p>\n<p>Programmers: Connor Yarnott and Michael Anderson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T04:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad3/ad38c3624fb82f4a905d927bd6fba6fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yarnottc7892"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
