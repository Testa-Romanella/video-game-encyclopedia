Cities shining like the stars in night sky. Merciful rulers. Loyal generals who sometime might betray their leaders. Old and faded map, stories about countless people\u2019s dream, hope and despair. It was my dream as a child to unfold them as a game.<br/><br/>After a decade of creating games for the company, I quit after I realized that there is nothing left other than being dragged by reality and grow old. So began a journey of 8 years in development. And this is the result.<h3>Welcome to this chaotic world</h3><br/>Army and Strategy is a turn based strategy game based on Europe and Middle-East in the cage of crusaders. You need to survive between ambitious rulers dreaming of building an empire, treacherous neighbours that longs to burn your kingdom, the church that always demands unreasonable demands. Survive and build your kingdom\u2019s legacy that will last centuries.<h3>Hard yet tender</h3><br/>After drawing hard and straight outline, we drew unique faces for our characters. Then we had them stand in front of solid color tone background and brought them to life by our in-house software. Behold! They laugh, rage and tells us their story with their chewy and tender movements.<h3>Two types of play</h3><br/>There is a Scenario mode where you will follow a character\u2019s story and Sandbox mode where you can conquer the world without any restriction. Each mode are connected to each other and will affect other mode. Good choices and decisions from past games will lead your future plays to success.<h3>Friend or Enemy</h3><br/>Neighbouring kingdoms remembers your behaviour and will react to it. Critical mistakes brings dissent and soon lead to war. If you react according to other\u2019s personality, they too will open their mind.<h3>Accusation</h3><br/> In 11th century, ones without faith were either barbarians beyond the borders or heretics that will be burned at stakes. Every kingdom is under influence of 1 religion. Which will demand for the kingdom to prove their faith.<h3>Conspiracy and backroom deals</h3><br/>Every june, a meeting is held where everyone of same faith gathers to condemns and denounce each other. Kingdoms will condemn each other, religious leaders will stop a  war or demand a crusade. You must do anything possible to turn participant\u2019s opinion to your liking including bribes, threats and all kinds of dirty tricks.<br/>All will be forgiven in the name of God.<h3>Easy choice and terrible cost</h3><br/>There are many choices before you start a war. However when a war begins everything will be come down to either of 2 choices. Will you burn them? Or will you be burnt?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c1/7c13a70533ce9399cbe7df4d4fa3c406.jpg", "website": "http://www.piedpipersent.com/en/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 85, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 84, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 443, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pied Pipers Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NEOWIZ"], "esrb_rating": null}
