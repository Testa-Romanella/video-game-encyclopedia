Bring your friends into the frontier in your own private server, or make new friends (and enemies) in large public multiplayer servers. Play peacefully in co-op, or use the dynamic multiplayer faction system to band together and split apart dynamically as allegiances change.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Build ships from scratch and travel to new planets</h3></strong>Your first planet is where you\u2019ll learn to survive, but that\u2019s just the start. Build your very own starship and use it to colonise new worlds. It won\u2019t be easy, and only the most successful colonies will be able to pool the resources and knowledge necessary to break orbit. Once you launch, the stars hold brand-new planets, new biomes, bosses and challenges.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Craft, research, loot and exploit your environment</h3></strong>You\u2019ll need to prepare to take on this hostile part of the galaxy. Get mining, farming, growing, developing, researching, and building hundreds of different items, from winter combat gear to advanced laboratories. Find something you can\u2019t work out for yourself. Strap on your handcrafted laser rifle and venture out into the unknown to explore dungeons, procedural bases, NPC stores and much more.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Defend what you\u2019ve built, or take on the galaxy</h3></strong>Defend your colony with fast-paced combat that utilizes physics like bullet drop, projectile speed and spread. Thwart enemy raids on your base with your stock of handcrafted grenades. Tired of just defending? Lay waste to enemy bases with destructible terrain as you wield everything from rusty old carbines to nuke launchers and energy weapons that harness the power of lightning!<br/><br/><strong><h3>Develop and construct advanced bases for protection</h3></strong>Grow from a tiny outpost into an advanced, nuclear-powered fortress. Manage resources carefully and choose research paths based on the items and challenges you encounter on each planet. Watch out, though: the bigger your colony gets, the more of a target it becomes for raiders (and jealous friends).<br/><br/><strong><h3>Automate work and train up a team</h3></strong>Even out here, you\u2019re not alone. Save AI survivors and build a colony together. A range of unique stats, perks and flaws mean every colonist has something different to contribute. As your AI colonists complete tasks they\u2019ll level up and get smarter, stronger and faster. Best of all, you can assign tasks and orders to NPCs to do the grunt work for you and prioritize their roles based on those skills. Want to take a break from mining to destroy an underground alien nest? Let your colonists handle that for you!<br/><br/><strong><h3>And Remember</h3></strong><br/><br/>Your ship may be in ruins, your ammunition running low, and your teammates scattered across the surface, but remember this:<br/><br/>You\u2019re more than just another adventurous spirit.<br/><br/>You\u2019re a Farworld Pioneer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-26T05:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb2/fb2c899944d94807cc7b28191f291175.jpg", "website": "https://farworldpioneers.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Igloosoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild"], "esrb_rating": null}
