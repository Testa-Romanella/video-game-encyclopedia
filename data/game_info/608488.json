I wasn't going to submit to begin with, but I saw the jam on itch and got inspired by the theme and wildcards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wasn't finished. Below is what I have in mind for the finished product. For now you can run around a map transforming passing villagers into fungi for all eternity. As I say below, my goal was to add a soul flame for every one you hit so it fuels your shots and even refine the souls which have different values based on colour and can be used to trade. Couldn't do it. Just the shooting and stuff. Too many things for uni.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>It's a game about a necromancer collecting souls to power his attacks. The souls also serve as the main currency in the world, though mostly on the black market / underground community.</p>\n<p>Your focus is to build up your army by mutating villagers into your minions.</p>\n<p>I also tried to implement a no UI system. The amount and color of souls tells you both how much ammo and money you have. I added some sparks that float around to indicate how much HP the player has... I don't know if it'll work but it's a start.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T08:44:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2b/f2b9e4f682487f20b821dd8454362d01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Touff97"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
