You can expect some controls to be messy, you can expect bugs - I will work on fixing them before the final release.</em></p><p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> <em>If the game is lagging on your PC, download the low quality edition - this is only here temporarily until I implement a quality selection menu in the game. This should fix if you have bad FPS.</em></p>\n<strong>PROFESSIONAL THIEF DEMO</strong>\n<p>Professional Thief is a first person game in which you take the role of a new thief who is just starting his criminal career. The game will take you to different locations - this demo contains two of them - where you will have a specific goal. Your task is to figure out what is the best way to escape and finish the level - there are lots of ways to do this.</p>\n<p>For each level you will have a specific set of tools on you which you can use to progress through the level. The only tools in the demo are a\u00a0<strong>sledge hammer</strong> used to smash walls and windows,\u00a0<strong>lockpick</strong> which allows you to break locks, and a\u00a0<strong>pistol</strong> which you can use to defend yourself from the enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>You can expect more levels, tools and features in the future. Until then, you can give me some feedback, suggestions, and bug reports. Have fun!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T04:42:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c7/8c77fcf111387c6a1a62f1b5ae29d395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["codename420"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
