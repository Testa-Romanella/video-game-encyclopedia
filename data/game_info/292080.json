Most of the cases he works on are unremarkable domestic disputes. Odette Green\u2019s case probably won\u2019t be any different.<br/><br/>Backbone's gameplay is a new take on point-and-click adventure, featuring smell-based stealth mechanics and extensive branching dialogues reminiscent of classic CRPGs. As Howard, you must traverse the different districts of a now walled-off Vancouver to sniff out clues, collect evidence, interrogate witnesses, choose which leads to follow, and unravel The City\u2019s secrets.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T23:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db6/db681cf969d69f68872914fc6d40eb8f.jpg", "website": "https://eggnut.net/", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 752, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 12}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 39, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 40, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["EggNut"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EggNut"], "esrb_rating": null}
