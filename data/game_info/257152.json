{"id": 257152, "slug": "everythings-too-far", "name": "Everything's Too Far", "name_original": "Everything's Too Far", "description": "<p>(Make sure to click inside the game window to move the camera correctly)\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an autobiography. I'm a very small person, you see. So most mornings I actually do have to climb one or two things to get what I need for classes. \"Everything is too Far\" is an exaggeration of that daily struggle. Using WASD to move and SPACE to jump, you play as me, jumping\u00a0on top of counters, step stools, and books to get ready for the day, whether that's starting breakfast, or getting my supplies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I thought this game would be easier to make than it really was. Turns out, creating a jump that feels right in a 3D space is extremely hard, and the amount of play-testing I\u00a0had to do to achieve what I\u00a0have was astronomical.\u00a0 Not to mention getting all the small details correct. How the camera worked, how fast you should move, getting all of those tiny details right was the hardest part, and probably the least fun.\u00a0What's interesting to me is I have done a game with jump in 3D before, and that wasn't nearly as hard. Yet, since that was on a different computer, I didn't have access to the code. I\u00a0think the most fun part of the process was building the world itself. Trying to create a 3D platformer (sort of) that wasn't linear presented two big challenges:\u00a0orienting the player, and letting them know where to go first. The creation of the worldspace lent itself to playing around with sizing, different materials, lighting, and decoration, all of which with the goal of the player being able to figure out where they are in relation to the world. Overall, while I won't say it's the best game in the world, I'm proud of what I\u00a0was able to create in the time I was given.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b0/6b081a4424908cd3d8f03611a6d295d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kreetin7"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
