This is an arcade space shooter with vector graphics. The game is still in development with GameMaker Studio 2.</p>\n<p>The idea is to create a game without sprites for visuals. Instead I will use lines to draw everything on the screen and some not visible sprite as hit boxes.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: W/A/S/D</p>\n<p>Shoot: Left Mouse Click.</p>\n<p>Bomb: Right Mouse Click.</p>\n<p>(Compatible with Xbox controller)<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This DEMO is just a loop and the first boss is not finished. I've been working on this game since the beginning of 2021 but I didn't make much progress.</p>\n<p>Thank you for downloading!</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T10:08:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f66/f66b068439dc6bd371badf6e7a1abf89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adrian Alberto Vazquez"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
