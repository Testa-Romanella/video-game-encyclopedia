Please ALLOW THE POPUP and don't worry if the popup starts moving around, IT'S NOT A VIRUS! Thanks for playing!</p><p>Tips:<br/>Use Chrome! Firefox should be fine too. Safari isn't great, but it works. IE doesn't work at all!<br/>Resize the popup to move around<br/>Move the popup to give yourself space<br/>Watch out for the dangerous maximize and close browser buttons<br/>You lose energy when you resize the screen. When your energy runs out, it's game over!<br/>Use browser/OS shortcuts for maximum skill (Alt+Tab is your friend)<br/>The game is balanced for 1920x1080, but maybe you can get an advantage with other resolutions?</p><p><strong>by @foolmoron for Ludum Dare 31<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Source: </strong><strong>GitHub</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3ee2e345cc8100c357d7adc87562c947.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["foolmoron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
