{"id": 25158, "slug": "milons-secret-castle", "name": "Milon's Secret Castle", "name_original": "Milon's Secret Castle", "description": "<p>\n        It is a world where music is the language of the people. An evil \n        warlord from the north arrives and captures the castle. The princess \n        is imprisoned deep within the castle, and the world's musical \n        instruments are taken and hidden away. Our hero, Milon, takes it upon \n        himself to fight the warlord, rescue the princess and recover the \n        people's musical instruments. He has only his wits and the magical \n        Bubble to aid him on his quest. Help Milon along the way by looking \n        for hidden doors, finding secret items and defeating fierce enemies. \n        Make sure to look for the shops inside the castle, where you can buy \n        hints and valuable items. Whenever Milon finds a Music Box, he will be \n        transported to a bonus stage. Each instrument you find will add a \n        layer to the background music. Try to grab all seven instruments to \n        create a performance worthy of a music-themed game.\n      </p>\n<p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
