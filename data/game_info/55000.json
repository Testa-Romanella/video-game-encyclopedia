{"id": 55000, "slug": "crystal-kingdom-dizzy", "name": "Crystal Kingdom Dizzy", "name_original": "Crystal Kingdom Dizzy", "description": "<p>Crystal Kingdom Dizzy is an adventure video game featuring the character Dizzy released in December 1992 by Codemasters. The Oliver Twins\u2014who were heavily involved in the design and programming of previous Dizzy games\u2014had less involvement with this one.</p>\n<p>The game is the last title to date in the core Dizzy series.</p>\n<p>At \u00a39.99, this was the first full-price Dizzy game released for home computers; previous games had been released at budget prices (\u00a32-3). This elicited some criticism, as despite the much higher tag, the game was no bigger or more complex than its much lower-priced predecessors.</p>\n<p>The Spectrum version of the game knocked Rainbow Islands from the top of the UK sales chart, and prevented Street Fighter II from being number one. This version was voted number 70 in the Your Sinclair Readers Top 100 Games of All Time.</p>\n<p>The Commodore 64 version was notable for being the only core game in the series, to be entirely coded for that platform as opposed to porting over the graphic designs from the Spectrum versions as previously.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98d/98d16535f5b1263b18d988383fdbe297.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Codemasters"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
