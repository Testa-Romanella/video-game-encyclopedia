All excited, he takes on the assignment\u00a0 (with big help from the ship's computer Gart.T.H) to clean the surrounding space. What he doesn't know is that an evil narcissistic Game Designer is luring them straight into a trap. Steve feels that his first day on the job turns into a surrealistic nightmare, while the evil game designer has a different view on the matter; it's just a fun game\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\"I recently became a Game Designer (focused on narrative and concept) and felt I didn't have that many portfolio pieces from school that showcased my talent. So I made this game in which I try to put my strengths, and of course also my weaknesses, on display.
