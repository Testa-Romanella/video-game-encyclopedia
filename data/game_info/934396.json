Salvage buildings for resource, to kick start your civilization.</p>2. Fix broken buildings is cheaper than building a new one (But be aware that fixing high level buildings will probably deplete your metal resources in the early game)Note that in the video, after the\u00a0shelter is repaired, the human generator started to work. The human generator will automatically generate human when you have enough shelter.<br/>\n<p>3. Buildings will not produce output if no human is assigned to it</p>Assign 1 human for 50% efficiency, and 2 for 100% efficiency.<br/>\n<p>4. Make sure you have enough water and food for your humans</p>\n<p>If you don't have enough food, some or all of your human will die. The game will end if the latter happens.</p><p>5. Make sure you have enough energy to block the meteor .</p>\n<p>Recommended start: fix a shelter, then fix water extractor and carbon stripper, then assign human on them</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T17:21:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/086/0866eafeb2a1439a22db577d31953c11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kyboon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
