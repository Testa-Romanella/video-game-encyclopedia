Kiera is happy to receive the call, but soon after her arrival finds that things are not at all how she remembers them to be. What are these agents hiding, and why didn't they tell her the whole story? What is the true nature of the Blackwater \"Witch\"? Why is Dr. Thorn's young daughter locked up in a containment cell? From the top secret labs in the depths of A.R.C.A.N.E.'s headquarters to the distant spires of alien worlds, Ms. Vale will seek answers, solve cryptic puzzles, banish evil otherdimensional creatures, and perhaps even make a new friend over a game of Piggy Princess along the way, in Nightmare Adventures: The Turning Thorn.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9b/b9b96e189b7b39de6031b791c553124a.jpg", "website": "http://www.bigfishgames.com/games/8038/nightmare-adventures-the-turning-thorn/?pc", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 400, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghost Ship Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Big Fish Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
