There are also conveyor belts and several item filters to help you with the logistics.<br/>\r\nWhat makes Assembly Planter special is a feature that allows you to combine a setup of machines into one single machine. This allows you to build infinitely compact. A single well designed machine can create insane amounts of resources.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T15:45:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b64/b6444c663d3fb801a4374ce1f77ec4e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timon Herzog"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Timon Herzog"], "esrb_rating": null}
