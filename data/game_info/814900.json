I can not command you to rate it 5 stars in<strong> every category </strong>but I can try to beg and I can definitely sob.<br/></p>\n<p>P.S.: I\u2019m <strong>sorry for imposing that Windows-only</strong> thing \u2013 I think for the next jam I bite the bullet and upgrade to the HTML5-export tier of GameMaker (or should I go PICO-8 right away? It looks fun for sure). Of course, I myself prefer playing and play-testing the entries that are playable right away in the browser. Downloading some EXE that someone made (especially someone going by the shady name of CLAPOSTROPHE) is some leap-of-faith\u00a0heavy-weight. For everyone (too hesitant) I\u2019d suggest the following:</p>\n<ol><li>Before executing, upload it to the Google sevice VirusTotal. It virus-tests that bugger with dozens and dozens of scanners.</li><li>To be extra-extra safe, execute it in a Sandbox (check Sandboxie, a while ago it turned\u00a0OpenSource).</li></ol>\n<p>All other platform users: sorry to you too.<br/></p>\n<p>THEME\r\n</p>\n<p>Theme of Trijam #176 was \u201cLoading Process.\u201d In this short  game one fights an autonomous loading bar that is occupied with the  tireless creation of missiles to launch into one\u2019s spaceship direction (self  defense, most probably). Further issues arise during combat, given the  circumstance that the bar is directly connected to its \u201chealth\u201d state  and the size of the aforementioned missiles. It may sound weirder in  written from, but it\u2019s actually pretty intuitive when seen.\r\n  </p>\n<p>So yes, we battle a progress bar with feature-creep in space. This is my second game for a game jam and also my second game in total (unfinished text adventures be the exception). I hope it is enjoyed by at least some.<br/></p>\n<p>Now what makes the weekly Trijam so special (beside the weekly part) is this rule: only 3 hours in total for programming, creation of artwork, sounds, etc. Not timely constrained is everything else: gathering ideas, writing a design doc, setting up the page on itch.io and so on.</p>\n<p>3 HOURS RULE<br/></p>\n<p>When I heard about Trijam the first time, I knew I had to try it out. It seemed great at motivating to do the right thing and dive first into a good solid planning phase, and that way un-burden the programming part. It turned out though that I was so curious about my \u201cfighting a progress bar\u201d idea, that soon I  threw together a few lines in Game Maker. And I was so hooked by that simple mechanic I had thought about that a long convoluted messy phase would begin\u2026 were I mostly played the game (or what was at least play-ready) over and over\u2026 added a few lines here and there once in a while, made some cosmeticm changes, and so on. So the planning phase boiled down to applying a few initial scribbles to my notebook, and everything else was a wild ride were everything came together for me impossible to untangle.</p>\n<p>Next time.<br/></p>\n<p>THE SPACESHIP CONTROLS</p>\n<ul><li>Left/Right \u2013 Rotate accordingly</li><li>Top/Bottom \u2013 Accelerate or deaccelerate</li><li>Spacebar \u2013 Shoot a bullet</li></ul>\n<p>DOWNLOAD<br/></p>\n<p>Sorry, for only offering a Windows version. Would have  loved to add a HTML5 version to play in the browser, but my particular  Game Maker Studio subscription doesn\u2019t offer that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T14:42:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cd0d80690b0c4fc3bd464c3774ecf96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clapostrophe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
