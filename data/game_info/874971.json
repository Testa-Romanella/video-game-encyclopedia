Unfortunately, the great artefact was stored away for safe keeping, to prevent it falling into the wrong hands. But to make matters worse the archivists who put it away somewhere safe thought it was a good idea to build a confounding labyrinth to store the pieces of the great artefact. This is no holiday destination. Every step of the way through the labyrinth is designed to kill and leave any budding adventurer confounded. It is Fitzroy's task to recover all the pieces of the artefact, to reassemble the great artefact and repel the darkness.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Fitzroy and the Confounding Labyrinth\u00a0is a top down action\u00a0 game (with plenty of challenges to solve) for the Amstrad CPC and is a 2022 entry for the CPCRetroDev\u00a0game competition.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game has been developed using the amazing\u00a0CPCtelera\u00a0game library.\r\n</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Default controls are as follows (or rebind them to your own preference)\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Left: Move the player left.</li><li>Right: Move the player right.</li><li>Up: Move the player upward.\r\n</li><li>Down: Move the player downward.<br/>\n</li><li>X: (Action) Use an interactive object or shoot the bow or drop a block being carried.</li></ul><p>Shouldn't be too hard but watch out for anything that can kill you. Whether it moves or not it is probably out to get you.</p>\r\nActions\r\n<p>There are several different player actions that have been combined into a single control (this allows for a single button joystick).</p>\n<p>The combined actions are:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Use\r\n  </li><li>Shoot\r\n  </li><li>Drop block\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>If Fitzroy is carrying a block, he will drop the block (if there is a clear space for it in front of him).\r\n  </p>\n<p>If Fitzroy is in front of an interactive object, then it will activate that object.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Otherwise, it fires the weapon (assuming Fitzroy has picked it up and has sufficient ammo).</p>\r\nBlocks\r\n<p>The game includes a droppable block mechanic, this is a block that Fitzroy can carry and drop in the level. Fitzroy cannot shoot or activate an interactive object while carrying a block. He can also only carry a single block at a time.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Move onto the block to pick it up.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you are carrying a block the hud will display a block.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>In order to drop a block there must be an empty space (or something that you are allowed to drop the block onto) in front of Fitzroy. The block will be dropped in front of the direction that Fitzroy is facing but slightly to the left.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nEverything else\r\n<p>If you need any more information or hints look at the user manual, you might be the first person to actually read it!</p>\r\nAuthors and Licenses\r\n<p>This game has been developed by:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Adrian Parker (awergh) - Everything but music\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Additional help has returned\u00a0this year:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Eric Love - Music and testing\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>The game source code has been released under an MIT License.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game was developed with the help of the following software:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>CPCTelera 1.5 (dev) (ronaldo / (Cheesetea, Fremos, ByteRealms))\u00a0- Tool chain and libraries\u00a0building the game for the Amstrad CPC.\r\n</li><li>Retro Game Asset Studio (lachlank)\u00a0- For game graphics\r\n</li><li>Microsoft Visual Studio Code\u00a0and\u00a0Microsoft Visual Studio\u00a0- Text Editor and\u00a0Integrated Development Environment.\r\n</li><li>Arkos Tracker 2\u00a0- Sound and Music\r\n</li><li>Arkos Tracker 2 with CPCtelera\u00a0- Arnaud provided assistance and helpful source files for integrating CPCtelera with Arkos Tracker 2.\r\n</li><li>WinAPE\u00a0(Richard Wilson)\u00a0-\u00a0To run the game I used WinAPE 2.0 Beta 2 and my Amstrad CPC 464.\r\n</li><li>CPCEC\u00a0(cngsoft - Cesar Nicolas-Gonzalez)\u00a0-\u00a0I also used CPCEC for my testing as an alternate emulator and it had a closer matching green to my GT64 than WinAPE.\r\n</li><li>WinCPCTelera (Arnaud)\u00a0-\u00a0In order to leverage the Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger I used WinCPCTelera by Arnaud\r\n</li><li>Allegro 5.2.8\u00a0-\u00a0As part of my development process I created a map editor using Allegro for creating levels.\r\n</li><li>Azure DevOps\u00a0- Every project needs source control, task tracking and continuous integration.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nGesture\r\n<p>Fitzroy and the Confounding Labyrinth includes a\u00a0gesture for Larcena's Legacy in two ways.
