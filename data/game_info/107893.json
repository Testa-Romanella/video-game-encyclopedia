Unfortunately, your Ark isn't quite as big as you told God it would be, and as such you have to be very picky about which animals get on and which don't. Don't let God catch you turning away too many animals at once though, or else he will be very upset with you. Some animals are so desperate to get on the ark that they will even resort to lying.</p>\n<p>Art &amp; Design by Sean Turner</p>\n<p>Programming &amp; Writing by Tyler Martignetti<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f01/f010ccd3826121837cea960ca17ad53a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sean Turner", "Tyler Martignetti"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
