We ended up doing a game about a time travelling football player. Clearly, we have a pattern of choosing very realistic and serious themes.<br/></p>\n<p>While every bit as stressful and frustrating as last time, it was also a fun experience and another great learning opportunity. We were surprised to discover that we could find almost nothing on this clashing\u00a0theme of \"cyberpunk\" meets \"vikings.\" Ridiculous as the game may be, it's a fun aesthetic. The game itself can be a tad challenging but if you're among the ranks who have been playing Elden Ring, this should be a piece of cake.</p>\n<p>Let's see if Ludum Dare 51 happens or whether we'll be waiting for next year.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T18:50:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b0/2b0295db0e0921b01d736d38d5342765.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fc85057"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
