It is an immersive self-discovery experience into the human body. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can manipulate bones, muscles, vessels, organs and other anatomical structures in 3D space. Examine them closely from all angles, read or hear anatomical terminology and study descriptive texts. Delve into the body systems, peek under the skin, and see what you are made of. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n3D Organon VR Anatomy is created for curious minds, medical and allied-health students, healthcare professionals, patients, and educators. With possibility to explore and study more than 4000 realistic anatomical structures and organs, it an engaging educational tool for experiential learning. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe application has been featured in the keynote speech of Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of Facebook, in OC3 conference.
