Now the\u00a0\u00a0monsters have managed to break free and\u00a0are on the loose in your\u00a0facility.\u00a0Fortunately you can use\u00a0your viles that you've\u00a0scattered around the place to craft weapons. To create a weapon, pick up three viles and use them at a factory. You will get different weapons depending on what viles you pick up. Use teleporters around the facility to\u00a0maneuver the enemies and earn as high of a score as you can. The more enemies you defeat at once, the more score you will get. If you want to you can post your highscore in the comments.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move left and right</li><li>Down arrow key to interact (aka pick up viles, use teleporters and craft weapons at the factory)</li><li>Z to shoot</li><li>X to check current viles</li><li>C to use emergency bomb</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:35:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ef/4efb635d9f952a63bf9b3f156a9c4150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DavidTheMe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
