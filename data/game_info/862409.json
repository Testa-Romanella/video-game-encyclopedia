For the best experience, use the downloadable executable if possible.</p>\r\nThe Story\r\n<strong><em>This just in!</em> </strong>A giant swarm of robots is attacking Earth! According to an eyewitness account, they can level an entire city in only ten seconds!\r\nTen seconds? That's all the time in the world! Let's do this!\r\nAbout the Game\r\n<p>In this game, you control a girl who can slow down time. Each wave cleared halves the speed of the world around her. Use this power to destroy the swarm of robots before they can damage the city any further.</p>\n<p>The game was originally created for the LD51 Compo, but due to a lack of time and motivation, it never got finished. Some of the art was created after the original 48 hour period, but the music and all the code was created during the competition. This was the first time I'd ever composed music myself for a game; I hope it doesn't suck lol. I'm not sure if I'll end up revisiting the game later, it really depends on what I feel like.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Palette used: Midnight Ablaze by Inkpendude | https://lospec.com/palette-list/midnight-ablaze</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move<ul><li>Hold Shift to move slower (useful for dodging)</li></ul></li><li>Z to attack</li></ul>\n<p>Controller:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Left Joystick or D-Pad to move<ul><li>Hold L1 move slower</li></ul></li><li>A to attack</li></ul>\n<p>Note - The game has only been confirmed to work with XInput controllers (Any Xbox controller from the 360 onwards, as well as certain third-party controllers).
