A version was later released for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and the Mega Drive. The game takes place on a very difficult otherworldly golf course. It is part of T&amp;E Soft's \"True Golf Classics\" series, but unlike other games in the series which portray actual golf courses such as Pebble Beach and Waialae Country Club, Wicked 18 portrays an entirely fictitious golf course.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18a/18aa92806144885bb4fecd6d42e1b65f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES", "3DO", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Technology and Entertainment Software", "T&E; Soft"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Bullet-Proof Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
