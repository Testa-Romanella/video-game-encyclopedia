Currently zerglings could catch you when you are not sprinting away from them, and orcs could catch you when you trying to simply hit &amp; run. If player has higher speed, orcs may be harmless even with increased amount. To avoid this, both player and enemies' speed must be improved. In that case, zerglings would move too fast. </p><p>So in my opinion it's hard to improve movement speed while keeping it interesting. It would be different if I added more mechanics, enemies and skills in it. </p><p>I've uploaded a alternative version with higher speed.</p><p>Orginal Version:</p><p>Forward Speed : 6 Strafe and Backward Speed : 3 Sprinting Multiplier : 1.5 Hp : 100</p><p>Higher Speed Version:</p><p>Forward Speed : 7 Strafe and Backward Speed : 5 Sprinting Multiplier : 1.8 Hp : 200</p><p>============</p><p>Sorry about my poor English......</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e2/5e21f739e34b47107674f86141948ced.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kitkom"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
