If you'd like, you can always adjust the\u00a0game speed in the options menu if you don't like waiting. That said, the web version\u00a0seems to have issues running when the game screen is not visible.\u00a0This is related to some web browsers putting the tab to sleep. If anyone knows how to\u00a0fix this in Unity, let me know! :)</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Babies will over eat and get an upset stomach.</li><li>Babies won't have enough energy if they are awoken from sleeping.</li><li>Babies don't like to train.</li><li>To grow up, a baby must have a full nutrition bar</li><li>To become a hero, your alien must spend as much time as possible training.</li><li>Each of the Training activities requires specific resources</li><li>Each food provides bonuses to Nutrition, Saturation, Strength, Speed, and Intelligence</li><li>A hero in training will only recover energy if they are saturate</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T05:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57b/57b14c444b1b0e738c1a3c12846780e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["jocolloman"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
