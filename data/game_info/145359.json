Simply use A and D for left and right. Space bar to shoot.</p><p>I may, at a later date add the destructible buildings (like the original) and a high score table, but this game is essentially finished (sounds are also a future possibility). </p><p>NOTE: As with all C++ games written with Visual Studio, you may need to download the re-distributables from the Microsoft website to run this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a16/a1669ea20149ea55c7096697c46666cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhilXIVII"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
