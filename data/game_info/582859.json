{"id": 582859, "slug": "sudoku-play-time", "name": "Sudoku - Play Time", "name_original": "Sudoku - Play Time", "description": "<p>Sudoku (originally called Number Place) is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9\u00d79 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3\u00d73 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", or \"regions\") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. Completed games are always an example of a Latin square, including an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column, or any of the nine 3\u00d73 subregions of the 9\u00d79 playing board.
