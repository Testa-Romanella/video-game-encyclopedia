The creative approach is woven directly into the<br />\ngame play and allows the ever-morphing Kirby to take on a variety of new<br />\nforms. A simultaneous two player* mode will have players of all skill<br />\nlevels enjoying this one-of-a-kind experience.</p>\n<p>The look of the world is stunning, but it&#39;s also interactive. Pulling<br />\non stray threads might reveal hidden areas. When Kirby literally goes<br />\nbehind the scenes, the virtual fabric warps and bends to show his<br />\nlocation.</p>\n<p>Thanks to his versatile yarn composition, Kirby can take on a variety<br />\nof forms both in his common actions and when he transforms into<br />\npowerful vehicles. When Kirby dashes, he zips around as a car. In<br />\nwater, he turns into a submarine. At times he can even transform into<br />\na massive robotic tank, a UFO and other vehicles.</p>\n<p>Two players can play through the entire game together.</p>\n<p>Beads and collectible items are scattered throughout the environments<br />\nfor players to find.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2010-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T14:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbc/cbc476a2a00b82853bc30b32d46edcab.jpg", "website": "http://www.kirbykirbykirby.com/", "rating": 3.99, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 16, "owned": 30, "beaten": 60, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 26, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 66, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 19, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": ["Good-Feel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
