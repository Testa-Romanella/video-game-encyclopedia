How did she get there, how can she escape and most importantly why was she brought there?</em></p>\n<p>This game was made as an experiment in Amiga CD32 development and will need to either be burned to CD-R to be played on a real machine or used with an Amiga emulator with CD32 BIOS ROMs. If you're trying to use a standard Amiga you will need a game pad with 2 buttons.</p>\n<p>I developed this using AMOS Professional, which is simple game dev software for the Amiga. Though it's targeted at beginner it was quite capable and a lot of fun to work with.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>D-Pad - Move</li><li>Button 1 - Look</li><li>Button 2 - Interact</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T14:04:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4b/e4b109f15ad5e919a9ecb4cf42347719.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Locked Door Puzzle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
