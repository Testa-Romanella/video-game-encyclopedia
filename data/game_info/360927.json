It is a submission for the annual Game Makers Toolkit Jam and most of the assets are handdrawn. The game is inspired by a board game I played as a kid, that's the reason why I chose this hand-drawn style.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You control a group of Shadow Fairies. Each turn you can sneakily move behind the trees. When a fairy is struck by the light, she freezes and must wait until she is rescued by another fairy. Once all fairies gather together under a tree you complete the scene.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Left Mouse: Select<br/>Right Mouse: Deselect<br/>Middle Mouse: Rotate<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce7/ce778a5f10abd91df41618aae910d70a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Farry1"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
