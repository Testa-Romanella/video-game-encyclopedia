The game will give musicians the opportunity to embark on a journey of musical exploration while they explore their own culture and musical artistic influences.<br/>\nAs musicians embark on these journeys, they'll be able to discover the origins and experiences of the composer connected to those instruments, the themes and images of some of those instruments, feelings of nostalgia and aspirations of others.\n\nFrom the composer's journey to the musician's quest and the orchestra's journey together, you'll hear and experience the rewards of having been there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:22:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e0b8527372a23702178bde483d46fc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
