On your way you encounter enemies (which you either avoid or fight if you have found a weapon), treasure chests, and other elements that make every level a unique challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>When entering a level, you can move the cursor with the D-Pad and shift tiles that are in the same row or column as the cursor by pressing either A (shift down), B (shift right), X (shift left) or Y (shift down). When you have created a path to the goal, you can press START to send your character in his way. Once he starts running, you can only watch how the events unfold (unless there's a crossroad, in which case you can choose a direction). If the character reaches the goal, the level is finished. If not, you can try again.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>GameShell<br/></p>\r\nKey\u00a0/\u00a0ButtonGameShellWindowsMove Cursor<br/>D-Pad<br/>Arrow Keys<br/>Shift Tiles<br/>ABXYWASDMove Player<br/>START button<br/>EnterAcceptA button<br/>S<br/>BackB button<br/>DPauseSELECT button<br/>SpaceQuit Game<br/>MENU button<br/>Escape\r\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, Design - Constantin Graf<br/>Art - Jussi Simpanen<br/>Music - Andr\u00e9 Wei\u00df<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T05:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d6/9d6051c6da3e24acf6da40b04c15a75e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Rebusmind"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
