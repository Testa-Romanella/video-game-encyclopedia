{"id": 19926, "slug": "hauntsters", "name": "Hauntsters", "name_original": "Hauntsters", "description": "Hauntsters is a 2D battle game in which up to 4 players compete for victory in a spooky arena. Each player chooses their character from a selection of 12 supernatural entities, using their unique abilities and combos to win the fight. Compete in a chaotic free-for-all or team up with a friend for a combo-centric 2 v 2 team battle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHauntsters is currently a local multiplayer game only.  If the project reaches a number of sales that allow us to hire the appropriate staff, we will retro fit the project with additional characters, stages, and of course, online multiplayer options.  All future updates for Hauntsters will be available for free to those who have purchased the game.  We believe in free DLC and additional content for the people who support us, if we can financially manage it.  Thank you and enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:05:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb303e9d100c307893fb3de67b6ae68.jpg", "website": "http://www.sharktreestudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 16}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shark Tree Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shark Tree Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
