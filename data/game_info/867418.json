I designed this simple educational counting game to encourage his learning from as early an age as possible, I want to give him all the head starts and advantages I can. Our children deserve the best chance in life possible, and a good early education is a key factor in them getting it.</p>\n<p>This is a simple educational counting game where you play as a squirrel trying to catch numbered acorns in ascending order, starting from 1 going all the way to 100. With encouraging messages, happy/cute visuals and a simple to use control scheme, playing through this game with your children is sure to help them reach the counting to 100 milestone in no time!</p>\n<p>Acorn Academy - Catch &amp; Count is the first installment in a planned series of games, following installments will cover new subjects such as addition &amp; subtraction, times tables, simple spelling, advanced spelling and many more. I want to make a clean and effective educational game collection that is available to as many people as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Donations are very welcome, <strong>but please only give what you can afford</strong>. Proceeds will go towards improved software &amp; hardware, this will allow me to create larger and more in DPTH games for the series. The most important thing is that our children have access to the tools they may need to thrive.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to try my game</p>\n<p>Freddie Hughes\u00a0 - TA: Games in DPTH<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>CREDITS\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Designed, developed, produced &amp; published</strong> by Freddie Hughes\u00a0 - TA: Games in DPTH\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Woodland Background:</strong> https://opengameart.org/content/sideview-fantasy-patreon-collection\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Squirrel Sprite &amp; Graphics:</strong> http://kyrodianlegends.com/license &amp; http://foxboy83.com\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Acorn Graphics:</strong> Art from https://GameArtGuppy.com  <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T14:32:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ecde261d66f9056f80d642314c359b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Games in DPTH"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
