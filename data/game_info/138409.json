It is based on the theme of running out of space. The game is a 2D platformer and my inspiration for making this game came from several classical DS games. The game may be a little buggy as it is only the 2nd platformer I made. Some may cringe at the animation and art style but hey give me credit at least I tried. :) \u00a0Anyway hope you enjoy the game and thanks for checking it out. Have fun! ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27c/27ccf3d6e8dd2db8640771d86f9dcfbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkippyNose2"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
