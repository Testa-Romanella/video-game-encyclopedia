It's a little casual game where you need to survive in a chess board as a pawn who can only move one or two squares or stay still. The rest of the pieces in the board (Bishops, Knights and Rooks) will try to capture you. Your objetive is to advance as much squares as you can without die.</p>\n<p>All the game can be played with two buttons, 'Q' and 'W' (even the menus). There is no music or sound yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Attributions</p>\n<p>Chess Pieces 3d models by Luke Brown -&gt;\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/chess-kit-94f58cabfc0044acb83c28f5b70c79f9<br/></p><p>Text font -&gt;\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/good-times-font.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T03:32:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64d657373c97d39fc01759ec3c5e384b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ferdelmo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
