Try it!</p>\n<p>Ever wondered what would playing rougelike be like in a dynamic way? Wonder no more! PaceLite is an arena-rougelite game where every move gets performed with the music\u00a0beats giving it a thrill of emotion every move you make. I hope you can make decisions FAST! All that in a heavy dark-fantasy climat with atmospheric homemade music.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You don't need to be a musician, it's not a musical game. It just uses the music and beats for the pacing! No penalties if you cannot hit\u00a0the beat.</p>\n<p>PS.
