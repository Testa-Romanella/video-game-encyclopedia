I went into this project with no central idea, so there is no plot, just a stream of writing. Let me know if there are any issues with the game such as typos, grammar, or function. This was a great experience, I thank all the people who hosted this jam and Lysander for the Twine advice, check out his Twine games! Thanks you all. </p><p>Twine games from the 1.4 engine do not work in Google Chrome so you're going to have to use it on Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07f/07f6d3621770f16def413606986dd869.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["XianXian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
