Other than the name change, the game has received several new features, GUI enhancements, and miscellaneous polish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the concept is simple, the gameplay is anything but. Your hyper-drive thrusters can only be activated every couple seconds (indicated by your handy-dandy DASH indicator), using the thrusters will send your ship flying into the nearby walls, or slow your acceleration for precise dodging and shooting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every consecutive hit will add to your COMBO meter, which lets you rack up bonus points. Once the meter is full (after ~10 shots without missing) , your health will be filled up.</p>\n<p>After a number of waves, you will \"Level Up\" which doubles the amount of damage taken and takes your maximum health down by 20%.</p>\n<p>Your high score will be saved to a text file in the game's\u00a0directory. My personal best is the default value.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b169e212810f46588bf3f66ea5a3876c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carter15"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
