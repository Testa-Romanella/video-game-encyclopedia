You can even locally compete with friends by trying to beat eacothers local highscores!</p>\n<p>Another feature is to build your own levels. The level editor allows you to create and test your own levels. Afterwards you can find and play your created levels at\u00a0the bottom of the level selection screen .</p>\n<p>As\u00a0 this was a student project we can not guarantee further updates or patches for this game, although we do intend to improve it when we find the time. So feel free to report any bugs or problems you find!\u00a0With a little bit of luck we will be able to support Hackout.</p>\n<p>Without further ado....go play the game!</p>\n\n<p>Not Quite Interactive:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Caleb Leon Robin Garnatz - Artist</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0James Edward Ferreira Monteiro - Programmer (Gameplay, UI)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Janik Nissen - Programmer (Level Editor, Tools, UI)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lukas Roloff - Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:35:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6d/a6d501348ebcb190fbe304326ed81957.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LukeSolas", "JanoschExe"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
