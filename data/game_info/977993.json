The action takes place during World War 2 in the Pacific.<br/><br/>You will fly one of the six different aircraft available against the Japanese.<br/>You will be dog fighting against Zeros, Ki43, Ki49, G4M, G4M2, Hk8K2, Nakajima Kikka, J8M Shusui, and Shinden.<br/><br/>Choose between 5 missions:<br/>- Atoll<br/>- Pearl Harbor<br/>- Wake Island<br/>- Japan Run<br/>- Ha Long Bay<br/><br/>You can play them in the order you want without restriction. The goal is to obtain the highest score in every mission. When you or one of your Allies destroys a plane, you gain a flag. When you have 3 flags, you gain an Ace level. The mission ends at Ace 100, if you are still alive. When you destroy an enemy, you get a Power UP, at Ace 100 you get an Upgrade.<br/><br/>All missions start with you and a wingman against 3 Japanese and when you gain an Ace Level, the number of enemies increase as well as the number of Allies, but the numbers are random, sometimes you get more Allies, sometimes it's the opposite.<br/><br/>Backgrounds are very detailed all in 4K HD. Atoll is a small map, Wake Island is a giant one 32768x30720 pixels. The effect is stunning and if you're like me, you will want to go swimming on that beach.<br/><br/>All the objects are 3D, even the sea. <br/>I recommend you use a game controller. It's like flying a small RC aircraft on your screen. But it also works with a keyboard.<br/><br/>I am planning to add more missions if the reviews are good. If you like it, give it a thumbs up.<br/>Hubert", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T10:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4b/e4b63ce968b9f5f038f885bf915e6ad7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hubert Cachat"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HC"], "esrb_rating": null}
