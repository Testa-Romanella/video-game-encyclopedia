It contains 155 levels and was released in April 2000.</p>\n<p>Here are\u00a0Microban II,\u00a0Microban III and\u00a0Microban IV.</p>\n<p>Mobile-friendly version/source code:\u00a0https://auroriax.github.io/PuzzleScript/play.html?p=dcbd9ff6eff2d1d352a982cdf0bc...</p>\n<p>If a puzzle doesn't display properly, use the fullscreen or the link above. You might need to zoom-in/out sometimes to get consistant sizes. Also, some puzzles are simply too big to be displayed on mobile, I'm sorry about that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Goal: Put every yellow circle on one of the targets.<br/></p>\n<p>- Arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>- Z to undo</p>\n<p>- R to restart</p>\n<p>- ESC to access the level select</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's Microban?</strong></p>\n<p><em>The\u00a0Microban collection is good for beginners and children. Most of the puzzles are small and illustrate a particular concept.\u00a0More experienced players should also find them interesting, since there is a wide variety and many can be surprisingly tricky at first glance.<br/>Microban sets\u00a0contain levels of the following types:<br/>1. Small levels which demonstrate one or two concepts.<br/>2. Levels which are easier than most Sasquatch levels.<br/>3. Levels which are smaller and simpler versions of other levels.<br/>4. Large levels which contain only one object. Use the mouse to place the object on its destination, then sit back and watch the computer do all the work. These are I-154, I-155, II-132, II-133, II-134, II-135, III-101, IV-101, IV-102.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>(Taken from D.
