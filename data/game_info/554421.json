Four days after i started the project, the FFS GameJam opened up and i submited to it with the project.</strong></p>\n<p>Its actually a prototype, there are 2 levels and a boss fight. It's a hard game, requires some training to get to the boss and killing it. So if you are into hard games, i think you should try it out.</p><p>A sample of the gameplay:</p><br/>\n<p><strong>---I Highly recommend the desktop downloadable version---</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have built a WebGL version to easier showcase for the GameJam, but somethings, UI mostly is a little weird.</p>\n\n<p>You basically kill stuff, stack critical chance, dash through enemies to avoid damage.</p>\n<p><strong>The game was made during a 34 days period.\u00a0 This game is my first finished game, i've wrote every single line of code from scratch, drawn and animated all the assets.</strong></p>\n<p>If you liked, follow me on my twitter to see recent updates and projects</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/BodeDev</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>-Move -- A and D</p>\n<p>-Dash/Dodge -- Left-Shift or Left-Control (Invulnerable while dashing) - CORE MECHANIC</p>\n<p>-Shoot -- Left or Right Mouse Button<br/>-Aim -- Mouse Pointer sets which side you shoot(not the directional keys)<br/>-Jump -- Space<br/>-Grenade -- G<br/>-Drop Down Platforms -- S</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>- Every third shot is a critical shot, unless you get hit, this will reset the counter.<br/>- Every landed crit gives you 10 CP, you gain +10% critical chance every 100 CP<br/>- You loose all your CP and the critical chance acumulated if you get hit<br/>- Your grenades costs 30 Resources to throw<br/>- Critical Multiplier and Maximum Resources can be upgraded with pickups<br/>- Every critical hit landed restores 5 resources.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T09:41:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8e/e8e0334b0fce654f25aa6a93637d9106.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["PriniBR"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
