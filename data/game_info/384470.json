By default the primitives are destroyed in 3 seconds, but the user can toggle it on or off, or clear the entire canvas through the user interface. In addition, the user can randomize color and scale of the primitive shapes, and choose the distance from the screen to spawn the primitives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T06:57:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd3/cd3e01f90381d2ccff6908920cfc73bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Harshil Shah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
