See changelog for more details.<br/></p>\n<p>I've added a player controlled \"Hero\" to the game. Not sure yet how I feel about the addition; try it out and let me know what you think. Is it worthwhile or should we just be playing cards?<br/></p>\n<p>--------<br/></p>\n<p>This is a turn-based, deck-building, \"tower\" defense game. If any of that sounds interesting to you, please give the game a try! For Windows only. Just download, unzip, and run \"TDDeckbuilder.exe\"\r\n</p>\n<p>It's early days yet in development and there is much to do. There is NO custom art (if anyone knows a modeler/animator/artist that might be interested in teaming up, let me know!) or music/sound effects, I might look at purchasing some assets down the line.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to try this out! Comments and ideas welcome!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T00:59:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d6/7d6736137293e0001376a593874fa423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["phuoclam24"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
