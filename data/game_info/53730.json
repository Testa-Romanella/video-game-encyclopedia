While it was never released in the arcade, two versions of the game were developed independently from each other (for the NES and Game Boy formats), with each game receiving a different story line as a result. The Game Boy version is known in Japan as Bubble Bobble Junior (\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30dc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b8\u30e5\u30cb\u30a2).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cf/7cfa1f3c880a9e5c7703fa426096e980.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["NES", "Game Boy"], "developers": ["Taito", "ITL Co."], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Taito America"], "esrb_rating": null}
