I have included the original upload description below.</p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>\"Gwen's Desperate Day is a game that I originally created for a game jam on 4chan. The theme of the jam was \"bad luck,\" which of course is something that is very present in omorashi situations and the time limit for game creation was only two weeks. The game is a little rough around the edges in spots, but it's basic and it works. I am also uploading the version that I uploaded for the jam, so it is presented \"as-is.\" There are four different endings to reach, so try and find them all!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The reason I chose to do this jam and with this situation is that I wanted to practice sprite art, so I took the RTP character and put her in a few different desperation and peeing poses. If you don't want to play the game, you can find it in the \"other stuff\" folder.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Even though this was only a small practice game, I hope you enjoy it!\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T07:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf5/cf5a03944892652b038b22c557b2d62c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CaNat Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
