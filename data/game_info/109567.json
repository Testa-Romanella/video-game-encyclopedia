This week, I sat in a room with some students doing a game jam and started doing tutorials. I had no idea for an actual game, but just wanted to play around. Then, on the second game, I had the idea of turning the process of learning Unity into my game for the jam. </p><p>This hit the theme words of 'roam', 'flaws', and 'the letter L'. </p><p>So this game is not a good game. It's not even really a designed game at all. It's a bunch of bits and pieces stuck together solely for the purpose of learning how those pieces stick together. I thought of it as a sort of 'Beginner's Guide Like'. Just me talking through my own process as I make stuff. </p><p>Credits:<br/>Fade Screen In/Out Script<br/>This streetlamp from the Asset Store</p><p>Thanks to all the students and fellow lecturers who helped me figure out Unity stuff. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fc/0fc42651c85fe366a1ead28f89ed3348.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
