{"id": 317768, "slug": "noccultic", "name": "Noccultic", "name_original": "Noccultic", "description": "<p>: Noccultic is a short game in which you're tasked with escaping cursed dungeons. Your character is equipped with a lantern and a cursed coin. If the player tosses the coin into the air, the faces rapidly change. Each face represents a particular power that the coin has access to. When the coin is flipped to the other side, the current\u00a0power will be released into the player. This power may be a blessing, but on the other side,\u00a0it may also be a curse.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal is to deplete the cursed energy of every altar within the area. There is an introduction level explaining these mechanics, but they will be listed here as well.<br/>To deplete an altar, you must:<br/>\u2022 Have a coin equipped.<br/>\u2022 Have less than the maximum (3) charges remaining in your coin.<br/>\u2022 Not be in the cursed realm.<br/></p><p><em>Note: you can easily distinguish between cursed and cleansed altars by their colour. Purple altars are cursed.\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> You can watch the entirety of this game's development on my\u00a0\u00a0twitch channel.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T07:21:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a7/2a772a5257949ff9b670781beda56050.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TylerCowan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
