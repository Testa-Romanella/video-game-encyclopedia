The more <br/>health you got the harder it is to move around. On the other hand, if <br/>your health is low you can move fast as a bullet, but can easily die if <br/>you make a mistake. Luckily the same goes for the monsters around, you <br/>can transfer your health to them shooting health bullets that deplete <br/>from your own health to make them slower (and you faster). Then dash and<br/> slice them up to deal damage and take some health back.</p>\n<p>The game goes with LD40 theme \"The more you have, the worse it is\" and is<br/> designed to make you want to play just one more time to try to beat the<br/> game. (It's a bit hard to get it going though)<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>[WASD] Move</p>\n<p>[Mouse 0] Dash</p>\n<p>[Mouse 1] Shoot<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3c/a3c599171c0717c30d1c213b8ecef3cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["lex-m"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
