Be warned though: the more you mess with a game tape, the more erratic the obstacles will become, stretching and sliding all over the playing field!</p>\n<p>You have up to three other\u00a0colour-coded game tape 'Back-Ups' in a little box to your right\u00a0that you can swap between where necessary,\u00a0whenever the current tape\u00a0has become too warped for you to play with; just click 'Pause' on the tape deck with your mouse, click on\u00a0another tape to swap with\u00a0and click 'Play' to get going again! Collide with an obstacle in the game and you lose the currently used tape. Gain enough points and you can even win back a precious tape in brand spanking new condition, or even a pencil to save your current tape\u00a0from one further obstacle hit.</p>\n<p>AZIMUTH\u00a0hearkens back to the days of the\u00a0Apple Macintosh II and\u00a0Commodore cassette game systems with dexterous controls,\u00a0satisfyingly clunky mechanical sound design and a retro sci-fi\u00a0style so war and soft that practically melts through the monitor and glows\u00a0around the screen!</p><p>REMEMBER: High scores will only be saved after a game over; don't quit in the middle of a run if you're serious about going for the gold! To quit the game, press the power button next to the glowing red light\u00a0to the right-hand side of\u00a0the in-game computer. Keep your wits about you, because if you lose all your tapes,\u00a0it's game over!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T07:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c4015cd748e676802995cd575fad1b93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Bonsai Treehouse"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
