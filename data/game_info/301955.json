There are no plans to continue development.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:27:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27d/27d64b5f75aec8b94b171ca3fa59d5a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bohrium"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
