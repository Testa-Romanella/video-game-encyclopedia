You probably know a few of them. Gemini is a fun chance to prove that you're a great multitasker, way better than your boastful friend or that annoying coworker. And if you aren't great yet, it's your opportunity to practice and become one.<br/><br/>Gemini is a racing game that features not one but two simultaneous courses. The rules of Gemini are simple: don't crash in either lane. The longer you last, the more points you get. If you have the time to spare, you can maneuver to other lanes to collect coins that boost your point multiplier, allowing you to potentially get more points even if you die earlier.<br/><br/>Hardcore multitaskers who want to prove their mettle should start with classic mode, where only you and your skill can keep you alive from second to second. More casual players who want to relax while still being challenged can play arcade mode, where you can collect coins to purchase upgrades in between races that start off at a more gentle pace.<br/><br/>Feel free to contact us about any questions, bugs, or feedback at play.shinji.games@gmail.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/088/088ef49a2cd831a690054013fc3b1ea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShinjiGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
