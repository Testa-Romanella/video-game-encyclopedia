(only put into full screen once the game is loaded so it can resize)\r\n<p>Achuluophobia is the fear of darkness. When it's dark, you cannot tell what is there, so anything could be there, maybe even monsters.</p>\r\nThe power just went out. You cannot see anything, your mind starts going crazy. Now what are those things in front of you? Are they monsters. When I shine the light they are just toys.\r\n<p>In this game, use your flashlight to reveal what the monsters really are. <strong>BUT</strong>, the battery only has a limited battery, make sure to go recharge it. Remember though, the power is out, so to charge that you must use a hand crank.</p>\n<p>Move with WASD or arrows, and jump with W or Space. To put the flashlight on the charger press e, and to crank the generator hold e. Make sure to shine the light on any monster to reveal the normal room.</p>\n<p>Note: the green that appears for the flashlight is showing the normal room. The grey room is the \"nightmare\" world from you being afraid of the dark.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33a/33a687edb748407b7239c6b99ca9c3af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ajay"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
