{"id": 45828, "slug": "ravager", "name": "Ravager", "name_original": "Ravager", "description": "<strong>We all know the story: hero emerges from humble beginnings, slays the tyrannical dragon, and ushers in a new era of peace and prosperity.</strong><br/><br/><strong>But here, it's the other way around.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Ravager</strong> is a game where you play a young dragon, determined to reclaim their birthright. To do so, you will need to build your power, ally with dark forces, evade justice, and whet your monstrous appetites.<br/><br/><strong>FOLLOW THE VILLAIN'S JOURNEY</strong><br/><br/>Explore your way through a dark fantasy saga that will lead you into the deepest reaches of the world, where you may build your lair. Combine forces with the half-human tribes, opportunistic mercenaries, and stranger powers - like long-forgotten gods, or conniving infernals. Return on the warpath, conquer the lands, and depose the regent who rules in your stead. Forge your kingdom into the shape you want, and reap the benefits of power.<br/><br/><strong>FIND YOUR OWN PATH</strong><br/><br/>Choose to tackle your challenges through strength or cunning, respect or fear. There are no simplistic morality systems at work here, and you will not be punished for thinking outside of the box. Be magnanimous or tyrannical, honourable or devious, gracious or predatory - and feel free to combine those approaches as your heart and mind see fit.<br/><br/><strong>BUILD YOUR HAREM</strong><br/><br/>Ravager has a voice-acted cast of dozens, each with their own motivations and inclinations. You'll meet eager supporters, allies of convenience, and deadly foes. Follow their ascent (or descent) under your influence, and decide their fate. Perhaps you might even find love along the way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T18:30:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/909/90937b7a39468e7d8cfd7dd5692b8fa9.jpg", "website": "http://www.indiedb.com/games/ravager", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 57, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 80, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ariflare", "Nikhil Tailor", "4MinuteWarning"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Horse Beverages", "4MinuteWarning"], "esrb_rating": null}
