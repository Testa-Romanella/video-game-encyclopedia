This has Bulbo worried - their friend, Robo, keeps the power plant running and the city alight. Their concern prompts them to traverse through the dangers of the power plant to ensure their friend's safety and to ensure the power plant is operational once again. Due to the dangers, it will come \"down to the wire\" arms upon their body to be able to get Bulbo to his friend.<br/><br/>Bulbo is a game made for the first StraightUpGameJam hosted by StraightUpGruntled on Twitch, and it is a platformer game where you jump up to use Bulbo's two wire arms (one red, one blue) to\u00a0grab onto and swing on like-colored hookups throughout the levels.\u00a0<br/><br/>All components and assets present in this game and the programming were done by me (except for the font - the font is \"Pixel Cowboy\"\u00a0and can be found\u00a0\u00a0here).<br/><br/>___________________________________________________<br/><br/>KNOWN BUGS\u00a0</p><p>*\u00a0Sometimes, if you click too fast to grapple, the game will lock and you will need to go into the pause menu (P) and select \"Quit.\" This will take you back to the main title page.
