This is based on the idea that a pawn wants to make it to the opposite rank of the chess board so it can promote.\u00a0The idea was that once the level was\u00a0completed it would invert (as if you\u00a0were then playing the level from the other side of the chess board as the opposite color). Sadly, I ran into some last minute issues and now the check for level completion is broken. :(\u00a0 As such, you can only play the levels as the white pawn and you can never win.\u00a0</p><p>Assets:</p><p>I made them all my myself! Woo Hoo!
