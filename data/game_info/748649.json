You are playing an oppressed dog named \u201cChips\u201d. He grew up in the slums and recently joined a rebellion group in order to take back the city and end the cats\u2019 tyranny once and for all. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In order to defeat the cats, you will have to save other animals who are captive to their rule.
