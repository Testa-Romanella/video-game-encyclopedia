However, you are not alone here. The animatronics in the restaurant that you are watching over, are somewhat... alive, and will try to make their way to your office. However, you can watch over them via the monitor screen, and if they should ever come too close, you can close the office doors in their face. They get more active as the week progresses, so watch out! Oh, and try and keep the power from running out, bad things will happen if this occurs!</p>\n\n<p>Foxy, pirate cove, Golden Freddy and other elements of the original game\u00a0are not included in this remix! They may come in a future update, but this is not guaranteed! All assets are from the original game files, created by the master - Scott Cawthon.</p>\n<p>Saving your game is possible. This happens whenever you progress to the next night. There is a special reward if you manage to complete all 5 nights! You can delete all saved data by pressing the delete key while on the main menu. Controls are stated within the main menu also. Although this remake does not have some of the original game's elements, the core game play is still there, and there is no loss in the horror or excitement of being trapped in this seemingly wonderful pizzeria!</p><p>Why is this game not playable in the browser?</p><p>One of the most important element of FNaF is being able to save your game. Without it, all of your progress will be for nothing. This needs to be done via the local storage within the <strong>player's</strong> computer. So that is why you need to download this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T09:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c5dc66c0ebdd5470151b34a4b25d0da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cram9io"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
