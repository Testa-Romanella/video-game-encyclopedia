However, this quarrel brought with it a perpetual night to this world. \r\n</p>\n<p>After several battles, the villages became the battle field. One of those villages being our protagonist\u2019s home. Now, after losing everything, he must face the horrors of the night while seeking a new home. \r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed Outline</strong>\n</p>\n<p>After the council of the great five nations, humanity decided to go to war against the God of death, since he was a despotious God that fell into madness after his lover, the lust God was killed. He was killed by the other Gods, but they make it look as if humanity did the killing. After engaging, the Huge war started, killing millions and destroying big amounts of villages. \r\n</p>\n<p>One of those villages was our main character\u2019s. He is not a warrior, but a gatherer, but now he must embark on a new unexpected adventure that will define the future of Okur-Ton. His first challenge will be crossing the dark forest, an old graveyard of fallen warriors that was sealed to avoid the vessels of darkness from escaping. Now the only way out is building a ladder to cross the northern wall and reach a safe haven known as Borselol, the city of the demi Goddess Lucilla. \r\n</p>\n<p>The dark forest prevents any light from entering, making it some of the most dangerous places to be unarmed and alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets Needed</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Main character</strong><ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/chadmandoos-random-2d-rpg-characters-animations-larger-characters\r\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Terrain/Environment\r\n</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Map</strong><ul><li>Pixel Art Top Down - Basic - Unity Store\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><strong>Apples</strong><ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/apple<br/>\n</li></ul></li><li><strong>UI Tutorial controls<br/></strong><ul><li>https://icons8.com/icon/58041/shift-mac\r\n</li><li>https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/wasd\r\n</li><li>https://github.com/maucamsan/SecondGameJamGeneration.git</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><p>Music</p><ul><li>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q4HHeK8Ou2o<br/>\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/szegvari/sounds/577789/\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>SFX<ul><li>Sound In Player #1<ul><li>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=brnoh7Hq8mw</li></ul></li><li>Sound In Enemy #2\r\n<ul><li>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sbxFswI8fVU</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T16:11:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d0/3d07287b546bc44b450f05b446fef2b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mauricio Camargo Santos", "DialfesGD", "Hessler", "Yess02"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
