{"id": 970088, "slug": "forest-of-math", "name": "Forest of MATH", "name_original": "Forest of MATH", "description": "This is a game I made for my 8-year old who loves games, but doesn't like to practice math. In the game, the damage dealt to enemies is a result of calculations. This means that results which are harder to compute are more beneficial to the gameplay. I was surprised that he would estimate and compute hard ones first, because it meant beating the enemies in style.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li> explore the forest<br/></li><li> fight monsters in turn-based combat<br/></li><li> cast mathemagic spells<br/></li><li> compute damage with addition and subtraction up to 200, and multiplication up to 100<br/></li><li> find map scrolls to help you navigate the maze, or health upgrades to beat bosses<br/></li><li> collect magic digits to build your numeric spells</li></ul><h3>Is it hard?</h3><br/><ul><li> In the early game the enemies are weaker, and there's more room for error. <br/></li><li> Later enemies have more HP and hit harder, but the player can still win with a couple of errors. Sometimes the battles can be won quickly, if the player gets lucky with digits chosen for calculations. For example, 98+98 does massive damage.<br/></li><li> Bosses require precise computation. Even then, make sure you collect most of the health upgrades before attacking.</li></ul><h3>What's the Forest like?</h3><br/><ul><li> The map is procedurally a generated maze - different every time you start a new game. <br/></li><li> Monster and treasure placement is also randomised.<br/></li><li> Sometimes you might get map upgrades at the very start, another time you might get health upgrades instead.<br/></li><li> Order in which you gain the digits is also random. You might start with something easy as 2 and 6, and doing math like 26+2 or 62-2. Or you might get 8 or 9 quickly, which is more challenging, for example to compute: 83-38.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T01:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df6/df6e663f2c4bebe8afe8d7930a302baf.jpg", "website": "http://guacosoft.com/math", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Agencija SQL"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Agencija SQL"], "esrb_rating": null}
