If no tiles are lit purple, you are not in attacking range of any enemies. Also, remember to hit the \"End Turn\" button when you're finished with your turn.</strong></p><p>The court jester has been caught faking tricks in the castle parlor. Using his magic dice and cards, he must take his chances and face off against the defenders of the throne. Will the odds be in his favor? Or does this house always win?</p>\n\r\nCHARACTERS\r\n<p><strong>THE JESTER</strong></p>\r\n\r\nAs the chosen entertainer of the Royal Family, the Jester has stealthily used his position to swindle more and more wealth from the Court through rigged gambles, sleight of hand, and simple theft. Having finally been caught, he'll have to be smart - and lucky - to get out of this one.<br/>\n<p><strong>THE KING</strong><br/></p>\n\r\nEven those closest to the King fear his wrath, and the Jester has  just found himself on the receiving end of it. With his large frame and vengeful nature in the face of betrayal, the King is dangerous and unpredictable.\r\n\n<p><strong>THE QUEEN</strong><br/></p>\n\r\nThough her husband officially runs this court, the Queen holds the real power. She's cunning enough to stay out of fights she can't win, and strike when the moment is right.\r\n\n<p><strong>JACK<br/></strong></p>\n\r\nA nobleman and trusted counselor to the court, Jack is a textbook brown-noser. He has long felt threatened by the Jester's high status and good reputation. Likewise, he is thrilled to see the court turn against you and would love to deliver the final blow.\r\n\n<p><strong>THE KNIGHT OF DIAMONDS</strong></p>\n\r\nOnly select knights join the Diamond ranks. They are the most loyal, strong, and experienced soldiers in the King's Army, serving as the personal guardians of the King and Queen. Being a Knight of Diamonds is all about loyalty and trust, and will not hesitate to kill the Jester and restore order for the Court.<br/>\n<p>\n<strong>BIG BUMBA<br/></strong></p>\nNo one knows exactly what Big Bumba is, though his simple-mindedness and animal-like behavior mimics that of the King's pet. He's doesn't particularly care much about your crimes, instead more interested in the loot lying around the castle. But get too close or take his loot...and may God have mercy on your soul.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T19:18:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37e/37e6adea448b23c1d46237c208e21eca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaxMitchell", "AstronotCB", "coreyshayman", "Max!"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
