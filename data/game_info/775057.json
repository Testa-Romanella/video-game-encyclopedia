I decided to write it down in my notebook. Unfortunately when I woke up, it was the notebook in my dream, not my real idea notebook. On Saturday morning, April 23, I hurried to make a small drawing of the idea, it was still somewhere in my mind. I gave myself 2 days to make a mini game of it, here is the result.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play ?</strong></p>\n<p>Use the left and right arrows of the keyboard to move, the top arrow is used to jump. The goal is to reach the last platform (the one with the yellow arrow on top), but each platform changes the size of the game screen ! Good luck ^^</p>\n<p>This mini game has only three levels, I still have a lot of ideas, it's possible that I'll add more levels in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>The music of the game is from Xylo-Ziko. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T07:16:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ce/4cee1ba39293b2fb1dd0a8697dd5b4ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nicolas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
