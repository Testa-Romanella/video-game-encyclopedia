Some I noticed before but didn't consider that serious, and some I just noticed when I finished the game</strong><br/>Things I gotta do:<br/>-Fix all the cutscene bugs<br/>-Change the hitbox in Level 6<br/>-Add a progress bar in Levels 1, 2, 3 and 4<br/>-Fix Level 3 score system (and collision and add death)<br/>-Fix Level 1 timings<br/>-Fix extra sound effect volume/times played<br/>-Add control tutorials<br/>Later:<br/>-Add difficulties <br/>IT'S TIME to Thunk on a Thursday Nite with the best rhythm game in 22 years! Follow Jim-Bob's day, which includes:<br/>Six levels that all play differently! (Two coming soon in updates)<br/>Uniquely animated cutscenes for each level, done in several different styles!<br/>An entertaining story!<br/>T.N.T. is pretty short, and will most likely only take around an hour to complete, which is why it's free. I doubt anybody would buy it if it costed money. But the whole TNTeam put a lot of effort into this game and we hope you enjoy it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-24T05:39:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a56074da721e913a42cd9e6f4e1dfa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TNTeam"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Memes and Dreams Ink."], "esrb_rating": null}
