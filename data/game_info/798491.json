In it, you play a character protecting a shelf from gathering dust using your vacuum weapon. Use the arrow keys/WASD to move left and right, and spacebar to shoot a gust of wind at the dust particles heading your way.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Details</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in 3 hours using the Unity engine by one bloke. It was a big challenge to finish a game in such a short timespan, but I'm happy I even managed to do that :)<br/></p><p>There were definitely features I had to drop since I didn't have enough time, but thankfully I planned all of the game's tasks in 'tiers' of importance so I got a basic playable game done before handling optional stuff (Like sound effects, title screen, etc.)</p><p>One thing I found really surprising was that tasks requiring my strongest skills took longer than expected and tasks requiring my weakest skills were faster than expected. This may be a result of 'overthinking' things that you know a lot about.</p><p>I am really happy that all the assets, graphics and code were created by hand during the 3 hour period.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T10:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3a/e3aed8680ada44f6c384a3a240f4f1e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emmet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
