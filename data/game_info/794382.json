The Gangstalker is roughly 2 times larger than the player,\u00a0 and I figured it would make more sense to make it deeper and more boomy.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Various Goofy Sound effects:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Gangstalker Caught you song:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please note: if anyone from Team Psykskallar finds this, and wants me to remove this song, please just contact me at my email, danielmorganjackson@gmail.com .
