You started a new job. It's pretty simple. And totally NOT mundane.</p><p>Created as part of Ludum Dare 38. Vote for us!<br/></p>Game Jam Stuff<p>Short blurb about the jam. Feel free to skip.</p><p>This is my second game jam, and second time doing LDJam. I'm quite pleased with how this entry turned out, so I hope everyone enjoys it. As per usual, I decided to be insane and learn an entire engine during the jam: it was my first time using GameMaker.</p><p>Just to explain the take on the theme in case anyone misses it: Becky works so much that her entire world is her job. It's a very very small world. Only her, the coffee, a computer and some staplers. :( Outside of that, taking the theme literally, the original size of all the assets (and the game) is a tiny 189x125.</p><p>I wanted to also try out using a different pixel style, palette, and using a palette restriction.</p><p>Everything was created during the jam, except for the music/sounds, which was provided by others.
