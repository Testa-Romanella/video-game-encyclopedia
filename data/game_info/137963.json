Navigate the space using only\u00a0gravitational fields of other particles and make sure to collect all three\u00a0collectables to complete each level.</p>\n<p>In every level, the player has a number of electrons and has to point and\u00a0shoot them in a direction to reach the destination. But the path to the\u00a0goal is not always straightforward. This is where Protons and Neutrons\u00a0come handy. These particles either attract or repulse the electron and\u00a0help navigate the space. Electrons also have to avoid walls and other\u00a0impassable objects. Some levels feature portals that teleport the\u00a0electron across the space. Players have the power to change the size of\u00a0protons and neutrons and control the attraction and repulsive power.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cca/cca57dd41ba60e1cce63dbf00ed83951.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Black Cube Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
