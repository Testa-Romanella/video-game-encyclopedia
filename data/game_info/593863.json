I started my learning curve by developing my very own 2D video game engine and I'm still working on it with enthusiasm. Since the engine is nothing without a game, I was developing a small platformer game demo to test my work and have some feedback.\u00a0<br/>Now I've decided to make it public.<br/>Since this game is just to test my work, the player can't die\u00a0:) Also, there is no save yet because the whole game is only 2 levels and\u00a0lasts about 5 minutes :)</p>\n<p>The game will continuously receive updates as I fix bugs, polish and add new features to the engine (particle system is up next!).<br/><br/>The source code together with my engine can be found on my\u00a0Github<br/><br/>I hope you will enjoy it, and I'm very happy to receive any feedback as it's an important part of learning.<br/><br/>Assets used for the game:<br/>https://rephil.ith.io/</p>\n<p>https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I've also taken part of the 48. Ludum Dare, here is my game I made for alone in 48 hours using the same engine:<br/></p>\n<p>https://lajbert.itch.io/mullettime<br/></p>\n<p>The map editor I'm using (and supported by the engine):<br/>https://ldtk.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:56:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/238/238dd13509c5fcb14382039ed6130ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lajbert"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
