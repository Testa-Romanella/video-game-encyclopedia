A space cat! </strong></p><p><strong>We made this game for #ilujam, a dating sim game jam! </strong></p><p><strong>There were some things we didn't get to implement due to the time restraint. One of them being an androgynous main character. We also want to update the art with color and backgrounds and of course add some music in the future too. </strong></p><p><strong>We hope you enjoy this game to follow it into our next build and other chapters!
