The plot continues the events of Diablo 3. A renegade angel Malthael decided that he should clean the world of demons. He stole the Black Soul Stone and is going to use it to imprison all the demons\u2019 souls. As a collateral damage, however, it will also devour the souls of all humanity. Since you, the Nephalem, have already defeated demons in Diablo 3, it is your duty now to save the world from an angel.<br />\nIn addition to five original Diablo 3 character classes, Reaper of Souls introduces a new one, Crusader \u2013 a heavily armored holy knight who uses large melee weapons and clerical spells. The maximum experience level the character can reach is raised up to 70. There\u2019s also an Adventure Mode that allows you to wander the randomized world, complete tasks and take rift crystals as a reward. The expansion adds more enemies and items and improves the loot system: as you progress, you will find less loot, but the items themselves will be more valuable.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2014-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T10:25:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/202/2023cb28ef354720a2ca4652727687d0.jpg", "website": "http://us.battle.net/d3/en/reaper-of-souls/", "rating": 4.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 71, "owned": 1809, "beaten": 808, "toplay": 52, "dropped": 142, "playing": 82}, "playtime": 20, "achievements_count": 98, "ratings_count": 892, "suggestions_count": 573, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 896, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One", "macOS", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Blizzard Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
