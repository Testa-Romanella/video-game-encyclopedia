Good luck commander!</p>\n<p>Background:</p>\n<p>Hello,\u00a0this is my first game, never mind my first game jam, but I still enjoyed the experience. I've only started learning unity recently but have had prior knowledge of python so some skills transferred. My link to the theme is questionable to say the least. However, I just followed the fun. My original idea was to have some asteroids to be real and others not to and you'd be able to tell with your cursor, but then it's evolved into what it is now. I'm happy with what it has turned into so I hope you enjoy it my high score is 5152 so hopefully you can beat it and of course any feedback, tips or anything of the kind\u00a0is appreciated.\u00a0Thanks and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T08:46:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afaa672832a3166b139b91c33adea017.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AdHam2899"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
