A 'base' will have a starting health of 25.<br/>\r\n- There are different zones for each type of cards, so creature cards can only be deployed in Battle Zone while spell cards are only in Spell zone.<br/>\r\n- Some creature cards can only attack cards, some can only attack the base, and there are those that can attack both.<br/>\r\n- Spell cards can affect creature cards as well as bases.
