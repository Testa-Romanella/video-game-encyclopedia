If they max out their needs in any way they can lose health. Health cannot be regained. If your buddy eats too much, they will become overweight and lose health.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play with them to exercise and lose that weight. If they become too dirty they will become sick and will need medication.</p>\n<p>A pill can be bought with enough gold. <br/>You can acquire gold by digging their poop away. This will also lessen the chance of your buddy staying in it. Staying in poop will accelerate your hygiene levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T06:58:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/797/797950cf072a27900c5a63f67580b975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["PronomicalArt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
