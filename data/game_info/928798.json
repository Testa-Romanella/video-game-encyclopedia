It would be good to check!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAquaHero is a casual-simulation game that involves protecting the aquatic space with the help of a superhero. Your mission is to find all the starfish so that they are not left as prey for the sharks and the rest of the predators. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe ocean is not the safest place, so you will need continuous oxygen to survive. Try to be good to everyone, but less to the sharks because you will be attacked once you are noticed by them or different species of fishes. Keep your distance, save the poor stars in peace. That way it will be better for everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame Features :<br/>\r\n- 40 levels<br/>\r\n- Aquatic environment<br/>\r\n- Flemish sharks<br/>\r\n- Limited oxygen", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T04:42:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f47b22dd6cc6705f71a92b3293f298d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atomic Fabrik", "Cristian Manolachi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atomic Fabrik", "Cristian Manolachi"], "esrb_rating": null}
