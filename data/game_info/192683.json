There's a mechanic in this game I've had the idea for for ages and only just last year (2017) did I finally bring it to life: Directional Wall Portals in a 2D Portal Game; as far as I know I do believe i'm the only one to come up with it, \"it just works\" ~ Todd Howard. <br/></p>\n<p>I'm currently working on a game right now that should blow this one out of the water, so stay tuned, that is if you're interested.</p>\n<p>I remember this taking me about 3 weeks to make, so I hope all that blood sweat and tears was worth it.</p>\n<p>The song used for background music in the game is called \"Twisted Light\" by HOME<br/></p>\n<p>The game is free but donations are always happily accepted and appreciated.</p>\n<p>That is all, enjoy and thanks for playing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/2181c10763ac45447df2ceb5396fbd69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlippinDollar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
