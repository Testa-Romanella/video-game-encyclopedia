Equipped with only his deadly katana he must protect the sacred tree from evil spirits.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>My inspiration for this game came from this video by Miziziziz. As a programmer I have a hard time creating original art for my projects, but it's something that I\u2019ve been interested in learning more about. I loved the art style in this video and decided to learn by recreating it. I came up with the idea for the game as I was working on creating the models. The game took me about 3 weeks of work from the time I started learning how to recreate the models in Blender to releasing it here. I don\u2019t plan to add more or make it into a more full game but wanted to release it anyways. I hope you enjoy it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T06:01:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b0/5b0936a1b7440a76549975cbc07626f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DomBash"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
