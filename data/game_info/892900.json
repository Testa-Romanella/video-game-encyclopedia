Revive these creatures after learning their final fate: the last whale harpooned, the final eagle caged, the last deer hunted down, and more, while you survive encounters with dangerous, oil-covered Devourers that roam the wasteland in search of remaining life.</p>\n<p>In this emotional journey from the creators of the critically acclaimed Arise: A Simple Story, you alone can restore life to the planet.</p>\n<p>Key Features:<br />\n\u2022 Gaia\u2019s journey: the last animals have died, and Mother has used all of her Life Force to save their souls, now trapped in their vessels. Gaia\u2019s quest is to rescue each of their souls and bring them back to Mother\u2019s Ark. Gaia\u2019s traversal abilities will allow you to glide, jump, and dash to explore new areas and evade deadly traps, while her special gifts will grant you the power to clear the oil that consumes the world, face hungry Devourers, and break souls free.</p>\n<p>\u2022 A vast, surrealistic world: see through Gaia\u2019s eyes the desolated landscapes that depict the destructive relationships between humans and nature in a beautiful demonstration of abstract artistry. From dying forests to the heart of crumbling cities, through the dry seabed and polluted skies, each environment will offer new challenges for Gaia to face and will present her different versions of the Devourers\u2019 wake of destruction as she spreads life and beauty on her path.</p>\n<p>\u2022 A story of contrasts: After Us offers a somber look at a world decimated by human impact. As you guide Gaia\u2019s light through it and discover the causes behind the destruction, you will learn the fate of the Devourers as agents of extinction, but also agents of progress, love, and hope.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-18T01:01:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7c4/7c4625ca5e67bd6224c044fce030a2a6.jpg", "website": "https://store.privatedivision.com/game/after-us", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 14, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 34, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["Piccolo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Private Division"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
