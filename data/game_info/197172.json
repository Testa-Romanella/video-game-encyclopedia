Bounce off of multiple slime monsters in a row to reach a combo and beat the game! :D</p><p>\r\n\t\tWhere is the theme? Well, it's in our hearts. No, wait, it's in this game.

That's not because I didn't have time to make actual scenery, it was for the theme!\r\n</p>Update #1: Now On Android!<p>\r\n\tOk, I'm a little more excited about this game now that it works on my phone. :D Note: It doesn't seem to like multitasking.</p><p>\r\n\t(12/12/2016)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77d/77d675e483ec85906c10196917857914.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dmitri"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
