Good ones encourage us and bad ones humble us.<br/><br/>I am constantly fixing bugs that are brought up to me and trying to change things that bother people. It takes time since I am just one guy (Imago Software is only two guys) dealing with many issues. Still things will improve in future updates that I&amp;#39;m working on.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, obviously this is a paid game and I don&amp;#39;t want to disappoint or cheat people out of their money.<br/><br/>Here&amp;#39;s a gameplay video from TouchArcade&amp;#39;s Sanuku (Thank you!):<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3O9tw2L5Wg&amp;amp;feature=plcp<br/><br/>This may help with your purchase decision! Also our own video that include game tutorials are at<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/user/Playimago<br/><br/>@Matthew Haralson<br/>Yes, the minor character development was very weak. More dialogs will be written in part of effort to more complete game experience!<br/><br/>@Tony Peniyoung<br/>I was going to answer your concern but didn&amp;#39;t really get the message!<br/><br/>@Grievlocke<br/>Wow, having big battle animations will be really cool. Number 1 in my wish list too. Simply there was no budget and it looks like there will be no budget in the future, either- looking at the sales.<br/><br/>@Many who wanted more stages<br/>I had random map generation for more guild quests, but I couldn&amp;#39;t get the quality right yet. Random really never worked with the element of strategy, and became just a brute fighting.<br/>Partia 2 was planned for 25 stages that wraps up the story, but at 600 games sold, well, I wonder if I could ever get enough budget.<br/><br/>@ErnieBernie876<br/>I know it is not as convenient as having a restart button, but you could suspend the game and load the last save data to restart the stage from the beginning.<br/><br/>@frozencracker<br/>It would be a bug if you have an attack option without having a valid target, but I can&amp;#39;t seem to reproduce it. To cancel the attack while targeting, you could press &amp;#39;B&amp;#39; button (that&amp;#39;s the inside button) or you could choose a target then select No.<br/><br/>I will try my best to answer any question!
