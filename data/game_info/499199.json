Collect it all before its too late. You have 30 seconds to complete 2 levels. On each level you need to parkour around tricks and traps that try to stop you from reaching your honey. Once you reach your honey you need to return to your hot air balloon to advance to the next level. This game was inspired by the popular game on Coolmathgames called \"60\u00a0SECOND BURGER RUN\".\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move and jump</p>\n<p>I didn't have time to finish the game. It is extremely incomplete. I originally was hoping for 4 levels and 60 seconds but I guess life happens. There were a lot of features I'm really disappointed I\u00a0couldn't add.\u00a0I have school so I have to upload my project a bit early. I'm going to fix this up at some point and make it a polished game.\u00a0 Any advice you can offer is appreciated.</p>\n<p>Note: Everything here was made by me, Goatmeal123, except for the character controller which was made by Brackey's. Also, this was my first ever game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:38:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba4c2bd38340cab2d3f1da64a286632.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Goatmeal123"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
