Look out for shining balls.\u00a0Chalk powers can be combined.</p>\r\nThe Goal\r\n<p>The goal is to simply clear the table with at least one cue ball left. Avoid potting cue balls. If all cue balls are potted, you will lose and the table will be reset. Cue balls can be hit even when they're moving, so you'll have a small chance to save them from pockets. When a table is cleared, any chalk you've acquired will carry over to a new table.</p>\r\nChallenges\r\n<p>Test your pool skills with 20 challenge levels. Clear the table with limited shots using super powered chalk to unleash pool fury.</p>\n\n<p>Sound effects from\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T06:01:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6b26587597f12739ae72db4d28055d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BudgieM2"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
