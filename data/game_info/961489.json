Have fun in 43 levels, gaining speed upgrades, shock powerups to slow other racers, repairing powerups and rockets to shoot kamikaze drones.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSimplified controls make it possible for everyone to fly. Just go up and down, turn left and right.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt the end of the 40 levels, 3 time challenges are available for unlimited gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSwitch to the first person view for more immersive gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlays best with a controller! The right stick used for steering left and right is very sensitive. It will be needed later, when racing becomes more extreme.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"NightHover\" is also available now for free in Google Play on Android. Steering on Android is done by turning the phone like a steering wheel. You might want to try it, if you do not like a keyboard or a controller.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-29T03:57:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8dadb01320667322eb7eb44e20afe516.jpg", "website": "https://www.coolexgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoolExGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CoolExGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
