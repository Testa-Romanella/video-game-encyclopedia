A good chunk of which was spent screwing around. I won't charge for this POS unless I come back to it later to refine it as an actual project. I will shamelessly ask for donations, though.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls?:</p>\n<p>Arena Name Button: M1 to set your arena's name<br/><br/>Entry Fee and Jackpot buttons: M1 to set the cost of a contender slot and the theoretical victory jackpot if they were to win<br/><br/>Open@ Button: Set the time you open (hour, default 7, can be no later than 21 (9PM))<br/></p>\n<p>Dungeon button: opens up the mob cells and reception counter to buy/sell mobs and contenders. Left-click on the mob cells or reception desk to buy mobs or accept applicants. Right-click a specific mob or contender who is present to get rid of <br/><br/>Schedule button: opens up a TV-Guide-like menu where you set each gate at particular times. Left-Mouse cycles through the type (None, Mob Contender) and right mouse cycles through which specific mob cell or contender is to use that door</p>\n<p>Start Day button: Starts the day from the Open@ time (default 7AM). once active, it will stop either automatically at 10PM (22:00) or if you click the button again. Either way will end the day and start over the next day.</p>\n\n<p>Things I wanted to add but I need to move on, so maybe in the future?:<br/>Audience - ticket sales/ arena popularity<br/>More mob variety<br/>Editable timescale<br/>Editable close time<br/>Victory scenarios<br/>Permadeath<br/>Losing/Gameover</p>\n<p>The lesson to learn from this project: Try not to let the little things slow you down when you're working on the general infrastructure, but maintain a balance with making sure the foundation is accessible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T03:48:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fe/6fe4bd9aa09ab1b800447ce673a23855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tathlibash"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
