Hopefully you have some fun playing it! :)\r\n\r\n  </p>\n<p>Some retro SNES like game. Not trying to follow the jam theme.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Move  around the restaurant with arrow or WASD keys and deliver orders before  the time runs out. Gather items by jumping on them. Hop around the  place and get a plate to put the necessary ingredients on. Crates filled  with food are scattered around the area, so look carefully. Then find  an oven and cook the food. Once cooked, bring the dish to the awaiting  customer. Be careful of what you put on the plate as you will not be  able to remove ingredients that are wrong. You will need to throw the  plate in the trash and start over.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:42:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00ea9857107a017e193ba827bc6b8084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Daniel Nael"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
