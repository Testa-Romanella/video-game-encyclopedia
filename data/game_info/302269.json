You've out of jump fuel. But, there are planets around you, where you can find that fuel. But you need to drop you marines on those planets to discover fuel and maybe... something more.</p>\n\n<p>TIPS and PS:</p>\n<p>- This is NOT an easy game. This game heavily based on RNG, and this RNG, I tell you, not an easy going on players (sometimes you would discover that goal is too far away for you to take, but you could try, anyway). But there are rules, of course. And you can win. The big idea is there is situation - bad situation. And you, as commander is trying to get out of this situation. But, life is life, maybe this is all useless. Or maybe not.<br/></p>\n<p>- This game was made for mini jam 23, so it lacks any kind of sounds - turn on your favourite space music for atmosphere. I really, really did not have time to compose music and sounds :|<br/></p>\n<p>- Some buttons disappear, and you may not see the effect at once. Do not worry, just wait. Game log system updates not so quickly, but you will see an effect.</p>\n<p>- I tried to debug furiously this game, but you may experience some problems sometime. As much as I'm aware, no major hiccups.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T04:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9ded379d78300e8f4b8dce0428962fc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["idchlife"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
