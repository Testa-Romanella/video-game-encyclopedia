The objective is to complete the game in the shortest time the player\u00a0can. There is a currency system where the player can collect and spend brains to upgrade the zombies to increase their speed, attack damage and sight radius.</p>\n<p>When you first start the game, you must choose a graveyard to spawn the zombies into. Once they are spawned, they will run around and start to turn the humans, your job as the player is to collect any brains they drop across the map as well as unlock achievements for extra brains along the way. Once enough brains have been obtained, you can unlock upgrades for the zombies which help the game speed up for a quicker time to finish. You can also attract zombies to a specific location on the map if you place meat down, this is so that if any humans are running or hiding away that you can still get them and actually control the horde if you want to.\r\n</p>\n<p>All assets were free and sourced online from\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/assets</p>\n<p>I used an Achievement Plugin from by Sam Carey\u00a0https://samcarey.itch.io/</p>\n<p>I developed the game alone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T09:35:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e5feaf138451e0353b5896d6eb58376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NancySilsby"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
