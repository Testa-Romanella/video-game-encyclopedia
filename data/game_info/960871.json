So imagine Masha&#39;s surprise when a greedy industrialist starts snapping up all the land in Petsville in order to build a factory that produces plastic animals. Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, she makes a beeline for the town to show how pet care can rake in more money than selling fake cats and dogs. To save the day, you&#39;ll have to provide a variety of services to a stampede of customers and their animals. There will scarcely be a moment to breathe as you wash and groom seven different pets, keep your equipment in working order, sell exclusive products, beat 14 different mini-games, purchase advertising, upgrade your salon and keep tails wagging. Featuring fast-paced gameplay, eye-popping graphics and lively music, Pet Craze Show is destined to become a stunning time management success!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-16T07:35:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/583/58334e2d92210f953a9a81a44c2944ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Five-BN"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Family"], "publishers": ["Alawar Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
