There will be many obstacles that come your way and you have to do all in your power in order to avoid them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you go through the level you will be able to collect eggs, which will offer you immediate access to a variety of great new characters. Eggs are hard to get and many times you will have to go through trial and error in order to acquire them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf the Normal game mode is too simple for you, we also offer an Insane mode where the enemies will move a lot faster so it will be even more challenging for you to move onward and acquire the eggs. The eggs will also allow you to purchase new themes, so if you do get enough you can also explore new locations and levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUpcoming:<br/>\r\n- macOS support<br/>\r\n- More characters<br/>\r\n- New levels of difficulty<br/>\r\n- Powerups", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-06T12:07:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e43/e4322029541bfafde4c3f9e78c91cb10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.81, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 793, "beaten": 5, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 32, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 32, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unika Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Unika Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
