So I decided to a small fan-game about Pyke.</p>\n<p>My first goal was to create a small part of Bilgewater and have Pyke lurking in it.</p>\n<p>Then I decided to keep it shorter and went with small boss encounters since I was binging souls-like games. I started to design 5 fights.</p>\n<p>Right after I was done with 2 of them, Elden Ring released.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that's the end of the story basically\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>This is 2/5 of a\u00a0minimised version of the project I initially planned.\u00a0<strong> (Ezreal &amp; Cait)</strong></p>\n<p>But there are still some cool scenes in it. So I hope you enjoy it &lt;3</p>\n<p>.</p>\r\n-- Lore\u00a0--\r\n<p>Go check out the official lore page of my favourite support :)</p>\n<p>https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champion/pyke/<br/></p>\n<p>.</p>\r\n-- Credits --\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Just writing down some of the things used in this project if anyone wonders:\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Amazing soundtracks are all from\u00a0Riot\u00a0Games Music &amp; Riot Forge.</li><li>Other than Ledros and Pyke, all character models were got from the trailer package Riot Games shared in their 2020\u00a0Warriors cinematic post.\u00a0</li><li>Used Polaris for landscape design mainly.\u00a0</li><li>Main menu scene is direct reference to the\u00a0lore page.</li></ul>\n<p>.</p>\r\n-- Further Legal Notice\u00a0--\r\n<p><em>I am not affiliated with Riot Games, Inc, the creators of League of Legends.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>League of Legends and its characters\u00a0are registered trademarks of Riot Games, Inc.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>As per Riot\u00a0Game's Terms of Service/EULA, I(the developer of this fan-game) will not profit from this product and will remove it completely upon request.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>https://www.riotgames.com/en/legal\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T11:55:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e0/5e0bc878f4e3ea746dfec415fe4881b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahmetahaydemir"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
