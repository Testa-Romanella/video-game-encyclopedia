You must clean it out.</strong></p>\n<p>Rogue Basement is a very simple roguelike. Its distinguishing features are:</p>\n<p>* There is only one level, but there is still progression</p>\n<p>* An experienced player can win in less than 10 minutes, but it still has a discovery process for new players</p>\n<p>* A pretty decent soundtrack that changes with the environment</p>\n<p>A full experience with the game will probably take between 15 and 45 minutes, depending on much of a completionist you are.</p>\n<p>If you have trouble launching the game, please email me!</p>\n<p>Ludum Dare game page<br/></p>\n<p>Original soundtrack (free!)<br/></p>\n<p>Development progression screen shots<br/></p>\n<p>Online manual</p>\n<p>Source code</p>\n<p>Dev log YouTube playlist</p>\n<p><strong>**************************************</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay notes for compo build:</strong></p>\n<p>You can melee monsters by walking into them. I somehow forgot to mention this in the manual.<br/></p>\n<p>Due to an amusing bug, the map renders 4 times. If you think the exit is inaccessible, you're probably just looking at a mirage.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>POST-compo build differences:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Field of view (FOV)! This makes the game a lot more fun.</li><li>Log messages are much less confusing.</li><li>Rocks can no longer be thrown into walls.</li><li>Monsters no longer pick up gold.
