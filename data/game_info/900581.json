There has been a LOT of changes, some things have been removed for now before making their way back in...\u00a0</p>\n<p>What is available?</p>\n<p>This has so far just forbidden valley accessible from the park, however it is a brand new player character system, lighting, weather, fast travel, objectives, ride cameras, operable rides and much more optimizations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This will receive more frequent updates as new things are added, and tested, eventually having it update the original version. We did not want to update that one and remove the functionality till we have it updated in this version.</p>\n\n<p>THIS IS NOT FINISHED! There will be bugs, there may be hitches, glitches, breakages, and anything else that can go wrong. We are still only a small team, it takes time to get things right.</p>\n<p>Please only download via the App link as this will guarantee future updates directly to your version,</p>\n\n<p>We are very grateful for the support and more ways to contribute to the Virtual Towers Project are in the works .
