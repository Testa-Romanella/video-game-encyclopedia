Eventually, we came up with this idea of a single player 2D platforming game\u00a0that players actually control two characters at the same time. Currently, we have three levels in the game, and the difference between different levels fits the learning curve of most players really well. They understand some tricks\u00a0quickly and apply that trick immediately to puzzle solving.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/568/5689c22b4f8e76aae8f41a1b594c76ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["keyanz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
