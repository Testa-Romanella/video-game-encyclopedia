Therefore, when I created this game I wanted to incorporate two things that I am passionate about: healthcare and technology. This game serves as a relaxation tool. As a healthcare worker in the field of psych everyone is always looking for a way to cool down and relax. Hence why for my new features I added calming music, directional light, the ability to state what time of the day the game is being played, and a 30-second timer because at times all we need is 30 seconds to help us relax just a bit. This does not mean that once the initial 30 seconds are up the game can not be played any longer, but it is proving that just 30 seconds of meditation and relaxation can help. The user should feel not only entertained but relaxed upon playing the game and completing the game. My features are different from the features created during class because my features serve the purpose of helping one to relax.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T06:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ec4a4a8007013893565d26958f9dff8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jeo29"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
