Before you play the game, you should bind all the controls first.</p>\n<p><strong>THE GAME</strong><br/></p>\n<p>PaintBattle is a 2d platformer shooter local multiplayer game. Your goal is to protect your own Nexus while attacking your enemy's Nexus. To do so, you have to rely on your guns and abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>THE LOBBY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The lobby is the place where everybody customizes their character. Entering is just as simple as pressing the Use button. Make your selection by pressing the Jump and Down keys and when you are done, press Use. If you changed your mind and want to go back, press the Shoot button. Once everybody that has entered the lobby is done and has entered their name, a new button will appear called Start Game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IN-GAME</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You will spawn next to your nexus. Also next to your nexus you can change the weapon you are currently using by pressing Use.</p>\n\n<p>In the middle of the map, you can purchase blocks and abilities and\u00a0they can only be used once per purchase.\u00a0 The basic building block can be placed anywhere on the map, but the block upgrades can only be used only when standing on a block the same color as yours. In case you can't upgrade a block, try walking over it a few times while trying to upgrade (game still has unsolved bugs)\u00a0. To make a block have the same color as yours, you have to shoot it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PLAYER UI</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The Player UI consists of 3 major things. Your gold, your ammo, and your inventory.</p>\n<p>Gold can be achieved in many ways. You either shoot blocks which grant you 1 gold per shot, kill players which grant you 10 gold per kill, or even attacking the enemy nexus can reward with you gold(1 gold per 1 damage).</p>\n<p>Ammo is pretty simple to understand. Run out of it and it automatically reloads. You can also reload by pressing the Reload button.</p>\n<p>The Inventory also consists of 2 major things. The upper layer contains blocks/ upgrades for your blocks and the lower layer contains your abilities. To place blocks, you can use the Block1, Block2, Block3 buttons, each one corresponding to one inventory slot, and the same thing applies to your abilities by pressing Spell1, Spell2 or Spell3.</p>\n<p><strong>THE NEXUS</strong></p>\n<p>The Nexus has 200 hp. The only way you can notice how much health it has left is by looking at how much you have colored it.</p>\n\n<p>That's about it. For any bug reports, make sure to leave a comment. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a89/a8991860961cfeb47cc51129ad483667.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AndrewIGD"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
