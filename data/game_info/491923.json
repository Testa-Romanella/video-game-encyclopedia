Experiment with fun and wacky ways of winning the game! Shops can be found across the main map and you can upgrade items by finding shards in crates or in random locations. Locations with high populations have chances of getting caught in a death sphere, which can damage you and your opponents. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBoss Battle - Fight a massive enemy and traverse the castle! Navigate the castle and avoid the obstacles. Damage him using your weapon, and collect ammo along the way. There are three phases, so get ready!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCastle Defense - As a defender, upgrade your castle and protect your shard vault from getting hijacked. As an attacker, upgrade your perks and be as stealthy as possible. Needs 2 or more players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T08:01:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae3d3e617828dd9d705b0f1434fbdd63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blaze"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blaze"], "esrb_rating": null}
