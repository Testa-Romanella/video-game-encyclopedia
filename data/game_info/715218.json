Servers maybe not work due to so many people joining, so it can load infinitely (and yes it includes singleplayer too because I made some mistakes while making it...). All donations will be put towards better servers. You can join the server here but PLEASE READ THE #FAQ CHANNEL! (and play the tutorial ingame)\u00a0https://discord.gg/fX9mbhCQA3. New update will be when I get a new PC, somewhere in mid 2022. And it's only for windows. And you need a pretty powerful PC to run it so... don't expect to play it on a 2009 ThinkPad. Most of issues with servers etc will be fixed in the next update so stay tuned. Next year in 2022 gonna be crazy.<br/>You can donate me here if you wish to or using itch.io integrated donate function.<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=8JNMCTCMEXPCG<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:33:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f404b6f409aa12c89d33cd3b25a1e621.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["s1nn3r"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
