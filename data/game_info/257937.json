This results in the fact that they play more humanly than machine and are less predictable. The game also allows you to start from the random layout of the 3 first elements. There is also the possibility to move forward and backwards (replay). There are 7 levels of difficulty.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/770/7705bd2c2bc868974fada9fe1e7ccd42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zxretrosoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
