Completion time will take about 2 - 3 hours.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c53/c53f159d4b4daed80eeff49d6a1baef4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NolanAlighieri"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
