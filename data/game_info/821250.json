(Sorry, didn't have time)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Story Behind:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>After watching this years GMTK Game Jam theme video I started thinking about randomness, statistics, etc. But nothing I came up with was fun... it all sounded more like \"Make a game and make it less boring by adding randomness\".</p>\n<p>Then, not sure why, I remembered a game called \"A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build\" and I thought I could build something similar with the dice theme.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>I assumed there would be many games following this idea, so I decided to add a height layer to it. By being able to stack dices and have more than 1 dice, I think I expanded the mechanics a lot.</p>\n<p>I'm quite proud of the end result. This was my first 3D game in Godot, my first solo 3D game and definitely the best one I've done so far! I especially like the minimalist look with the chill background music.</p><p>This is my 4th year in a row joining the GMTK Game Jam and I'm very happy about the progress I've made :)<br/></p><p>Anyways, if you've actually read this far. Thank you very much! I really enjoyed making this game and I will join next year for sure!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/069/06947b39ca834ff06f5d0f49597bf4b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ErikTheBerik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
