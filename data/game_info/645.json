Follow strange beasts through lonely forests, hazardous mountains, dark caves, and glowing swamps. Watch out for dangerous creatures that react to your movements and decisions, and cleverly concealed traps that will test your ability to survive. Over six years in the making, FEIST is a gorgeous hand-made adventure unlike anything else, with a cinematic presentation reminiscent of The Dark Crystal or Hedgehog in the Fog, and a tense original soundtrack by Tomek Kolczynski.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T23:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d7/4d75ca1f69abb3a592cac3810d23f5cb.jpg", "website": "http://playfeist.net/", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 220, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 12}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 162, "ratings_count": 29, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 30, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Linux", "PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Finji", "Last Chance Media", "Bits", "Bits & Beasts", "Beasts"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Finji", "Last Chance Media"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
