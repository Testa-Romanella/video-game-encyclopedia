Since then it has become a collectors item.</p>\n<p>Only a handful games were ever made for it. <br/></p>\n<p>Frag Zombie is one of them.</p>\r\n-\u00a0 \u00a0- \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0 -  \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 - \u00a0 -\r\n\n\n\n<p>Made for the FZ 25 year anniversary game jam. The theme was \"25\" and I thought to myself, would it be possible to make a game in 25x25 pixels? And also somehow make it about a 25 year old handheld console?<br/></p>\n<p>Well, seems like it was possible! Mostly, I had to cut some corners. But this project was a lot of fun and I got to try out a reload mechanic that I've thought about for ages. So try it out and blast some zombies with your pistol &amp; shotgun, see how many you can get before they get you!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Only works with a keyboard currently!<br/>Follow arrows in the bottom right corner to perform a reload.<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys: Aim &amp; Reload<br/>Space: Fire<br/>Shift: Change weapon<br/>M: Turn off music<br/>Escape: Quit (desktop only)<br/></p>\n\r\nSound credits\r\n<ul><li>Pistol Dry Fire: https://freesound.org/people/Sophia_C/sounds/467183/\u00a0</li><li><p>Pistol Unload: https://freesound.org/people/fastson/sounds/399122/\u00a0</p></li><li><p>Shotgun Dry Fire: https://freesound.org/people/knova/sounds/170272/</p></li><li>Switch Weapon: https://freesound.org/people/knova/sounds/170273/</li><li><p>Zombie 1: https://freesound.org/people/Slave2theLight/sounds/157027/ <br/></p></li><li><p>Zombie 2: https://freesound.org/people/silentbob530/sounds/214462/ <br/></p></li><li>Zombie 3: https://freesound.org/people/revolverrossalot/sounds/474055/ </li><li>Player Death: https://freesound.org/people/theuncertainman/sounds/417539/</li><li>Music: https://jimhallmusic.bandcamp.com/album/mishmash-ep</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T08:33:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da7/da7fd4c2d8ad17dd628bab8038dba4ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anwilc"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
