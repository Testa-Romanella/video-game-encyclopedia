It's quite short, and playtime varies between 20 - 35 minutes. It is a completed project.</p>\n<p><em>-No random encounters or main menu. Saves are done via crystals found on maps.</em></p>\n<p><em>-Focuses on atmosphere that uses an ambient soundtrack and storytelling than raw gameplay.\u00a0</em></p><p><em>-No character levels or\u00a0 grinding to be done.
