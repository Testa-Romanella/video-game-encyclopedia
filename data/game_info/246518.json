All simulated in tremendous detail. I've taken the best parts of past city builders and improved on them to make this the best one yet. <br/><br/><strong>Future Updates, DLC Policy, and Mod support</strong><br/>As someone who has been playing city builders for over 20+ years this game is a passion project that I've wanted to work on for a long time. My mission is to make a better, more challenging city builder. I want the player to lose track of time in this game and get engrossed in the experience. My commitment is to not stop once the game is shipped. There will continue to be updates including new features, new buildings, and more for many years after the game is released. I will continue to add features to the game for free after the game is released. You will be able to add new content including buildings, through robust mod support.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/616605f320e4f5faf2cff1f22bef4f24.jpg", "website": "http://www.metropolisim.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Halfway Decent Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Halfway Decent Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
