Please contact me through Twitter, My Website, or the forums if you encounter something wrong with the game, something misleading on the store page, or you just want to say hello. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking a moment to read this; I really hope you enjoy playing my game.<br/>Adam Nickerson - Nickervision Studios<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Your ship can not stop moving; so you must turn it left and right and use your boost/brake to keep from crashing into an ever increasing amount of enemies.<br/></li><li>Your ship is always shooting, so make sure to pick up more ammo and the wide variety of awesome power ups and pick ups to help you survive longer.<br/></li><li>Get the highest score you can while collecting coins to buy more ships that are faster, shoot faster, or have more shields.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A throwback to the classic quarter eating arcade games of the 80's.
