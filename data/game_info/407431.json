From hundreds of iterations, I then curated fragments and phrases that I found interesting, and revised them to fit into an octave poem form. You and I write the letter together, and Melville, Goldman, Markov, Twine, and myself write the poem for you.<br/><br/><strong>Why:\u00a0</strong>This work was created for the\u00a0Gaming Like It's 1924\u00a0jam, in celebration of\u00a0<em>Billy Budd</em>\u00a0entering the public domain. Mixing Melville and Goldman was mostly about personal taste, but the hybrid of images and ideas from these sources together suggested a sort of lost dream of political and sexual liberation from another century, or a parallel world, which is what inspired the text of the letter.<br/><br/>The music is an original composition. More of my work can be found on\u00a0my website\u00a0and\u00a0my Twitter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:39:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b81/b817009c748feb85d2e4eb91036ef430.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sissyfist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
