I recently finished a project that involved making a prototype for a game. The game did really well with the students and the teachers so i decided to finish and publish the game. I will soon (next wednesday) start a kickstarter project to fund the marketing, creation and publishing of the game. I am here, posting this message to promote the game and get some people's attention. I have had great fun creating and playing the game and i am sure other people will also have fun with it.</p>\n<p>It is a fast-paced action/strategy game that really puts your skills to the test.</p>\n<p>You can watch the trailer here:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oKey4ycg5I&amp;t=1s</p>\n<p>Or my facebook page here:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/comboranger/\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, suggestions or feedback you can send me a message here, on facebook or send me an email at\u00a0erik.comboranger@gmail.com</p>\n<p>If you love the game please share it with other people or donate when the kickstarter begins!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee6/ee6e7dcc3822350df23a4924cccf61c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ComboRanger"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
