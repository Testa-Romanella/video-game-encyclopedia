I will update it with other stuff eventually, based on feedback, so let me know what you'd like to see!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T04:09:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/02373dc11f6601543158ac9227706f02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ModalModule"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
