In that regard, the game\u00a0is developed on the idea that all of \"us\" experience conflict either\u00a0as two people or within our minds. So, we are often compelled to reconcile with one another to come together or get something done.\u00a0 Accordingly, this game\u00a0compels two players to reach the same color in order to pass the level. Each crystal on the way changes the color of the background and they find themselves cooperating if they want to unite the seperated twins on two sides of the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:44:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14c/14c69c2647feda61e2ec79c9693038b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["uniteus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
