I wanted to interrogate the problematic themes and tendencies that often go unaddressed in the tales themselves. What would a fairytale be without the flowery language intent on masking rather sinister undercurrents? Would the story be different if the \u2018hero\u2019 were a perfectly average guy? This modern take hopes to provide social commentary concerning these questions and the original\u2019s general narrative.
