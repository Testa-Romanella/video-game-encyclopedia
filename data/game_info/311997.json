Restock your nut supply while evading the winter storm and multiple predators.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>The squirrel can glide</li>\n<li>A wintery storm chases you through each level</li>\n<li>Difficult mechanics that make even simple levels a challenge</li></ul>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>I began this project as a final game for one of my University's courses. The goal of this project was to create a fully functioning game. While this is my first attempt at a functioning game, I believe others may have a lot of fun trying to beat the 3 levels with the difficult (probably clunky) platformer mechanics</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T04:11:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de1/de11b8ae0f70cb2c95032f36855346cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrTedlz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
