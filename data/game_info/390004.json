Move left, right and jump to get through each level. Due to Construct 2 free limitations, I can't develop it longer in this program. That's why I'm going to make a bigger \u017belu\u015b on another engine. Only the Polish version is available but you don't have to read to pass this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T02:46:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dc/3dc839cc763a66d27fda70edcc387953.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dawidak"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
