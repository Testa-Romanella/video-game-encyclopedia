You loved him, you miss him \u2014 and now he's gone. All you have left of him is his legendary boxing gloves, and an aching emptiness in your dog-chest. An emptiness that slowly starts to fill with anger. You can still smell the people who slaughtered your master, their scent fresh in your nose. It calls you, and a deep, primal hunger awakens inside. The urge to <strong><em>HUNT</em></strong>. To <strong><em>KILL</em></strong>. With a howl you grab your master's gloves, and set out into the night to avenge his death.<br/></p>\n<p>Join Biff the boxer dog as he ventures through old Chicago looking for the one who took the life of his owner (and best friend). With his new powers to transform into a ferocious boxing were-dog Biff takes on the streets and anyone foolish enough to stand in his way in hopes to redeem his owners name and legacy.<br/></p>\n<em>FEATURES:\u00a0\u00a0BOSS FIGHTS!\u00a0HEAPS OF ENEMIES!\u00a0PUNCHING STUFF!\u00a0DOG PHYSICS (far superior to cat physics)!\u00a0RAGDOLLS!\u00a0SILLY VOICES!\u00a0DOG PUNS!\u00a0AND MUCH MUCH MORE...</em>\n\n<em>BAD TO THE BONE IS A GAME MADE BY DRAGONDROP GAMES\u00a0AND OTHERS AS A FINAL PROJECT AT SAE QANTM.</em>\n\n<em>THE TEAM</em>\n<em>  PROJECT MANAGER &amp; PROGRAMMER</em>\n<p>Darryl Long\u00a0 \u2014  LarrylDong</p>\n<em>CREATIVE LEAD</em>\n<p>Paul Frame\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0\u00a0PaulCFrame</p>\n<em>GAME DESIGN &amp; ASSETS</em>\n<p>Nick Duxbury\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0NicholasDuxbury<br/>Victor Weidar\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0\u00a0VictorWeidar</p>\n<em>AUDIO WIZARDS</em>\n<p>CheuckNam Wong\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0\u00a0WCBlue<br/>Yui Ming Lam\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0\u00a0MagicDPM</p>\n<em>GRAPHIC DESIGN &amp; MARKETING</em>\n<p>Aline Otr\u00e9us\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0\u00a0alineotreus\r\n</p>\n<em>VOICE ACTING &amp; COACHING</em>\n<p>Tony Parmenter\u00a0 \u2014 \u00a0Kalinskald</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e4/7e42a16dfd6bc9faf0a5a3dcee487940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Victor Weidar", "Nicholas Duxbury", "LarrylDong", "Dragon Drop Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
