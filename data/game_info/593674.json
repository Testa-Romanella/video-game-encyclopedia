We do have some bad news though... We did surgically remove your legs as part of Sub Section D\u00a0: 4-72 A of the License and Agreement portion of your contract, and in the process may or may not have slipped our hand and removed your corneas as well... :/ (Please note that we are not responsible for such actions and law suits will be waived as part of the License and Agreement). So, you'll have to use your imagination! (Fun!) But, we are giving you this high tech device called the\u00a0Multidimensional Orientating\u00a0Uniform Surroundings Extractor, or \"MOUSE\" for short, so that should make up for any incoming lawsuits.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do is press that left button on your MOUSE, and you will be swapped to a different dimension\u00a0\u00a0for a split second, creating the illusion of a jump! And yes, this works mid air too. Of course, you could just climb the wall by holding down that button, but we'd prefer it if you didn't. Upon completion of this program, you will be awarded bragging rights. Now, get to it, Volunteer 42!</p>\n<p>[*NOTE* - Any \"Branching Universe Geomatical Severities\": BUGS that you 'experience'\u00a0do not exist, and is just a misinterpretation of your mind, as your corneas have been removed :)\u00a0 Happy Testing!]</p>\n\n<p>{Known Bugs &amp; Warnings -- Will Be Updated As\u00a0Comments Come In --}</p>\n<p>Spinning while colliding with the edge walls will sometimes not register a collision, and not change your direction</p>\n<p>When hitting Lava at an angle, may spawn Lava particle effects more than once</p>\n<p>Sound Settings reset on every playthrough</p>\n<p>Very last level is broken... :(</p>\n<p>Janky physics (- Thanks Daaims!)</p>\n<p>PLEASE PLAY IN FULL SCREEN! A resolution bug causes the camera to be clipped, and is not intentional</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in 6 days, and as it's my first time ever completing a game, it is quite messy. There are probably a lot of bugs I haven't seen yet, as I rushed the code, but over all I think I did a pretty good job for my first 'finished' game! Let me know what you think, and please make sure to comment any bugs you find!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd8/dd8ef6f0aabfbcf628ce7112a04d9fe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CongaCode"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
