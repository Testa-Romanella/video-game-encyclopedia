This is just a prototype, a foundation. I uploaded this becouse I want to have a place where I can update the game and someone can maybe download it and try it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am not a really good programmer, so the development takes so much time. I have to watch a lot of tutorials just to figure out one thing. So the game is a bit bugged here and there, well alot.</p>\n<p>There is my roadmap, I will try to keep it updated, for you and also for me to keep track of things that I want to do.\u00a0https://trello.com/b/af6Wi1uE/d0not-let-them</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70a2fbf47fcdd6c261696cd5a148d50b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["d0not"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
