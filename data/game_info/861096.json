You must fight the forces of Light/Evil and overcome them to win!\u00a0 You need two people to play this game, the character on the left is controlled with WASD and their attack button is E.\u00a0 The character on the right is controlled with the Arrow Keys and their attack button is Right Shift.</p>\n\n<p>If you press E/RShift by itself then you will perform a simple attack, however if you press E/RShift whilst holding one of the movement keys then the characters will use one of their directional attacks. Two side attacks, one up attack and finally one down attack. Each attack comes with their own pros and cons. Some come out faster but do less damage where others come out slower but do more damage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Note: You have to close the game and reopen it to play again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T21:10:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db6/db659b29b71e59475c58c0753d340d90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OliverNielsen2003"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
