It is an abandoned temple known well as the Temple of the Dragons, and is located in the Eastern Realm of Eremidia. In order to capture the high-value artifact \"Skyglyph\", our party recklessly enters the temple. Can you help them retrieve the Skyglyph?</p>\n<p>This game is not an exercise in complex storytelling. I'm not an expert writer, so I'm keeping it simple.
