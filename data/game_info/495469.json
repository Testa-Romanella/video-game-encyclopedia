It was originally planned to be for both the Unexpected Jam and GBJam 8, but I missed the deadline for the latter, hence why the game has a Game Boy aesthetic.</p>\n<p>There's only one playable character, four levels, and no audio or story for now because I wanted to get something done in time for the Unexpected Jam, but I plan on adding much more before the rating period ends.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move.
