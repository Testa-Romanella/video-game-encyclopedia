As you can tell is an RPG.<br/></p>\n<p>Made as a joke in 2013 in about 4 weeks using gamemaker. (also practically the first game I ever made)</p>\n<p>If I'm being honest the game is really old and hasn't been updated in a while. We also practically lost the original files of the game.</p>\n<p>UI text in the game doesn't adapt well to new OS systems or to aspect scaling. I figured I might as well give my sins the light of day.</p>\n<p>Game was made\u00a0by all engineers (which I hope explains the 4th grade drawings)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>We made a text tutorial in the game(Oh Gawd).</p>\n<p>But to summarize:</p>\n<p>-You have two resources, sunlight and water</p>\n<p>-Using these, you buy skills by dragging and dropping. Using skills also costs these resources during battle.</p>\n<p>-Every day you have a text event</p>\n<p>-Every day you have a battle event where you have to click abilities to kill enemies.</p>\n<p>- You basically have to survive for like 10 days(I think).</p>\n<p><strong>The game is really hard.</strong> Like we have some OP enemies that exponentially scale if you don't kill them fast enough. Some just straight up troll you.</p>\n<p><strong>So just a forewarning if the game feels Janky.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Kent Phan - Designer/Manager (Me, also an engineer)</p>\n<p>Daniel Sanders - Engineer (The Champ who dealt with our unreasonable requests)<br/></p>\n<p>Khoa Dang - Designer/Artist (The Engineer, that we used as an artist)</p>\n<p>Tri Lam - Character Artist (The artist we hired to make our main character art, which totally clashes with the rest of our enemy/background art)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/17207d404562495dd2a4a23883efa121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KentCPhan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
