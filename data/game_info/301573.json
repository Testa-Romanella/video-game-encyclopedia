Neither of them can jump but they can exchange momentum through solid surfaces. That'll have to suffice as you help them make their way through dozens of puzzle-platforming challenges.<br/><br/>Each level contains several pairs of switches that must all be turned on before you're allowed to exit. You're only allowed to flip two switches at a time so you'll have to think strategically to solve each puzzle.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-10T21:50:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8a223c0bbd0e73d6934c171246847e5.jpg", "website": "https://deleveledgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 643, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 124, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Web", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["ToasterFuel"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["ToasterFuel"], "esrb_rating": null}
