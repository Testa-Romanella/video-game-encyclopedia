I will move on to another jam and learn from this one got a bit bored working on it. Thumbs would touch the ground and lose health and die was the idea. Player controller code was interesting with arrow keys for one player and awsd as player 2. Very happy to have completed a jam, Yeah!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/873/873baf0dc47a6e30852e0fb9a47cdc72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["doshiegamestudios"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
