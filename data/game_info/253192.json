Notice that the audio file is prepared ahead of time because this is a rhythm game and making music in 10 minute is impossible.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>A slightly more polished version of the game (better graphics and score text) is also available as downloadable files.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d55/d558f35ec97c68b2bf1c4a65cf5def7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Southocean"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
