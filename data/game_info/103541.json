We're WorldOne and we would like to present \u201cWhere\u2019s My Money?\u201d, a comedy adventure in modern times made with RPG Maker VX Ace. Please consider that this game is currently under development, and this is just a demo version that still needs work.<br/>This game has been in development for two years and now that we are reaching a concrete state, we have decided to show a demo (in progress) in order to receive feedback on our progress before moving to next stages of development. We plan to reach crowdfunding in the near future to be able to finish this game as for now, this is an example of what \"Where's My Money?\" can become.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Social Media:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Twitter:</strong>\u00a0https://twitter.com/OneOrbis<br/><strong>YouTube:</strong>\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-_6XkNC5lxTZxcvinh_q6w<br/><strong>Facebook:</strong>\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/WorldOneGames</p>\n\n\n<p>Players will fill in the shoes of a protagonist that can\u2019t ever have things going right, the story begins when your landlord threatens to kick you out because you haven\u2019t paid the rent yet. Screwed into unemployment by a former colleague and never paid the salary deserved, you decide to do what anyone else would do\u2026 March to the former workplace and get what\u2019s yours (some people would just get a lawyer or go to the police, let\u2019s not get sidetracked here). The problem here starts when every time you try to reach your destination, random series of events will always keep you from achieving your goal.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>As the week progresses you will find yourself in awkward situations, to solve them you\u2019ll will need the help of other characters. You may keep making decisions heading for the money, or realize that it is not about money only, but about those who are always with us, sticking out to help us even with their own flaws. With the development of events, you will also meet \u201cspecial\u201d characters with different personalities that are romanceable. These characters have been written in a manner that matches your fondness, with different traits none of them are the same, your relation with the love plot you choose will depend on your behavior during quests of the game. The game will have multiple endings, where the affecting factors will be who did you ended with (if any), how did you behave in situations where you could choose between helping others or gaining money and how willing were you when it came to help others.</p>\n<p>This is a comedic story that will have more serious sections of a medieval past of the protagonist, where a more fantasy short story will be told about the life of a knight and a princess to expand the universe of the game. This game takes place in the city of Riverfall, which is a British city that has descended from medieval times, surviving plagues, famine and wars, never losing the city\u2019s spirit (and we just made that last part up).<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>Most of the graphics are custom made for a better immersion of the player in the setting, we also use a custom soundtrack that matches the game's aesthetics, courtesy of the very talented\u00a0Schematist. The full version of the game will include several minigames for the player to enjoy himself, but for the moment, there is only one inserted into the game (\"Clover &amp; Glover\").\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Here are a few more of the game's features:</p>\n<ul><li>Character customization, where the player can choose a gender, ethnicity, clothes and haircuts, with the last two being changeable through stores in-game, (For the moment not all of the variations of outfits and hair are not available because they are based on the game's story).\u00a0</li><li>A journal for the player to check current tasks.\u00a0</li><li>Collectibles that further develop the lore of the game.\u00a0</li><li>A functional traffic system.</li><li>A mini map and a full map of the game's city.</li><li>Fast travel</li></ul>\n<p>We aim for the full game to have 7+ hours of content, as some of you might notice from the demo, it can take more than half of an hour to be completed due to the amount of content so far.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>WorldOne is a small indie dev studio in Angola, composed by two people, it consists of Ronnie Guerra, programmer and graphical artist for most of the scenarios of the game, among other things and Daniel Elias who is the writer and artist for the characters in the game, this is the first game being designed by the team.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is mainly the work of the people of WorldOne, but we also owe a great deal to many others who have directly or indirectly contributed, among those many people from the RPG Maker community, of which we're still making a list of individual names to write here.</p>\n<p>The soundtrack of this videogame is the work of the very talented artist Schematist.
