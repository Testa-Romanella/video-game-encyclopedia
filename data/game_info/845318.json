No loot boxes, no micro transactions, no season passes?<br/><br/><strong>Get ready for a Zen-like experience</strong><br/>Doodle Taxi's main thing is being a chill taxi driving simulator game. Of course there is a little gimmick and story on top of that. But that doesn't change this game meant to blow off some steam. If you don't want to invest hours to start enjoying a game, this one what you have been looking for. Enjoy this beautiful world as you cruise around and color it in! Whether you want to drive around like a maniac or just chill out and listen to the bumping soundtrack, this is a great pick up and play driving game!<br/><br/><br/><h3>A GOOFY STORY</h3><br/>What's the worst thing that could happen to a modern day Taxi Driver? Not getting paid? Get mugged? No. A cabbie can get cursed by a witch and lose his sight. Just because we live in a modern day, do you really think that witches were extinct? Well I was thinking the same thing, so I thought that might be a good story to put in my game.<br/><br/><h3>WHAT THE CAR!?</h3><br/>This is a car game obviously. And we should have cars, more than one. Unlockable, locked behind some in-game currency. But don't worry, you can earn all these without spending real money. I can't design these complex loot boxes and in-app purchases anyway.<br/><br/><h3>SHORT STORY, LONG</h3><br/>Ok I know this is not an expression. At least this is not correct one. But I wanted to point out that this game is a pretty short experience compared to others. Of course you can play forever, there is a high replayability. But playthrough will be pretty short.<h3>A BANGER SOUNDTRACK</h3>When I say banger soundtrack, be sure that I'm telling truth. I'm so glad that so many talented indie musicians donated their awesome songs into this one, including;<br/>Abstraction / Cat Temper / Obsidian Contraption / Colourful Energy / Dragon-Orb / Vercin Featherix / No Lake / Nelson &amp; Bernstein / SparraLIMB<br/><br/><strong>Wrapping up</strong><br/>So drive your car fast and careful, keep that 'being a good driver' meter at green, deliver customers on time. That's the name of the game. Thanks for reading so far and I wish you to enjoy my little game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T04:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cff/cff8941867338cd755a906b34dbdf81c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Metgan Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Metgan Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
