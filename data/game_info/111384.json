Through possession, the trickster gains \u00a0combat, destruction and evasion capabilities which they can exercise on the grunt city, a playground for chaos. The characters the player encounters each have their own unique combat and movement capabilities that the player combats against and gains access to when the character is possessed by the player. The goal of the game is for the player to experiment in this environmental 'playground', trying out different characters and exploring the environment to find the 5 totems that must be destroyed!</p>\n<p>Godsend is a 'capstone' project by Patchwork Games, a team of 4th year Honours Bachelor of Game Design students at Sheridan College in Canada.
