Enter the dungeon as Red Hood and try to take down as many enemies as possible before they get you, the only catch is each time you get a kill the enemies will mix up their type.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each time you die go back for more action and keep improving your high score.</p>\n\n\n\r\nTutorial:\r\n<p>Click to perform a dash to your cursor, attacking any enemies in your path. (Tip: Click behind the enemy to slice through it, clicking on it may cause you to stop early and not get the kill.)</p>\n<p>ESC to pause/resume the game and to close the credits screen.</p>Enemy Types:<p>Bat: Fires a projectile at the player but never will approach into melee range.</p><p>Wolf Mutant: Slow moving and only attacks within melee range but attacks multiple times quickly if you don't escape.</p><p>Slime: Melee only but has a 1/3 chance of splitting into two smaller slimes.</p>\n<p>Credits in game. Mac and PC builds available.<br/></p>\n<p>Please check out my first commercial release CHASM coming this spring.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T08:50:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f796510e7f380789a278c2f8d9d1f2a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BanceDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
