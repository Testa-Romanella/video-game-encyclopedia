Knock the creatures back into the portals they came from!</p>\n<p>Use WASD to control Mushy's movement, and use IJKL to control Swampy's movement. Both characters will automatically attack monsters coming at them. When Mushy or Swampy attacks, their own mana bar is filled up by a little. When the mana bar is full, you can unleash a powerful Super Attack that automatically shoots enemies back to their portals. (Press E for Mushy's Super Attack, or press U for Swampy's.)</p>\n<p>If a monster gets past either character, the temple will take a little damage. If too many enemies get by, the temple will collapse, and it'll be game over!</p><p><strong>CREDITS:<br/></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Grant Ross: </strong>Composer, Sound Designer, Programmer</li><li><strong>Jimmy Liu: </strong>2D/3D Artist/Animator, Programmer</li><li><strong>Valeria Trevino:\u00a0</strong>Illustrator </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:58:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70cf96bfe68d47b2eb468bdea056c4c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["jimjimthebard", "Grant R."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
