On the fartful dim twilight hours of August 21th, 2021, the stupendous Raeleus and Peanut Panda rejoiced for shooing maxkcy, because maxkcy was slightly more gorgeous then them, and they were envious.\u00a0So, they\u00a0join their butts together, to commenced a party. In a frivolous frenzy, they splashed their butthole goop everywhere in their room, and marveled at how they\u00a0banished maxkcy. Maxkcy would have\u00a0condemned them of their wicked sins, and would have warned them of what could happen if they continued this path. However it was too late, they had BANNED maxkcy. Some of the butthole goop splashed into their neural network quantum computer machine. But no worries because Dragon Qween would clean the place squeaky and spotless.\u00a0But, unbeknownst to them, Maxkcy had placed behind a petri dish deep inside their computer machine\u00a0&amp; 4 months later\u00a0some of the butt hole goop became sentient and slimy. Raeleus promptly called it \"James\", once he recognized its presence and power. Raeleus was too afraid to destroy James, and was frankly powerless. Now, on this day\u00a0James the Butt Hole Slime is ready to leave the gestation period and escape into the world. James will destroy the world!\u00a0But James still needs to get out. Just beware of the ghost of Raeleus, and Peanut Panda, he has an image of the butt goop on his shirt, yea,\u00a0stay clear of that guy. BTW merry Christmas. .. no actual offence intended, i hope you found this story funny, and will enjoy the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong>\u00a0pressing\u00a0spacebar pretty much does everything...eh, unclinging from the cooling fan.\u00a0Arrow keys to move the sight of view. Help James The Butt Hole Slime get out of\u00a0the computer by clinging on to the cooling fans, and climbing all way to the top and leaking out through\u00a0of the top cover. There is a box2d bug not on my end as a dev. the spinning of the fans slows down when game is pause, resized. so click back and start a new game. from menu if it is slow. libgdx devs fix this issue, i submitted an issue request already.</p>\n<p>And if after 5 mins without successful tries to get out, James The ButtHole Slime gains super powers. It's the dev's debug controls. figure out the keys if you are really bad at this game.  sorry just realized that right crtl doesnt work in browser? anyway, I am able to win, so you can too!<strong>\u00a0please play this game in full-screen.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>This game is made for the Dec 2021 libGDX game jam 19 theme \"Slime and Machine\"\u00a0... BTW no actual offence intended.\u00a0Thank you libGDX for such a wonderful time. Anyway\u00a0this will like be my last libGDX game for a long time. Thank you for everything this past year. libGDX FOR THE WIN!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:33:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2aa/2aa1f74ee98c6ec162fabec8561e88d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maxkcyfun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
