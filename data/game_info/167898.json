You and your enemies have 2 bars an health bar (the red one) and the power bar (the yellow one) everything you do takes out power and your enemies also loose power, when you kill an enemy he will give you the same power he had when he died, some enemies drop a health pack, to attack you should mantaign pressed the left mouse button and you can also slow down time by clicking in the right mouse button although that feature is only usefull if you wanna walk faster than the enemies this also takes a lot of energy.<br/>Any way we hope you like the game</p>\n\n<p>ludum dare page :\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/drain-2/edit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f06/f062bf59bda73d4fd5a011a22e045cab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Team_Fractured"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
