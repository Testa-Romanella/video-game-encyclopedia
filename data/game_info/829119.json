Can you escape with your life?<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls: Mouse-only</p>\n<p>Specifically: Click on options and buttons to select them; click to skip through sequences; and click-and-drag the buttons of the sliders in the options menu to move them.</p>\n\n<p>Content Warnings:</p>\n<ul><li>Death</li><li>Violence (described)</li><li>Undeath</li><li>Burial</li><li>Entombment</li><li>Sickness (mentioned)</li><li>Abuse (non-specific, mentioned)</li><li>Robbery (mentioned)</li></ul>\n\n<p>Note: At least one bug remains, I believe! Still, I believe that it's a fairly minor one, involving the sprite not always ending up in its proper position if one rapidly clicks through a sequence.</p><p>Note too: At time of writing the Windows build has not yet been tested; only the Linux build has. Still, the latter seems to work, and I expect that the former should do so, too. ^^;<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T07:59:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/667a5a47b06c2f651e368e3081f7fe7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Ian Eborn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
