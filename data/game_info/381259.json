(the previous night i had built the jumping player and the level \"generator\".)\u00a0i wasn't actively thinking about these bullet points, and <strong>a lot of what i'm saying here is only retroactively applying the pattern</strong> of my \"pressure\" bullet points\u00a0to this one particular game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:26:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/551/551564d28158b0fe27007e84033b5f23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Droqen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
