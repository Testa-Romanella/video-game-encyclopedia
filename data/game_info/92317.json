Get it now FREE \u00a0here for Android and here for \u00a0iOS version.</p><p><strong>The Bear's \u00a0Black Heart:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Race against hunger and increasing cold as you find food and interact with a host of characters.<br/></p>\n<p>Everybody you meet has unexpected replies to the choices you make and both their and your actions can be a little nutty sometimes! Can you reason with Eric the Actor? Can you seek directions from David Bowie's ghost?</p>\n<p>Made in under two weeks for Wizard Jam 4, this game was a blast to make and maybe we'll revise it after some feedback.</p>\n<p>Developed by Abban Dunne  in Unity with art by Bob created in Affinity Designer .The music is by Broke for Free.</p>\n<p>We built this as part of Wizard Jam 2016. If you're interested in game development you can also check out the development log here.</p>\n<p><strong>CHANGELOG</strong></p>\n<p><strong>v1.1.0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Added status multipliers</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><strong>fast &amp; slow / noble &amp; mingy / optimist &amp; pessimist / satisfied &amp; ravenous / fresh &amp; stale / abundance &amp; famine</strong> - Will now add or remove in increments.</li> <li><strong>reversed</strong> - Will only apply when the multiplier is an uneven number. So now it will toggle if you get it multiple times.</li> <li><strong>flatulence</strong> - You fart more often when the status stacks up. (never thought I'd be typing that)</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Tweaked heart and food from choices</strong></p>\n<p>Now the amount of food you get and heart you lose makes more sense when compared to the decisions. It will also list that you got them along with the status effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Show buttons for all choices</strong></p>\n<p>Now all the choices will be shown, but some of them will be inactive depending on how dark your heart is.</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed Spelling</strong></p>\n<p>I fixed some of the bad spelling mistakes and rewrote a little to make stuff line up with the decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\n<p>Eating squirrels makes your heart a little blacker. More squirrels spawn.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice rooms</strong></p>\n<p>Added a max level counter to force a choice room if one hasn't appeared in a while.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea2/ea2257292b5bbc6fe4cf29831adb84db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Big Bad Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
