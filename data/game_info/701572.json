I am also a blonde kid with green eyes. I live in Xodias City and I go to the school of Xorie. We are in February 2018. Right now, I'm in the yard because it's the morning break. I'm watching Eloi and Bobby climb into the playground when, suddenly, I look at Nana, who stands a little further.</p>\n<p>\u00a0[\u2026]\u00a0</p>\n<p>I look at Nana and I see her eyes widen in terror. She screams something, then the pain pierces my body. My vision blurries. I collapse on the ground.\"</p>\n\n<p>Alex thought he was a kid like many others, but that was before he became a <strong>Rift Breaker</strong>. Now, he must protect his city by fighting monsters coming out of \"Rifts\", strange cracks of light, with the help of <strong>Lily, Nana and Aim\u00e9</strong>.</p>\n<p>---------------------</p>\n<p>Alan: Rift Breakers is an linear story written with Twine and a remake of A.L.A.N., made with RPG Maker.
