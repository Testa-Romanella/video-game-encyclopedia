It is an action horror game known as Dracula's Castle. Like many people, I discovered Dave Microwaves Games\u00a0through 3AM at the Krusty Krab, which I loved, but Dracula's Castle was one of my absolute favorite games he's made and was a major inspiration for me as I developed the desire to make my own games.\u00a0 Given that it appears he will not be finishing it, I thought, as a big fan of the game, I would try my hand at creating a remake of it, both as a tribute to the original, and also with the hope of making a full finished version.\u00a0 For the most part,\u00a0I am keeping to the spirit (no pun intended)\u00a0and layout of the original, but thought it would be fun to add some new things too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0This is an Alpha version containing Floor 1 and Floor B1. There is about 15 minutes of gameplay depending on skill level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aab0f7dc509e7902f3d07a89bab63af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WhizmageGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
