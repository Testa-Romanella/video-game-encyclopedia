The theme of the Jam is\u00a0\"Out of Control\".<br/></p>\n<p>A notorious hacker has infected your system with malware! Take control of your computer by zapping the annoying popups, but beware... <strong>the hacker has taken control of your mouse!</strong></p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY:\r\n<p>Zap malware popups as fast as you can!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>The hacker has taken control of your mouse! At any time, they may:</p>\n<ul><li>Invert your mouse axis.</li><li>Move your mouse to another position.</li><li>Adjust the mouse sensitivity.</li><li>Move popups away from you.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each open malware popup consumes one unit of <strong><em>memory</em></strong>.
