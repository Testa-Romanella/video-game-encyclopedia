You have sworn to rescue her in your Gunstorm, the last fighter craft of the old league.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGunstorm II is an arena space-shooter with bags of playability, character, pretty weapons, and lots of fun. The plot-based action takes you to five different worlds, from the caves of Marrowmar to the The Deadly Asteroid Field of Rodix Draconium. Play to unlock new arcade sub-games, including the classic game from Gunstorm game but with the all-new Gunstorm II weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEight wonderful weapons: Cannon, Laser, Trident, Protonites, Ion Rifle, Flamer, Nova Rockets, and the Phoenix, plus the classic Spider Bombs. You can carry all at once, and the balanced combat means that you get more ammo the more you shoot. Plus enjoy the fantastic Gunstorm soundtrack sung by Tor James Faulkner.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game playability is perfectly balanced, starting from slow and easy, and rising to match your skills as you play, and like the first Gunstorm game you can play with mouse (both 'classic', or follow-the-cursor mode), X-Box style game controller, or keyboard. Lots of game options allow you to set your own difficulty level, and choose between a fixed or random game for infinite playability.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSteam achievements track your progress per game-world, and you can continue the main campaign at any time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T07:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703b6e47c36b2bb4d58d629a07d231b2.jpg", "website": "https://www.marksheeky.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cornutopia Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Cornutopia Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
