Once the ball is in hand the multiplier starts \u2014 keep it going by traveling around the arena and up through the ramps. When you feel the time is right (or you can\u2019t stand the pressure any longer) clock in your points by scoring a goal. <br/><br/><h3>DEFEAT THE MACHINE... AND ITS MINIONS</h3>In single-player mode, your opponents will be bent on overtaking possession and blocking your goals. Use your wits to evade them. Brute force in the form of tackles and grabs works too. <br/><br/><h3>WHOLE DIFFERENT BALL GAMES</h3>The nature of the ball changes with the game mode, opening up whole new styles of play. In Runner mode, the ball has legs and will walk towards your goals. In Pinball mode, you\u2019ll be contending with gravity. In Radio mode, you can freakishly steer the ball from across the board. <br/><br/><h3>COMPETE WITH FRIENDS OR STRANGERS</h3>Battle players across the world for coveted high score titles. You can also play Arcade Sundown locally with friends! Customize according to the squad\u2019s preference \u2014 play for points or for goals \u2014 and go head to head in 2v2 teams mode or in a classic free-for-all.<h3>JOIN THE DEVS!</h3>Come hang out on our Discord, where we chat about the game, announce tournaments, and generally have a nice time.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T04:33:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b73/b73fcd864aae50aa5b9f7e9c63306f52.jpg", "website": "https://www.thefullyarcade.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Fully Arcade"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Fully Arcade"], "esrb_rating": null}
