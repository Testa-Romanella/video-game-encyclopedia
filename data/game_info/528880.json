Your job is to choose how hard the questions the players get asked.<br/></p>\n<p>You earn money by getting a high viewership rating, which is calculated by how far the player has gone through the questions without losing and by how challenging the questions are to him.</p>\n<p>You lose money on several occasions:</p>\n<p>1. Each time a new player has entered you lose $50,000 (running a game show is a costly business).</p>\n<p>2. When you get a negative viewership rating.</p>\n<p>3. When a player withdraws with the money at the appropriate stage.</p>\n<p>4. When a player wins the 1 Million dollars question - that's when you're in real trouble!</p>\n\n<p>IMPORTANT: Your Windows/AntiVirus may prevent you from downloading or running the game. I assure you it is safe to run the EXE.
