The creatures and lab's system got your team separated and now you have to save your companions before leaving or leave without them.</em>\r\n---------------------------\r\nGame made for Gdevelop's Game Jam, in 6 days and something, cuz I started a bit later.<br/>Since the theme of the jam is Pets/Companions, the more you save team members, the easier it gets to beat the final boss!\r\nFights between player and monsters are decided with a quick time/precision game.\r\nThe exit of the lab is represented by a door with an \"E\" in the middle, it takes you to the boss.\r\nIt has random tiles every time it loads, the characters and everything was made during the Jam. It might have bugs, due to the time it took to be made, but it's done :)\r\n-------------------------\r\n<em>If you also like making games, please check my FREE and public domain assets!
