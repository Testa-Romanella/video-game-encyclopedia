C# was used for the entirety of the scripting for the project and coded by myself. The scripting included movement, gravity/mass scaling, buoyancy, animation, kill box, and camera follow to tie the game together smoothly. All arts assets (Frog, Cherry, Tree, and Ground Tile) are from \"Sunny Land\" provided by the Unity Asset Store. Background images were pulled from various artists.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/050/05070eea508a448b1986560b684de52e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Peyton Breech"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
