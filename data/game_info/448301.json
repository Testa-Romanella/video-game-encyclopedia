They are thought to have one of the most complex visual systems in the animal kingdom and can see many more colors than humans can. Furthermore, one species can use their appendages to \u201cpunch\u201d their prey and crack their shells with the force of a .22 caliber bullet! These two features of the mantis shrimp led to the view switch and boost mechanics respectively. The \u201cplot\u201d is inspired by Ratatouille.</p>\n<p>\tThis was my first game jam and I had lots of fun making the game! Hope you have some fun playing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\tMantis shrimp facts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp</p>\n<p>\tcupo games - design, code, art, music</p>\n<p>\tsofa - art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:16:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f1/5f17cad383a374aacfaf2344bc6b1bda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cupo games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
