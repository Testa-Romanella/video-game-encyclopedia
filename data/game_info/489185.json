One devoid of life, without light. There are very few doors into this world and even fewer people who have the key. Life was never meant to exist in that world. And when life comes into it, that life starts to break down into something else. Something unrecognizable. Get out before you turn into that thing. But don't let it out...<br/><br/>An incomplete game we created for the summer slow jam, while we didn't get as far in production as we would have liked the main purpose for us was to get back into game development after a short break. I mainly used this as a way to try some things I hadn't done before and it was worth it for that at least, and\u00a0maybe you can see what our idea was!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T07:07:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b1/7b1a96bac5cb2e3796ddf34b505e7aa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J.Anthracite"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
