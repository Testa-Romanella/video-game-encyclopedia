It's an arcade-y game in scope for now, but hopefully will expand later in\u00a0scale, if further developed.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>A/D or Left/Right Arrows to Steer Ship<br/>W/S or Up/Down Arrows to control acceleration (shown by player Sails)<br/>Spacebar Key, or\u00a0Left Mouse button to fire standard cannonball<br/>X Key, or\u00a0Right Mouse button to fire (special) cannonball spread</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Objective</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Kill all enemy ships within the map, within a limited amount of time. Without being sunk.</li><li>If you kill all enemy ships on map? Then you move on to the next day\u00a0(stage);<ul><li>With any time remaining being added to the time limit on the next day (stage).</li></ul></li><li>If you get sunk or time runs out, then it's game over. And you'll have to start again at day 1.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Inspirations<br/></strong>Outside the obligatory \"Sid Meier's Pirates!\" I'd also cite in terms of 'feel', Ace Combat. Especially if I\u00a0expand to include many features. Least of which different types of enemies, <em>BOSSES</em>. And alternative Special attacks, with limited ammo!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T01:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60f/60fa011323b847e41a74730ef3286192.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andrew Letailleur"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
