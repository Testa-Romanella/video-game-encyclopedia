Made with Godot, first time use and fell in love :)<br/></p>\n<p>In this game you have to defend your computer system against malicious packets coming from your network interface. Game is currently at prototype stage. Lots of content couldn't be made. <br/></p><p><strong>Resource collection: </strong>You can spawn resource collection \r\nbuilding (malloc) by clicking on main building and placing the building.\r\n After you spawn this building you need to assign a unit (memcpy) by \r\nselecting one and right clicking on the malloc building.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning: </strong>game lacks proper path finding, so try to play with units in a way to not make them stuck :)<br/></p>\n<p>You can move camera around with W A S D keys or going edge of the screen. You can also combine both for faster navigation.</p>\n<p>You can multi select units by drag and drop or single click to choose only one unit.</p><p>You can click on ground do deselect units.<br/></p>\n<p>Game score determined by how long you survive with most  kills. It starts slow but they come very quickly. So you need high APM to survive :)</p>\n<p>Tools used;<br/>* Godot 3.1<br/>* Blender 3.8<br/>* GIMP<br/>* Krita</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/68847cfdf365c3237b0b26bae2153480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["codetorex"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
