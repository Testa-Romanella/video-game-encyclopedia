For now, it's a prototype with the basic mechanics and art.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>- left click to move</p><p>- space to lay down</p><p>- left shift to flip over<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T08:20:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e34/e34067fa2a5bec2f0794753efe88ffd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Feral Poodles", "Alexis Urbain-Racine", "Ashkey01"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
