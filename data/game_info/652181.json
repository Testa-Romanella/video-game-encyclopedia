{"id": 652181, "slug": "submerged-gallery", "name": "Submerged Gallery", "name_original": "Submerged Gallery", "description": "<p>Explore a virtual gallery of submechanophobia in a retro computing environment. Although this isn't really a \"game\", there are two endings. The goal is to simply take your time enjoying experiencing the creepy images, captions, and music (feat. the retro PC MT-32)! This was created for the Haunted PS1 Summer of Shivers Jam (Summer Jam 2021).<br/><br/>Pro Tips: This game should display ideally on a MOBILE PHONE, but should also play in-browser for Windows or other platforms. I have also provided a downloadable version. Does it seem like you're stuck? You may just need to click/tap to let the game know you have read the text and are ready for the next thing. On a desktop or laptop, use F11 to trigger or escape fullscreen.<br/></p>\n<p>All images are \"found art\" and I wanted to be sure to provide the appropriate credits and \"metadata\". Some is included in the game options, but I include the full credits below.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n| General credits |\r\n-------------------\r\n &gt; Adventuron engine and Bamburgh in-game font by Chris Ainsley\r\n &gt; CRT emulation process by MrMoTarius\r\n &gt; Pixelation via ordered dithering in GIMP 2.10.10\r\n---------\r\n| Audio |\r\n---------\r\n &gt; 11 Swimming - Slow 02.wav by 14GPanskaValaChristoffer (28 Feb 2018), freesound.org/s/420169, Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)\r\n &gt; 366159__dcsfx__underwater-loop-amb.wav by DCSFX (31 Oct 2016), freesound.org/s/366159, Creative Commons 0 (Public Domain)\r\n &gt; seagulls by Eelke (01 Feb 2012), freesound.org/s/144835, Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)\r\n &gt; Luftrum's free field recordings for most of the background ambient hydrophone sounds and ocean waves, luftrum.com/free-field-recordings/\r\n &gt; Music and other sounds by Eldritch Renaissance Cake (Chris Hay)\r\n----------\r\n| Images |\r\n----------\r\n &gt; \"Title/Thumbnail/Ending\" photo by Sander van der Wel; modified under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic License; commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lago_di_Resia_(Reschensee)_(14990159251).jpg\r\n &gt; \"Underwater Staircase\" photo by Francesco Ungaro; free to use, no attribution required; https://www.pexels.com/photo/view-of-wooden-steps-taken-underwater-3634369/\r\n &gt; \"Beach Serpent\" photo by Yves LC; Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported; commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St-Brevin-serpent1.jpg\r\n &gt; \"Sunken Statues\" photo and sculpture exhibit credit to Jason DeCaires Taylor; https://www.underwatersculpture.com/works/underwater/\r\n &gt; \"Drowned Crosses\" photo by Rene Weterings (instagram @rene_weterings_underwaterphoto); copyright Rene Weterings, modified and used with permission solely for inclusion in this project; https://www.instagram.com/p/CKLa79EBj79/\r\n &gt; \"Abandoned Container\" photo credit to NOAA/MBARI; free to use with credit; https://sanctuarysimon.org/dbtools/photo-library/id/4982\r\n &gt; \"Dragon Teeth\" photo taken by Gatien Cosendey (instagram @gatiencosendey); copyright Gatien Cosendey, modified and used with permission solely for inclusion in this project; https://gatiencosendey.photography/gallery/lake/#jp-carousel-342", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T01:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47c/47c7d392dd72c8822da122ca0b581007.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["EldritchRenaissanceCake"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
