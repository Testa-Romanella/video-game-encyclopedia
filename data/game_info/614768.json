This communal witnessing of the transition to \u2018the other side\u2019 is devised to produce a solidarity so emphatic that it bridges Europe and Asia, fulfilling the theorist Aleksandr Dugin\u2019s agenda of a Eurasian empire.</p>\n<p>We are describe these themes and theories as \u2018grey areas\u2019 of contemporary thought: considered with suspicion by the majority, ignored by scientists, then left in the hands of commentators and politicians who exploit them to populist ends. The grey areas, for all their factual inaccuracy, have the potential to be a uniting force, and are thereby latent tools for generating power. The House of Dugin is both a criticism of these political machinations, and an attempt to reappropriate the philosophical territory of magical realism.</p>\n<p>The House of Dugin on Riga Biennial of Contemporary Art\r\n</p>\n<p>The House of Dugin - Transmedia Storytelling Kit\r\n</p>\n<p>The House of Dugin - FB Community\r\n</p>\n\n<ol><li>Buy personal code and secret link to DeadVision App\r\n</li><li>Install DeadVision App on your phone\r\n</li><li>Enter personal code</li><li>Sit back and witness<br/>\n</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:41:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13b/13bb725fb0566135ba19962c2a748ae0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Mikhail Maksimov"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
