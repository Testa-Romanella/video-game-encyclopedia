As the title suggests, you are walking through valleys and finding your way to the end of the game, if you go through the \u201cwrong route\u201d there is an EPIC\u00a0surprise on the end of that path. The large signs scattered around either help you or confuse you, and you decide what they mean.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first 3D\u00a0Unity game created for a uni assignment. The game is literally meant to be a joke (hence trash game) <strong>so have fun and\u00a0\u00a0take a stroll!</strong>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:07:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6a/f6aa08393e56bf8dfede7b9717dc4a24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yuuunmi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
