The assignment for the game was that we had to make a retro game like Pac-man or Tetris and give it a twist. We also had to make sure it would be fun for streamers to play. So with these objectives we came up with the idee to combine three games into one fun chaotic game. The three games we combined were Centipide, Pac-man and Snake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You as the player would need to control this snake like parade through a maze like structure. Once you get hit you could split into two players that you now have to control both. We added a few enemies that try to kill you by hitting you with their attacks. There are 6 levels to explore (including a tutorial level). Each level gets increasingly more difficult, so see if you can finish them all.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in the code take a look at the GitHub. This project I was most proud of the A* algorithm I implemented for the enemies. If your interested in that piece of code you can\u00a0look here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T18:56:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/094e52cb7716f01125e2b6da3e048536.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheCyberOne"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
