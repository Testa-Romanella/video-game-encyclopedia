You can set up an arcade lounge, a fruit market, a lolly shop, or anything in between! You can fill the walls with paintings, carpet the floor with rainbows, make a huge maze, or do just about anything! It's completely up to you!<br/><br/>- The Farm;<br/>This is the open wilderness. You can gather natural resources, plant orchards of trees and fields of crops, make a little village, or change the terrain in any way you please! Decorate and carve the land into the perfect paradise!<br/><br/>- The Factory;<br/>This is where your stock can be made.
