{"id": 609589, "slug": "rite-of-aedhra", "name": "Rite of Aedhra", "name_original": "Rite of Aedhra", "description": "<p><strong>Rite of Aedhra</strong> <br/>is a single-player stealth adventure game set in the dark fantasy world of Aedhra. As the protagonist, you will have to evade dangerous enemies and solve intricate puzzles, in order to perform an ancient ritual meant to resurrect a god. The game features five levels to explore, two enigmatic puzzles, lots of enemies that will try to kill you, and branching dialogue to learn more about its desolated world. <br/><br/>We have developed Rite of Aedhra as the course project for the Game World Design course at ITU (Spring 2021), and as such it was scoped as a prototype for a potentially bigger game, while still showcasing the vastness of the world that we carefully crafted. In this report, we will discuss its production process, outline major design decisions, argue for their theoretical foundations, and describe what direction the project might take in the future.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Developed by:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Andrea Trevisin: Tech Lead, Programmer,\u00a0SFX\u00a0Designer</p>\n<p>El\u0151d Vizi: Producer, Lead Level Designer</p>\n<p>Johan Lund Neergaard: Lead Game Designer, Programmer</p>\n<p>Jonathan Emil Mogensen: Lead narrative Designer, Art Lead, Programmer</p>\n<p>Stoyan Georgiev Germanov: AI Programmer<br/><br/><strong>In-Game Images:</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:47:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebb21309ff1dbb36dba58b80fc1d3718.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stoyan", "KB", "vizielod", "MoJoE", "Gebuz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
