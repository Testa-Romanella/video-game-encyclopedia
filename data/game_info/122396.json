The artifact, the Holy Sauce, brought prosperity to the Pizza people. But everything changed when the Kale King unleashed his vegetable army on the unsuspecting Pizzas, in a mad quest to take the Holy Sauce for himself.</p><p>The vegetable army made off with the Holy Sauce, and left the Pizza village in ruin and flame. But from these flames a hero emerged. A slice of Pizza determined to take back what was lost, and avenge his people...</p><p>PizzaTales is a top-down shooter that takes inspiration from the combat mechanics of classic Doom. What does that mean to us? It means fast paced combat, a multitude of weapons at your disposal, and a diverse set of enemies (who can be gibbed, of course). There are 5 areas in the game, each with 4 levels, and culminating in a boss fight. Boss fights are one of the most important aspects of any game, so we have tried to make them as unique and fun as possible.</p><p>Feature list:</p><p>- 20 levels</p><p>- 5 unique boss fights</p><p>- 6 weapons (with no reloading and infinite ammo, cause otherwise it'd be a slower affair)</p><p>- 5 armor/pizza types</p><p>- hats!</p><p>As this game is still in development, we feel it's necessary to tell what remains to be coded into the game. So here's a list of currently missing but soon-to-be-added features:</p><p>- Loading screens</p><p>- Gun sounds</p><p>- Item sounds</p><p>- Key bindings (currently there's two premade key bindings, for qwerty and azerty keyboards)</p><p>UPDATE August 7th 2016</p><p>We've been hard at work at improving PizzaTales, and we have an updated version to give you.
