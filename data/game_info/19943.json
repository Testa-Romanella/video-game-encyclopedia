Variable development curve - some will develop into fearsome warriors, some won't.<br/>\r\n-- Characters form relationships with each other over time, good or bad. Sign them to contracts (or 'pacts') to keep them happy and working for you, or if they\u2019re too greedy, decide when enough is enough and cut them loose. Pacts can include up-front money, yearly money or a percentage of treasure found.<br/>\r\n-- Choose your path: Train your warriors in school and build them up, or draft seasoned hirelings later on to take their place if they don\u2019t cut it.<br/>\r\n-- You set the pace: You can send them on easy missions into realms with limited danger (and maybe limited rewards) but protect your warriors, or send them into more dangerous worlds for more rewards.<br/>\r\n-- Music, detailed graphics and polished UI to draw you into the world.<br/>\r\n-- Engage in unique card-based combat with over 200 different monsters, each with different fighting strength ranges.<br/>\r\n-- Explore ruins, dungeons and open treasure chests, and complete unique grand quests.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChoose your destiny with Redemption today!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-18T11:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d38/d3890be3da93fefef333a5b0d1b94f63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 141, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SimProse Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SimProse Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
