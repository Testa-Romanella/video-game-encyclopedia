It was called \u201cWorld war 3\u201d because... well, Nearly the whole world went to war with each other. It was also the third one of those massive \u201cWorld wars.\u201d During a massive battle, a disease from the east met a disease from the south. In another battle, a disease from the west met a disease from the north. Then, the diseases all met together, no wait\u2026 The diseases from the west and north merged\u2026 So did the ones from the south and east. They spread until the hybrids met each other in a battlefield. An infected soldier was later shot, and killed. We don\u2019t know how, or why, But the disease reacted with the rotting body and then\u2026 As if it was a movie, the body was reanimated, but this time the disease wanted food. A lot more food. With the host, it began to go into populated areas. The disease began to spread. With people believing it was fake, and gathering in groups, the disease spiraled out of control. It had surpassed Covid-19 and the total death count skyrocketed. As the disease grew and mutated, the population of humans diminished. Now only a few humans remain, many working to find a cure\u2026 Others are just trying to survive in this infested land. Now, you must survive. Take your weapon and supplies. You\u2019re going to need it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T03:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/5245315d774a2712b70d5b2a7fc0d90c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Kun"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
