Here I start with a falling ball with gravity and some rotating crosses to change the direction of the ball. Then it'll meet dominos, which triggers another ball to hit another set of dominos. Finally, the last domino falls and hits the seesaw, making the third ball bounce away.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T04:25:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/628/6286e1c6bf6c1d10b8c4f57cef53d394.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yaogeezi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
