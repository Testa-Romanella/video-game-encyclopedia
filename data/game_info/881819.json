The two worlds are connected whenever the people living in the present world dream. Dreamers in the dream world often live in danger created by the chaos makers, so they try to ask people in the present world for help.</p>\n<p>In the present world, only High-recaller can clearly remember what happened in dreamlands and can help the dreamers. But some of these people are just sensitive to dreamlands; they don't believe or care what happens in their dreams. Therefore, the dreamers place their hopes on believers who think dreams are another world.</p>\n<p>But unfortunately, not all believers are willing to give a helping hand to the dreamers. The dream-guardian faction chooses to cooperate with the dreamers to fight the chaos makers; The dream-phobic faction believes that the dream world will affect or even threaten the present world one day, so they choose to study and fight against everyone in the dream world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T13:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f03f562f0172a40dc8ad44266c68c74d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HDYEEE"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
