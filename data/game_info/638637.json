Added glowing effect to all major planets in the Solar System (including Pluto), so that they don't appear too dark when rotating directly at player. Sun naturally emits light, hence the intensity of glowing effect is much stronger;</p>\n<p>2. Disabled directional light and added point light to demonstrate a correct light source (the sun) in the Solar System;</p>\n<p>3. Added actual soundwaves (captured by scientists) each planet generated to the corresponding ones;</p>\n<p>4. Changed Skybox Background so that it looks more like in actual space;</p>\n<p>5. Adjusted both main camera and mini map camera to be able to see the movement of every planet;</p>\n<p>6. Added background soundtrack, free to use;</p>\n<p>7. Added actual material for Comet, so that it does not share material with Jupiter;</p>\n<p>8. Added a planetary ring to Saturn generated by script;</p><p>9. Originally I was planning to make a more acurrate ratio of each planet. However, the Sun and Earth radius ratio is 109:1, when they are represented in game Earth can bearly being seen, the same could be said for other planets. So the idea was scratched in favor of a much more eye-pleasing representation.</p>\n<p>Screenshots:</p>\n<p>Hierarchy</p>\n\n<p>Project Assets:</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T08:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/262/262aed1cfb1be669e013c4430be56365.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Echo Yin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
