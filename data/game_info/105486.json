Ammo and items will be scarce and every bullet counts, so even though you will get to shoot \"things\", you will need to be careful with your items.<br/>There will be various enemies of which some of them will require different methods to eliminate.<br/>Puzzles and secrets is another aspect that will probably be included in the later to come versions.<br/>Lastly, the gameplay may consists of some RPG elements such as skills or perks, but that hasn't yet being decided.<br/><br/>Please keep in mind that I am developing this game only by myself so progress will be slow. Anyone who is interested in helping with art stuff such 3D models, 2D concepts or music let me know.<br/></p>\n\n<p>You can also check the IndieDB , GameJolt and Facebook pages as well.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that I am developing this game only by myself so progress will be slow.
