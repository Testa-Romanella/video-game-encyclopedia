{"id": 117560, "slug": "roll-and-back-again-demo", "name": "Roll and Back Again [DEMO]", "name_original": "Roll and Back Again [DEMO]", "description": "<p><em>Roll and Back Again</em> is my first game and a solo project. It started out as a few hundred lines of Python that I wrote in 2015 to play around with 2D physics. I eventually decided that Python was too slow for the calculations I wanted to do, and began working on a C framework for 2D game engines. For a while I intended to make my first game a <em>Pong</em>/<em>Arkanoid</em> derivative, but by early 2017 the goal had shifted to a puzzle-platformer inspired mainly by <em>Lemmings</em> and <em>The Lost Vikings</em>. That seemed like a less restrictive concept, and was more in line with my taste in games.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>In this demo, the objective in each level is to move the red rollerbot from the leftmost end of the level to the rightmost. Use the Left and Right arrow keys to roll, the spacebar to activate roller abilities and Page Up/Down to switch between rollers. Press \"P\" to pause and unpause. Press F8 to create a checkpoint. Pause, then press F5 to load the latest checkpoint, or use F6 and F7 to browse the checkpoints. Press the Escape key to save and quit.</p>\n<p>Joypads (should) also work. Plug them in <strong>before</strong> you start the game.</p>\n<p>There is a readme file in the downloadable packages that explains all of the above and more, like how to switch display mode. It comes in plain text (readme.txt) and joyful HTML (readme_html/index.html).</p>\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<p>The game only runs on 64-bit Windows and Linux systems. I have only tested it with Debian Linux, feedback about other distributions is welcome. Having a fast processor helps, especially if you want high FPS in 2X fullscreen mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e82/e829c098bf1589a1fa6256b10601fa33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Megaflops"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
