What is the purpose of the Jack-O-Lanterns' existence without Halloween? The battle for the survival of their identity has begun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Jack-O-Lanterns work to make money. They sell the local vegetables from the Halloween world to the humans. This requires them to sort the vegetables they harvest by type. Please, you can help them with that. Oops, there are some people who will interfere with you during the game. Watch out!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA casual puzzle game with the exhilarating feeling of continuous combos and dancing jack-o-lanterns is addictive. Use the lever to switch the flow of vegetables flowing over the conveyor to guide them to the appropriate box. Achieve your goal and get your Halloween back!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can choose the difficulty level by yourself. Even if you choose a stage with a low difficulty level, you will be able to see the event until the end as long as you fulfill the conditions, so it is recommended for light users. By the way, the stage in the promotion video is the middle level of difficulty. Of course, there are more difficult stages available. Even the most confident players will be satisfied with the game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is the story of a slightly strange world that is a little off-axis from our world.
