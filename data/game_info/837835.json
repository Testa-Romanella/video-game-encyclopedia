Lets just say their mission doesn't go as planned and now you must retain as much oxygen as you can. Rush back and forth to patch holes that mysteriously keep popping in your roofless air dome, and protect your oxygen generator from on-coming falling... comets? See how long you'll survive on this foreign planet and beat your own hiscore. You'll probably never beat my hiscore of 18778 THAT'S for sure.</p>\n\n<p>How to Play</p>\n<p>-press F to interact with things on the ship/patch holes</p>\n<p>-hold SHIFT to pick up your generator and release to drop it <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T17:39:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e0/2e0f0aef6fe72b48a2cb9106e8b005e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FunkyFreshTyGamin'"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
