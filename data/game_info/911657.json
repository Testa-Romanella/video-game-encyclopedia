The only person who wasn\u2019t average was the king. That was until he was mysteriously murdered one night while sleeping in the grand hall of his castle. Bongo the knight and his son Bongo jr. traveled to the castle to meet the Princess Zorgo. She had summoned them to find out who had murdered the king.</p>\n<p>        \tAt their meeting, a large, pig-like creature appeared out of thin air. The creature told Princess Zorgo that he had done the murder and that his name was Gaspan. After that Gaspan grabbed Zorgo. Bongo tried to defend the princess, but Gaspan just chopped his head off. Bongo jr. ran over to help his dying father. With an evil laugh, Gaspan disappeared with Zorgo and so the heir to the throne was lost.\r\n</p>\n<p>        \tBongo looked at his son, and stuttered these words, \u201cBongo Junior, you must save Princess Zorgo. The kingdom depends on it!\u201d He began to say something else, but Bongo\u2019s head died. Bongo jr. stood and wiped a tear from his face. He returned to his father\u2019s house and began to stress eat, getting very fat.\r\n</p>\n<p>        \tMeanwhile, Cream Land began to fall into ruin. People couldn\u2019t go through their day without running into one of Gaspan\u2019s minions. One day, an old man came to Bongo\u2019s house. \u201cBongo jr. are you in there?\u201d says the man. Bongo jr. opens the door and swallows a macaron. \u201cYou must meet me near the foot of Dung Mountain.\u201d continues the old man, \u201cThere I will give you something that will help you survive Gaspan\u2019s minions and find Zorgo. Next, the old man leaves. Bongo jr. stares at him as he leaves.\r\n</p>\n<p>        \tThe next day, Bongo jr. decides to go to the foot of Dung Mountain to find the old man and save Zorgo.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T06:38:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fb/1fb4a739379b27378f982a5ffd6fdc14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RJ"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
