Swordsman", "description": "<p><strong>Description:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Despite all odds, you find yourself at the end of your perilous journey. The final challenge you must face is an epic battle with the evil Skeleton Sorcerer who has been plaguing the realm for decades.\u00a0 Power blocks decorate the battle field as you hack and slash you way to victory. Who knows - if used correctly, the blocks could turn the tide of battle in your favor.</p>\n<p>This game was submitted for the GMTK Game Jam 2021. It fits the theme of \"Joined Together\" because you must connect blocks in game to either apply debuffs to your enemy or buffs to yourself. You can sever those connections and remove the buffs/debuffs with your sword. Hence, the dynamic of the game changes depending on which connections are active.</p>\n<p>Key Features:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A new battle mechanic - connecting blocks to grant buffs or debuffs. Your sword can sever any connection though, so be sure not to cut the blue ones!</li><li>Beautiful pixel art aesthetic</li><li>An original soundtrack with 4 songs to keep the battle intense!</li><li>A suite of original new sound effects made by Adam Babcock of TheIndieDream.</li></ul>\n<p>Learn more about TheIndieDream on our profile page!</p>\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n<p>Check out Adam's TikTok!\u00a0https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeuStrdG/\r\n</p>\n<p>Brandon's Github -\u00a0https://github.com/TheIndieDream\r\n</p>\n<p>Brandon's LinkedIn -\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonclyman/\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Interested in how Sorcerer\u00a0Vs\u00a0Swordsman was made?
