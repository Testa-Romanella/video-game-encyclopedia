If I order a coffee, I want it now. If I want a game, I'll opt for a download to get it quicker. If I'm in a court of law, I want the judge to decide my fate based on two random things that I say about myself so I can be on my way.<br/></p>\n<p>Is that still justice? Probably.</p>\n<p>So I don't have time to polish this before Mini Jam 46 ends, but I think it's okay. It's themed around justice, and I used only 5 colours... Of course the code is trash, but you don't receive a gift horse and peek inside its chest cavity do you?</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The instructions are in game too, but just so that you have them here:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press left or right to start. Each person will give two facts about themselves and you can press the left arrow key if you think they're NOT GUILTY of a crime or the right arrow key if you think they are GUILTY.</p>\n<p>Of course this is the law and you might deem someone guilty for being a danger to themselves, for peeing themselves in your court room, or because you're a little cranky. <br/><br/>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:33:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e8906f81a4f71295754940b0d5a0d72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HeyYeh"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
