Don't feel you have to, I'm not relying on the money to live or anything. It'd just be cool to actually make some money from something I made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T05:42:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d24/d241369d51bc7ea6ec1943767d11dbec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["studiohex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
