The second you press the start button, coolness energy flows from whatever your playing it on through your fingertips (we recommend washing hands after that happens). Our studies show that the people who have played \"Space Apes\" are 100% less likely to have been struck by lightning in 1972! Plus, none of the people who have\u00a0rated it highly or donated were killed by car crashes in 2007. Don't risk it: play, like, and (maybe) donate! But <strong>only</strong> if you have money. We don't want to be the jerks responsible for your debt.</p>\r\nControls:\r\nMobile:\r\ntap the left/right side of the screen to move to the left/right\r\npress the bullet button to shoot\r\nPC:\r\nA/D or arrow keys to move left/right\r\nspace to shoot\r\n\r\n\u00a0Please report any bugs in the\u00a0\r\n\\/ comments \\/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T04:20:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/318a854374c3336ec6a388aa7000dc78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sol Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
