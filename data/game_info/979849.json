One where God reigns supreme and though there is conflict in heavenly places, His will is imminent and unstoppable. The game while light-hearted and comedic in tone is backed by the reality that things in the spirit realm are real, our prayers have effect, and that no lesser principality will have its way forever.<br/><br/><strong>Key Features:</strong><br/><ul><li><strong>Synergy: A Turn Based Strategy Combat System</strong><br/>Make use of the powerful synergy system where party members set each other up for success rather than only making the best decision for their own turn. Skills and items both change what synergies are active, and gain additional abilities based on the ones that are!<br/></li><li><strong>A Serious Story With Lighthearted Dialogue</strong><br/>On one hand, we have a story world filled with the mysteries of the spiritual reality we all live in including classic interpretations of spiritual entities.
