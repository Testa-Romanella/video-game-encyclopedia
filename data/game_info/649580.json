End the Core War.</p>\n<p>Revisit your childhood in this years-in-the-making free open-source recreation of Flashbacker's ShellCore Command series, reimagined and overhauled for the modern day. As a \"newborn\" uninfected ShellCore, you will embark on a journey to uncover the secrets of a bizarre - and hostile - world.</p>\n<p>Features (beta-0.0.0):</p>\n<p>* RTS-style combat where your objective is to build defenses in strategic points to eventually destroy the enemy's bases.</p>\n<p>* Two (out of 4) completed episodes of story to play.</p>\n<p>* Parts. You can put parts on your ship to make a cooler ship with more parts, and then make an even cooler ship with even more parts. Need I add more?</p>\n<p>* 38 unique abilities to use in combat.</p>\n<p>* An in-game world editor. The main game world was created using this editor in its entirety!</p>\n<p>* If you join the Discord, you can download several community maps, some of which are larger than the main map!</p>\n<p>Currently, the game only supports Windows, and testing was primarily done\u00a0on Windows 10. Full support for Mac and Linux is planned.\r\n</p>\n<p>GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/rudderbucky/shellcore</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/TXaenta</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T05:25:53", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rudderbucky"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
