Because of the franchise's renowned and well-liked humor, which is based on linguistic skill and wordplay, the game is only available in its native German. There is no English text whatsoever. The platforming levels are still playable without knowledge of the language, but several multiple-choice dialog sequences will be hard to navigate for people who don't understand German.<br/><br/>We are sorry for any inconvenience.
