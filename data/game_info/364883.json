Then one day, a mercenary caught in a storm accidentally reaches the coast of Utopia. From the landscape to the topography, it resembles Utopia Island, but the atmosphere of the desolate island turns out to be a desolate ruin, with the door of hell opening on the island and the demons pouring out, except for some villages. Islanders asking foreign mercenaries to solve the island's problems. Mercenaries must build up their strength and solve the island's problems in their own way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdditional explanation: Utopia is a game that incorporates RPG into the top view ammunition game, and avoiding enemy ammunition and adapting my skills to enemy will be a major gameplay factor. Through the combat system of the above-described game, players can clear quests granted by NPCs and strengthen themselves to strengthen existing skills or acquire new skills. Dungeons with high difficulty will have to think about what skills to use and what tactics to play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T04:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/537/53782afc53c3e6bd425050a92576f135.jpg", "website": "https://spark.adobe.com/page/ucyEynCFKXMk1/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DAX Entertainment", "Iconic Ideaz", "\ubc15\uc9c0\ud6c8", "\uc774\uc9c0\uc6d0", "\uae40\ubbfc\uc6b0", "\uc774\uac74\uc6b0"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DAX Entertainment", "Iconic Ideaz", "Team Utopia"], "esrb_rating": null}
