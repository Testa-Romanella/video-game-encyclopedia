The basis is that you start on a lifeboat because your ship has been damaged and is wrecked on the ocean floor. You need to jump down and retrieve as many materials as you can whilst avoiding whatever lies down below. As of now its an ongoing project which we wish to further polish and fix as there are some known bugs such as collision errors.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls -</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>F - Flashlight</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p>\n<p>ESC - Quit Game</p>\n<p><strong>Credits -</strong></p>\n<p>Jacob Maidens - Programming \\ UE4 implementation</p>\n<p>Bradley Borysenko - 3D modelling</p>\n<p>Jack Townend - Sound Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:09:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba7561025014e80b9e8488936770d01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JMaidens"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
