Use strategy to score points volleyball-style against a crafty AI opponent or a friend in a beautiful and relaxing beach setting.</p>\n<p>The rules mirror those of volleyball:</p>\n<ul><li>Players take turns hitting the ball into each other's field.</li><li>You score when your opponent fails to return the ball to your side of the field in three or fewer hits.</li><li>The AI scores when he and his robot army conquer the globe (just kidding, he scores the same way you do).</li></ul>\n<p>In player vs AI, you use the keyboard. In player vs player, the second player uses the controler (or mind, if they are telekinetic). You can also view the controls by entering the menu.</p>\n<p>Keyboard mapping:</p>\n<ul><li>Escape: main menu</li><li>Arrows: movement</li><li>RShift: jump</li><li>RCtrl: hit</li><li>Enter: dive</li></ul>\n<p>Controller mapping:</p>\n<ul><li>A: jump</li><li>B: hit</li><li>X: dive</li><li>Left thumbstick: movement</li></ul>\n<p>Now hit the beach and score some points!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T09:25:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/930/930a9b11a3eae8b5d996d2a2d7a62441.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlenLoeb"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
