{"id": 5829, "slug": "blockwick-2", "name": "Blockwick 2", "name_original": "Blockwick 2", "description": "Blockwick is a jumbled world full of colorful blocks. Connect all same-colored blocks on the board. Blue with blue, red with red, and so on. Don\u2019t worry about the white crates though\u2014they just get in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you get stuck on a puzzle, don\u2019t fret. Just look for the hidden moon pearl. Finding the moon pearl in a puzzle will allow you to open the next puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe further you progress the more special blocks you\u2019ll meet. Some are bolted down and are permanently stuck. Some blocks are asleep and can\u2019t move until they\u2019re woken up (set down a same-colored block next to it to wake it up). Entangled blocks are connected together by quantum forces\u2014when one moves so do the others. Blocks that are entangled share the same symbol.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEventually you\u2019ll meet even more devious blocks. Sticky blocks are gooey and will stick to other blocks. You can't pick them up directly; they can only be pushed and pulled around with other blocks and crates. Caterpillar blocks are linked to each other like a train; they can only be moved with the head or the tail. Hypno blocks don\u2019t need to be connected to solve a puzzle, but they\u2019ll cause a lot of pain. The hypno puts any colored block to sleep if you set one down right next to it. Finally, flip blocks have six sides. When you move them, they flip to a different side, exposing a new color.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOh, did you notice the strange glyphs on the ground? Each puzzle has three. Try to cover them all up with groups of linked blocks to master the puzzle. It\u2019ll be more tricky, but it\u2019s good for your brain.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat\u2019s about it. Have fun!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2013 Kieffer Bros.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:15:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16ff232bde11ed5341b3e8cee5d98a87.jpeg", "website": "http://blockwick2.kiefferbros.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 77, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Kieffer Bros."], "genres": ["Casual", "Educational", "Family", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kieffer Bros", "Kieffer Bros."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
