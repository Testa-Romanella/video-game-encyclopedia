Gross, the greatest criminal in the universe. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version, which contains both the Spectrum and Amstrad versions.<h3>Gameplay</h3>Pilot the N.O.M.A.D. through TALOS, Gross's heavily armoured homeworld, solving tricky puzzles, dodging deadly hazards, and shooting fiendish enemies. N.O.M.A.D. is controlled by rotating left and right, and providing either forward or backward thrust. This makes every level a challenging gauntlet, thankfully with regular checkpoints for progress.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including:<br/><br/><ul><li> Saving/loading the game at any point<br/></li><li> Support for most modern game controllers<br/></li><li> Full control remapping<br/></li><li> Image scaling and smoothing options</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T02:49:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b6/9b66ab366f850da4bea93b3c1dd4b37d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ocean Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Pixel Games UK"], "esrb_rating": null}
