It&#39;s a remake (or &quot;Wii-make,&quot; if you prefer) with gobs of added content. As with Under the Knife, the voice acting in Second Opinion is presented in the operation scenes to enhance the drama and punctuate the action.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2006-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-21T08:18:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f90/f90eb689b66675d9687db24d4a44c6c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.89, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 10, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": ["Atlus"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
