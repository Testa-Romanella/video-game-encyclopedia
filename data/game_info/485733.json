Pick up upgrades enemies drop to upgrade your stats and switch weapons. Grab amino acids to add to your chain, synergize their effects, and get hundreds of thousands in score.\u00a0Be fast, because it only gets harder as time goes on.</p>\n<p>Currently the game is still in development, I'm just putting it out now to get feedback and to see if people like the idea. Drop comments, suggestions, and anything I can improve on the game.
