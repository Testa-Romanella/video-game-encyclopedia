Control 3 different characters in a handful of levels to help a team of 3 navigate their way through a dungeon. Full of puzzles, traps, and platforming, the dungeon is no forgiving place for this team,\u00a0and it's imperative that they work together if they wish to exit successfully.</p>\n<p>The music used in this game is Jerry Five by Kevin MacLeod.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is a link to Kevin MacLeod's YouTube channel if you want to view his material:(398) Kevin MacLeod - YouTube</p>\n<p>This game was really fun to work on. The level design could've been better but I think it turned out ok in the later half of the game.\u00a0While I procrastinated a little bit during the 7 days, I am still proud of what I ended up creating. As a 17 year old aspiring game developer, I can say I have a lot to learn, but this project is the first stepping stone in the journey that awaits me. Although it may not be of better quality that what other participants made, I think I did alright for this being my first game I ever made!</p>\n<p>As a side note, I apologize if anything looks distorted or weird, I ran into aspect ratio issues and had to resize my tile maps sadly.</p>\n<p>I might work on the game further or I will move on to a new project, either way I ha da lot of fun making the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:08:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e9/5e9f07c1b540116281a5e4e49a237247.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Exodiaaa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
