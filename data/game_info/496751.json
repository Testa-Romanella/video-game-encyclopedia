Can you outrun the hunters, the other drivers, and the rising sun?<br/><br/>Vampire: The Masquerade \u2014 Night Road is a 650,000-word interactive horror novel by Kyle Marquis, based on Vampire: The Masquerade and set in the World of Darkness shared story universe. Your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based\u2014without graphics or sound effects\u2014and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. <br/><br/>It\u2019s a new Dark Age for the dead. When the Second Inquisition's vampire hunters hacked phone lines and computer networks to expose and destroy vampires all over the world, the elders turned to undead couriers like you. For ten years, you\u2019ve raced across the desert between cities, delivering vital information and supplies. But when an old friend reappears with a plan to disrupt the blood trade across the American Southwest, everything you\u2019ve built starts crashing down.<br/><br/>Outrun the Competition. Drive, hide, or fight back! Unleash the powers of your blood in ancient Disciplines to change form, vanish from sight, or dominate the minds of your enemies. Employ blood magic, inhuman strength, and the creatures of the night to escape destruction\u2014or just run your enemies off the road and keep driving.<br/><br/>Deliver or Die. All secrets have an expiration date\u2014and so do you. Race across the desert to deliver secrets, promises, and threats. Do whatever it takes to drop off your parcel.
