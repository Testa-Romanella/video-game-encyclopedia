Play as an unlikely trio on a quest to break the chilling enchantment and release the kind-hearted creatures of the north, so their warmth can thaw the snow and ice to reveal springtime.</p>\n\n<p>Made for Epic's Spring Jam 2020, this game is a fairly simple puzzle platformer. If people are interested, we will look into doing something like this game when we're finished with\u00a0Smugglers of Cygnus.</p>\n<p>In the event anyone actually pitches in money to this game, it will be split 3 ways between the devs and used for coffee. But there isn't enough game here to pay for :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:00:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21c/21c6954668285781e696ef7d833590e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Longplay Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
