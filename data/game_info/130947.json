The IRL Show was featured as an event for\u00a0Transmediale Vorspiele 2018.</p>\n<p>Made in Unity for the Vive, not sure if it works with oculus. There's no interaction, just look around and in the mirror while holding your controllers. There is no sound.</p>\n<p>This was my first time using Houdini Engine for Unity\u00a0to create background foliage. I used three different models of flowers and leaves\u00a0that I collaged together for the flowers in the background. I was trying to get a holographic effect with the shaders and ended up modifying the ones from this asset to get the effect I wanted. Everything else is pretty simple, and I used the vive mirror from this asset (sorry about the mirror bug).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/720/72002def7ac6fb83c7503e7d9ee59439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Violet Forest"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
