The game is a Gameboy game, with minor gbc colors added\u00a0(only on the title screen). You can play this on emulator, or on original hardware with a flash cart.\u00a0\u00a0The game does not have any audio at all, because I don't know how it works.</p>\n<p>The game might be updated later with fixes, extras, and other things.\u00a0I will post on my twitter for any updates @IAm24Bit.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks a lot!</p>\n<p>-IAm24Bit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T10:44:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcb/bcb85836aadc5775c1fdb1fee46c4c17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["24BitGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
