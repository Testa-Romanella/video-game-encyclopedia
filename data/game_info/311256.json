The Option button is kind of a private joke with our teachers :)</p>\n<p>This game was made in one week and is functionnal both with keyboard and a joystick to control the ship. Sadly you need a mouse to go trough the menu.</p>\n<p>Control is designed for french keyboard (Azerty) therefore I'm sorry to all the Qwerty user out there. If you have a joystick (like arcade fight stick) please plug it in and give it a try.<br/></p><p>Controls for keyboard are :</p>\n<p>ZQSD : Move Airship<br/>Spacebar : Shoot<br/>TAB : Nuke<br/>ESC : Pause<br/><br/>Thanks for reading and trying out this game, and asks any question you'd like :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:16:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d85/d85254ab2dc391c6667bdcc0c8663215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S0mango"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
