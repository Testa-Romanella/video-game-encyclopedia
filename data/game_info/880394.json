You can guess the object you transformed in by the visuals and movement mechanics.\u00a0The game has no goal, story or achievements, don't try to find it, it's pointless, you literally walk in circles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>move - WSAD</p>\n<p>look - mouse</p>\n<p>grab things - E</p>\n<p>Switch to things instantly - 1,2,3,4,5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Made for\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/queer-to-play\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>devs:</strong></p>\n<p>adam.fiser.dev@gmail.com</p>\n<p>shopingjs@gmail.com</p>\n<p>alzbeta.petruv@gmail.com</p>\n<p>kristyna.sumcova@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T10:05:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a335d26d57409eb10b4966c1cbb990d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VERY RARE"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
