Exhilarating music cheers you on in the background as\u00a0you play.\u00a0Can you survive?</p>\n<p>How to Play</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is a simple, but hard game. There are three bosses that you fight (three more if you count hard mode editions), scaling in difficulty as you go on. To beat a boss, you must dodge each of their attacks to get to the end alive. You may use the little circles to take a hit or use them to take the hit for you. It's really that simple.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Different Kind of Attacks</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The bosses in this game have an assortment of different attacks. These are them with descriptions of how they work.</p>\n<p>Single Bullet Shot - It is a singular square bullet that comes in your direction right away!</p>\n<p>Wavy Single\u00a0Bullet Shot - It is a single bullet like the single bullet shot attack, but this one slides left and right while going for you!</p>\n<p>Multi-Bullet Fire - This is similar to the single bullet shot attack, but this one fires multiple bullets at once.</p>\n<p>Homing Missile - This attack will follow your player for a short duration and then just continue straight. Be careful!</p>\n<p>Long Triangle Throw - This attack will come at you and spin! Unlike most of the other\u00a0attacks, this one\u00a0won't break on collision with you, so be careful!</p>\n<p>Triangle Spawner - This circle comes into the map and spawns little triangles that dash in your direction, but don't follow you like the missiles. The little triangles break on impact, but the spawner itself won't.</p>\n<p>How does it match the theme?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In this game, there are tiny little circles that you can collect, and they will follow you around. If you get hit, you die, but if you have some of these balls, you take place as one of them. Since you can survive longer with other circles, I think of this as being 'Stronger Together'.</p>\n<p>Credit</p>\n<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This game was made by ZachCreates.
