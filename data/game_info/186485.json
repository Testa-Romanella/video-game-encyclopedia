That means that you have to be quick on the keyboard!</p>\r\nThe gameplay\r\n<p>You control your character by telling him, how to block and how to hit your enemy. There are five regions in total, H(ead) L(eft),\u00a0H(ead) R(ight), B(ody) L(eft) , B(ody) R(ight), and the legs. Each of These regions can be combined with a \"hit\" or a \"block\" command (except from the legs). The legs are targeted with \"kick\", the defense is \"jump\". In addition, head hits can be avoided by \"duck\"ing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But there are not only plain commands you can use. You also unlock a variety of Cards that improve your damage, decrease you opponents defense or give you cool (and slightly stereotypical) extra boni.</p>\n<p>Combos and Combo Cards lead to a variety of ways to kill your Opponent- the only important Thing is that you can type and think at the same time: because that is what you will be generally lacking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a90/a9049ae41eb40bcf8603f08e553721b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MoreToLoose"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
