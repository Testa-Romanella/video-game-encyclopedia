You can create a new save file and load up in the world. You will be on the tutorial island with some basic movement and action hints. Your airship is on the left near the mines. To build up the airship press \"B\" to go into building mode and press \"TAB\"\u00a0to select building object by clicking categories on the bottom. For vertical movement make sure to build a balloon and stone engine bellow that. Feed coal to the engine when the doors are open and close them to start moving up. There are chests full of resources in one island of the demo. You play in creative mode so there is no need for resources. If you want to test the game without creative\u00a0mode open up console with \"F1\" and type god and enter. This toggles the god mode and you will need resources. Explore, build &amp; have fun. The game is in its very early stages so keep that in mind. You can send feedback in the pause menu when pressing \"ESC\" on the top right. Make sure to join the discord and talk in the room #airdrift-demo.</p><p>To learn more console (F1) commands type help and press enter.</p><p>Thank you, you are the best,</p><p>sypdev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T11:12:08", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sypdev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
