Its gonna be about trading, you will need to go from town to town and sell your items higher than you bought them. You will need to watch out for the random events that could happen, like robbing you, or the selller that had good prices got the plague and can't sell you things anymore etc.</p>\n\n<strong>IT'S ONLY A\u00a0DEMO<br/></strong>\n<p>Making<strong> </strong>oldschool renderer isn't easy. Everything that you can see on the screen is 2D and there is no 3D involved, so that its very similar to what it looked back in the days i will try to add more effects in future, like slowly refreshing screen, CRT-scanlines etc.<br/>The main screen is also a placeholder, im working on it right now ;)<br/>Remember, im not an artist so its not gonna be the best, but if someone can do art in VGA color palette and wants to help, reach me out gerwy@mailbox.org.</p>\n<p>Thank you ACB-prgm for Splash Screen</p>\n<p>And Big Thanks too dungeoncrawlers.org and their Atlas generator, it won't be possible without it &lt;3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T06:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/048/048667f265822f2396b7b2652ccd80ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["g3rwy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
