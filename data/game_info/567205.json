However, there is some trouble after his vehicle has trouble. It is up to the Fallout Runner to get the resources needed to go back home.</p>\n<p>Details about <em><strong>The Fallout Runner</strong></em></p>\n<p>The world is not what it was before. Using Pixel art to show the environment, there is an untold story about the land that once was the United States. There is a lot to show and understand from the environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A hidden story revealed. Even though the environment tells a story of its own, there is more about what has happened. A series of events that lead to this outcome. However, it is up to the player to put the pieces together and find out what truly happened. Some interactive elements will let inform you about what is happening and what has happened. There is a story to uncover, you just need to search for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Exploration of a land once lived in. There are areas to explore in these lands. Some more larger than others. Here the player can get to explore the land where no one lives anymore.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alert and Responsive. There is no need for overly complicated HUDs. In this experience, there are always\u00a0 responses when interacting. There is no penalty for trying to interact with objects. Instead, the player is always informed with that is happening. From forgetting where to go to retrieving certain objects, there is always a response for the player.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This experience is designed to make the world a character of its own while also having its own story. There is a story behind all the chaos and destruction, but it is more about what can be inferred than what is actually told. Not all statements are necessarily true and not all lies are false.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is also my first time using Bitsy so I wanted to learn more about how to make a game with limited resources and restrictions from the Engine itself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Features Explained (Spoilers) :\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here the shuffle variable was played with to always give a random text when the player uses a specific item in the beginning of the experience. This will help the player with the story if they would like to learn more about it. The \"INFO\" computers use this in order to give information and story clues to the player without making a giant dialog opening in the beginning. Each time the player uses that computer, a new piece of information is displayed. This avoid having all the information given all at once and makes the player get new information for using that computer.</p>\n<p>Another feature is the variable for items. There is a section where the player may get confused as to where to place a certain item, which is the fuel. The players may think that they need to take it to the front seat. So in to help the player know where the place it, variables were used to make that interactive sprite say something different in the case they do have the item they need to finish the game. So if the player has the fuel in their inventory and goes to the seat sprite, they are told that they might need to go somewhere else to use that item.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Credits</strong></em></p>\n<p>Design, Art, and Story by\u00a0Danny Lopez\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made with Bitsy<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:36:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b45/b455de87f30941f243cc6869b12468a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Invalid_Name_404"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
