At least, until they all disappeared, working with a mysterious organization known as H\u01ceid\u00e0o (\"HighDow\" \u6d77\u76d7), you are tasked with exploring Insula and discovering what really happened to all the poor souls that had called this home.  To survive that, you will need some serious tech and no small amount of credits.<br/><br/>You know of one way to get that out here.  The Bounty Royale, a brutal, mechanized bounty-hunting bloodsport that runs autonomously right here down on the surface of Genesis.  To get started, you'll need to recover and repair one of the light and agile combat exo-suits that were used early on by the security forces on Insula.  If you survive, you can use your winnings to start amassing the tech you will need to build your own anthrobot, a fully mechanized combat-ready battle chassis that you control from afar via neural link.<br/><br/>One way or another, your only hope of making it home, relies on solving the mystery of a now-dead Insula.  All paths to that end, begin in the arena.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Battle Royale Reimagined</strong><br/>In Insula: Bounty Royale, you play as an Anthrotech, ex-military combat engineers specially trained in building and maintaining the Drakonis Anthro combat machines known as Anthrobots.  Recently awoken from stasis and apparently stranded on what used to be a thriving mining colony in the atmosphere above Genesis, you must survive long enough to find out what happened and find a way home.<br/><br/>Insula: Bounty Royale, is the first-ever arena shooter built atop some of the more popular battle royale mechanics, to fully intertwine a compelling and adrenaline-filled story with the competitive PvP arena gameplay. Your base is where the story plays out, segments of solo gameplay will occur to advance your story. Events in the multiplayer arena will feed directly into that story and your character\u2019s progression through it. While the solo story aspects are optional, there is much to be gained by participating in that aspect of the game.<br/><br/><br/><strong>The Arena</strong><br/>In the arena Insula further distinguishes itself.  You can compete in person, donning a fully combat ready exosuit, or from afar using one of the neural link controlled Anthrobots.  The arenas are highly vertical and utilizing fast paced acrobatic flight capabilities, your tactical options are virtually limitless as literally every inch of play space is traversable and usable to your advantage.  <br/><br/><br/><strong>Bounty Royale</strong><br/>The Bounty Royale is a unique twist on the battle royale game mode. When a new match starts, each contestant has a bounty on their head. Outfitting yourself with advanced technology, you must track and hunt down your opponents and eliminate them to collect their bounties. With each opponent you eliminate, your own bounty will increase, making you a more desirable target for everyone else. The other hunters are not your only concern, however, nor are they your only source of earning. There be beasties about in this place, and they be hungry! Lucrum pays a hefty bounty for the extermination of these dangerous creatures as well! <br/><br/>Be warned though, the commotion caused by the competition often draws attention from larger hordes of creatures nearby. It is not unheard of for the contestants to temporarily work together to survive long enough to finish hunting each other.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Custom-Built Your Way</strong><br/>Customize your anthrobots &amp; exosuits with a vast array of armor. Build them big and beefy or light and nimble; it's your style! And of course, no brand is complete without custom paint jobs, logos, and programmed battle taunts!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Drones And Abilities</strong><br/>Once you've built your dream battle rig, finish it off by adding the perfect companion drone. They\u2019ll provide data recording, scan analysis, and resource extraction. They also offer specific skills to use during combat. Armor repair, energy shields, advanced tracking, recon, and even stealth, pick one that's right for you!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Melee - Not A Last Resort</strong><br/>Customization and play style are essential; you can customize your combat just as you customize your armor and drones. Lay waste to your opposition with lightning-fast strikes from small dual wielded energy blades, wreak havoc with the wide arcing swings of deadly polearms, or pound them into scrap with devastating blows from massive rocket hammers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Player Bounties</strong><br/>You're not just fighting for bragging rights. Bounties are the heart and soul of Insula: Bounty Royale. Each opponent has a bounty on their head. Putting them in the ground means creds in your pocket and creds in your pocket means upgrades! Upgrade your base, kit out your bot, &amp; enhance your lifestyle! Be mindful of your notoriety, though. The more you take, the more you're worth, and the more others will want to add you to their trophy list!<br/><br/><br/><strong>High-Octane Aerial Combat</strong><br/>You are not limited to just where you can reach on foot, each exosuit and Anthrobot is outfitted with a customizable flight rig.
