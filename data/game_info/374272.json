Or perhaps you've never skated before and don't know how, either way you can have fun messing around on the pond. If you fall the ice isn't real so it will only hurt as much as whatever your floor is made of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway I made this because I love hockey and VR and wanted to be able to skate around and shoot pucks in VR. I would like to develop this further into a full game but have no idea if anyone would be interested in that so I thought I would release what I have done for free and gauge peoples interest and hopefully gather some feedback. I was having fun just messing around\u00a0\u00a0so I hope some other people will as well.
