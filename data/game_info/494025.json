(demo)<br/></p>\n<p>My name is Apple. I created LiLy's Revenge back in 2008.\u00a0 LiLy was just some doodle back then about a depressed devil girl, then it turned into an illustrated series. A devil girl avenges herself by torturing those\u00a0who hurt her.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy\u00a0chapter 0. and stay\u00a0interested enough to play more chapters in the\u00a0future.<br/></p>\n<p>PS: Find all 4 achievements to get free stuff from LiLy.
