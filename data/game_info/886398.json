Each verse will appear on the screen while it is being sung, type it before the next one begins to be sung. The more you type, the more points you will get.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T04:30:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b04/b04b148e555ef19f6d084ca880c20b08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ronia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
