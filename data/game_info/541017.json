{"id": 541017, "slug": "the-epic-of-gilgamesh", "name": "The Epic of Gilgamesh", "name_original": "The Epic of Gilgamesh", "description": "<p>This is a game connecting the worlds of Norse and Sumerian Mythology with some creative liberties taken. Heavily inspired by the Fate series and the game Hades. You play as Gilgamesh, King of Uruk, tricked by the trickster god Loki you get sent to the Nordic realms where you have to fight your way to the Norse gods to find a way home and obtain the secret to eternal life. This is a roguelike, hack and slash, single player game with fast paced action.</p>\n<p>This was made using the Unreal Engine and is not complete, for now its just a concept piece made for the DevSquad Academy Games Jam. Although, we may continue with it after the jam has ended.<br/></p>\n<p>Created By:<br/></p>\n<p>Samuel Elliot - Programmer<br/>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Samuel_Elliot_J<br/>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0XNsXwJIhbkx66_dQ3-hfg?view_as=subscriber<br/></p>\n<p>Max Thomas - Music /Sound Engineer</p>\n<p>Dylan Parker - 3D Modeller / Artist<br/>Art Station:\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/platinumparker/profile<br/></p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>- We had made 3D models for the main character (Gilgamesh) and enemies (Frost Giants). However we ran out of time to put them in, so we are going to be submitting with the Mixamo stand in models we used.<br/>- We also had an art piece for the background of the dialogue section, however our programmers computer stopped working towards the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading. I know that we haven't really addressed the theme apart from saying that it mixes the world of Sumerian and Norse mythology, however we still hope you enjoy the game. Please leave any constructive criticism in the comment, we will try to reply to any comments as soon as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T07:06:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b2/9b2ae435ea48dc368800a35f02757c46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GilgameshGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
