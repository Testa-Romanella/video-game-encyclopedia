The novel explores how the stories that our cultures teach us form our worldview, and how we must question the motives of the storyteller if we ever want to learn the truth. In this section, you must decide whether you can trust Thero, a bloodthirsty forest goddess, and weigh the consequences of freeing her.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping to write some more complex games soon, with new stories\u00a0specifically designed for a non-linear, interactive format. Please check back in the next few weeks for more!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T10:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b3/4b36c62b4b4bf8f2775c3c6d564966f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChloeFBray"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
