Using keys, portals and several other features to find a way to the finish.<br/> Use the arrow keys to move.<br/> An old game I made a few years back.

But it was a learning experience for me and I'm glad people get to play it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/626/6269510518f4896fadf34a3dc4c1c04c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ruff_Stuff_Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
