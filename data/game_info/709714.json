I know I do. <em>Mario Kart Wii</em> was an identity-defining game for me, even though I was only eight years old when it was released. The game influenced my hobbies, creative projects, friendships, and family time alike. Many of my most positive memories from childhood involve some version of <em>Mario Kart</em> in some capacity, and <em>Mario Kart Wii</em> was the catalyst for all of them.</p>\n<p>Now, in my 20s, I'm revisiting <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>  in a way that I've always dreamed of doing. Not only am I rebuilding all of the tracks, mechanics, and game modes in a different engine --- I'm also adding several new components to this glorious amalgam of content. I pulled the first set of assets for this game into a Unity project on June 15th, 2021, and sixth months later, an alpha version that showcases snippets of every feature  is finally ready. Suffice it to say that this project means a lot to me, and I'm so excited to be able to share it with everyone!</p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER #1:</strong> Much of the source material, of course, is from the original <em>Mario Kart Wii </em>game created by Nintendo in 2008.
