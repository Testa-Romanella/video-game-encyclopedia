Bye.\r\n</p>\n<p>Nah, more seriously, it's a project I've been working on since February 2022. It's a parkour game that lives up to its name for its difficulty. There are 10 levels with varying mechanics and varying difficulty. This game can be considered a final version, even if it is not. This is a beta on stand-by for several months. But who do I see? A French hidden in the trees. Come, don't be afraid. This game is basically in French, with an English version. English version which is only converted on the interface. The 3D texts in the levels are always in French. But Google Translate is allowed dear English.</p>\n<p>Besides, this game is on itch.io, but you can also visit the Insane Parkour website: insane-parkour0.webnode.fr (with English translations). This game is accessible to English! Come Markiplier, Pewdiepie, and the other famous English youtubers. Well, it all depends if you like die-and-retry and parkour games (with horror).</p>\n<p>A small (I would even say BIG) very nice parkour game that deserves to be tested.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:37:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/849/84973c31092436ee8ac50c0edf0c32e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ananel81"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
