I'm brainfoam, and I made this game for this year's April Ludum Dare. This game was made pretty quickly, but is packed with some cute features that I worked pretty hard on. This is more of a visualizer/tamagotchi-type game, so it's at most a short and sweet experience. This may recieve some updates in the future, but for the most part, this was just for a small jam. I had a bunch of fun making this, and I hope you have fun playing it~</p><p>Twitter: @brainfoam_</p><p>Instagram: @brainfoam_</p><p> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/dea99d51f17b5423afa30e7af3499784.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["brainfoam"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
