{"id": 970030, "slug": "square-fast", "name": "Square Fast", "name_original": "Square Fast", "description": "Square Fast is a fast-paced hardcore rhythm arcade, where you have to defeat different enemies using only 2 buttons.<br/><br/>I wanted to make a game with almost no in-game progression, the only progress that player should experience is the skill improvement (ofcourse there are few levels that you will have to unlock too). Don't you love the feeling when something seems impossible at first, but after you practice it not only start to seem possible, but later even seems relatively easy?<br/>Square Fast focuses on pushing players ability to react quickly, on later levels you will have almost no time to think, only time to do. Which leaves you no other option but to enter the state of flow, where your brain tells you what to do and you do it, only listen to your reflexes and see how much your skill grew. No time to think.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>7 levels</strong>, from hard to extremely hard<br/></li><li><strong>5 chiptune bangers</strong> by Balloonbear<br/></li><li><strong>Deep gameplay</strong> with simplest controls</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T23:43:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bd/9bdd08e7c848c98c66099385a6ee226c.jpg", "website": "http://squarefast.info/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Maksim Chugunov"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Maksim Chugunov"], "esrb_rating": null}
