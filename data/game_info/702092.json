It helps the player keeping track of their points and AP (Action Points). There was originally already an app for this but it became outdated. This app is made for more recent devices. (android 10 or higher)\u00a0Touch the logo to get the instructions or to reset the game.</p>\n<p>Only for android for now, but i can eventually make a desktop app of it if requested. (but who uses a computer to run\u00a0a card game tool? :p ) This app is completely free and no ads are included. But it requires a deck of\u00a0the\u00a0My Little Pony CCG to enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T09:37:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f6/3f63549572954744e593e505769b7f59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Max le Fou"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
