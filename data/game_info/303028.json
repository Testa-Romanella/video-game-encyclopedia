{"id": 303028, "slug": "escape-amnesia-manor", "name": "Escape Amnesia Manor", "name_original": "Escape Amnesia Manor", "description": "<p>Escape Amnesia Manor is a dark, thrilling, and thought provoking 2D escape the room game. Unlike most other escape the room games, the game does not take place in the first-person view, and the player does not have to switch between several forced perspectives (like Myst). Instead, the point of view will feel similar to Pok\u00e9mon and Stardew Valley at a \u00be perspective. The player can move freely about and interact with the environments. As with most escape the room games, the player will follow a breadcrumb trail of clues that leads to the discovery of riddles, keys, codes, and eventually, the unlocking of the final door to freedom. As a result, the game will be absolutely linear in storyline, while still allowing the player to explore the room. Escape Amnesia Manor will have a strong emphasis on writing and puzzle design, forcing you to think outside the room. The only living person that you can interact with is yourself, \u201cliving\u201d being the operative term. Will you make it out and reach the goal? </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T02:31:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a1573ad220e1f814729dba688c0a413.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Follie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
