Because of my poor eyesight since childhood, I have been wearing glasses since I was very young, and I have always been afraid of insomnia. So now, when I already have some skills in making games, I am thinking about whether I can develop a game for the blind, a game that can have an interactive and playable feel only through sound.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 I was clueless at first, I have a friend who now works in an advertising agency when I told her I was going to make a game for the blind. She sent me a Volkswagen ad from a few years ago and said this video might help me. In this ad, Volkswagen hired a blind photographer to film their new car. The photographer said that he judged the texture of objects by touching and tapping. This inspired me, different sounds represent different textures, then these different sounds can also become elements and variables of the game. So I immediately thought of going to the park in summer to catch bugs when I was a kid. Different bugs make different sounds. That's where my inspiration came from.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T18:03:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/916/91601401fbd877d3c10269f58c502344.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Franklin Wu"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
