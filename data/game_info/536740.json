Unfortunately, the cat must pay a price for each piece collected. For each piece they carry, their movement gets sluggish and their speed gets slower. This wouldn't be a problem if no one was chasing them, however, let's say a lot of the spooky creatures in this spooky forest aren't very\u00a0happy with the cat's actions.
