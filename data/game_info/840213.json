{"id": 840213, "slug": "pixel-dreams", "name": "Pixel Dreams", "name_original": "Pixel Dreams", "description": "<p>Pixel Dreams is a 2D\u00a0platformer game that puts users through five challenging college class themed levels. Each of these levels has their own unique obstacles and enemies, with the ultimate goal of preventing you from scoring enough points to pass the class. Can you beat all five levels? Will you be able to find the hidden secrets and mobs? Or will your imagination get the best of you... That and more awaits for you in our 2D platformer: Pixel Dreams.</p><p>Use either the W-A-S-D keys or the arrow keys\u00a0to move. Double jumps are allowed! Use the spacebar to defeat enemies to score enough points.</p>\n<p>This game was made as part of a 16-week project development season with a team of eight student developers! We went from having no experience in Godot or any game development to a platformer! Even after the 16-weeks, 12 more weeks passed as we tried to juggle summer courses and work whilst working on the project with even fewer developers. It's been a long journey, but we've finally made it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T13:05:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0b6d9c3f571cdc356d840590a91fb10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BrianStormYT"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
