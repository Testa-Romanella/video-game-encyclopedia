He found common cause with Asterion, until he didn't anymore. A tale of diaspora, gender, and survival.<br/></p>\n<p>\"Theseus\" is a surrealist narrative game about helping a messy Athenian prince break up with his Minotaur love of five years. Navigate a physical labyrinth of all his internalized self-doubt in this narrative adventure! Playtime is around the length of a movie, and is meant to be consumed in a single sitting.<br/><br/><strong>CW:</strong> Mentions of partner violence <br/><strong>Troubleshooting: </strong>The game works, it just takes a couple of minutes to load past the start screen. I highly recommend tabbing out to do something else while you wait.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:59:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92ba21341803de585041fa6f9d29deac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sisi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
