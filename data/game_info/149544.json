Because firstly, it is the ultimate throwback in time for me personally because I basically grew up with the classic Zelda games, like A Link to the Past, Link's Awakening and Ocarina of Time.</p>\n<p>And secondly, because of Link waving his sword to <em>throw back</em> energy balls that several end bosses are summoning.</p>\r\n\r\nLink getting ready to throw back a deadly energy ball\r\n\r\n<p>The end result is this endless runner with Sam (also my initials), the Samurai. Jump, wave your sword, double jump, and wave your sword again. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>This game is open source and you can find the code\u00a0on GitHub.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/4344333df582cba42272cd5ec6731f99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["smax"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
