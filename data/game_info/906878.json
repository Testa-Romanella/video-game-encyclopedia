I am 11 years old and an elementary school student. I learned programming by myself. In 2017, I first studied Unity3D. While making various games, I wanted to make a game that could compete with others, and after developing it for a year, I felt uncomfortable about the shortcomings of Unity3D, and I quit developing games and learned the Minecraft Bukkit API. In early 2022, I heard about Godot Engine through my father. I initially thought Godot Engine would be no different from Unity3D, but I was wrong. I fell in love with the first Godot Engine I learned, and I continued to study Godot Engine. In 2022, I had a dream while I was sleeping, and I thought it would be okay to use it as a subject for games. So I started developing it right away, and the game has been developed.<br/><br/>Thank you for listening to my story so far!</p>\n\n<p>\uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694! \uc800\ub294 11\uc0b4 \ucd08\ub4f1\ud559\uc0dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ub294 \ub3c5\ud559\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc744 \ubc30\uc6e0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 2017\ub144, \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0\ub294 Unity3D\ub97c \uacf5\ubd80\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\ub2e4\uac00 \uc5b4\ub290\uc0c8 \uc800\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5c8\uace0, 1\ub144\uac04 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub2e4\uac00 \uc800\ub294 Unity3D\uc758 \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \ubd88\ud3b8\ud558\uac8c \ub290\uaef4\uc84c\uace0, \uc800\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uadf8\ub9cc\ub450\uace0 Minecraft Bukkit API\ub97c \ubc30\uc6e0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 2022\ub144 \ucd08, \uc800\ub294 \uc800\uc758 \uc544\ubc84\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Godot Engine\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub4e4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ub294 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0\ub294 Godot Engine\ub3c4 Unity3D\uc640 \ub2e4\ub974\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc800\uc758 \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \ud2c0\ub838\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ub294 \ucc98\uc74c \ubc30\uc6b4 Godot Engine\uc758 \ub9e4\ub825\uc5d0 \ud479 \ube60\uc838 \ubc84\ub838\uace0, \uc800\ub294 Godot Engine\uc744 \uacc4\uc18d\ud574\uc11c \uacf5\ubd80\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 2022\ub144, \uc800\ub294 \uc7a0\uc744 \uc790\ub358 \uc911\uc5d0 \uafc8\uc744 \uafb8\uc5c8\uace0 \uc800\ub294 \uadf8 \uafc8\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc18c\uc7ac\ub85c \uc4f0\uba74 \uad1c\ucc2e\uc744 \uac83 \uac19\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0dd\uac01\uc774 \ub4e4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \uc800\ub294 \uace7\ubc14\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ucc29\uc218\ud588\uace0, \uadf8 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc774\uc5b4\uc838 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uac83 \uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.</p>\n<p>\uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc800\uc758 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4\uc8fc\uc154\uc11c \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sponsor me and encourage game development!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\uc800\ub97c \ud6c4\uc6d0\ud558\uc154\uc11c \uac8c\uc784 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ud798\uc744 \ubd80\ucd94\uaca8 \uc8fc\uc138\uc694!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T12:33:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e7bdf2b27716b704d7723e8552f1589.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["octglam"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
