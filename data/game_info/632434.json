{"id": 632434, "slug": "black-hole-era", "name": "Black Hole Era", "name_original": "Black Hole Era", "description": "<p>One by one the last stars are winking out and the true Black Hole Era approaches. A period of nearly endless stability around which your ancient civilization will quietly await the inevitable decay of protons, and the final oncoming darkness after quintillions of years. This almost eternal period of stability is interrupted by the formation of Star Scars, an unknown phenomena that rips apart some of the few remaining degenerate stellar remnants. From these scars pours forth an alien form of life determined to reignite the black holes, causing the death of untold digital beings, and the collapse of a civilization trillions of years of age.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tIn this game you will portray one of the mighty vessels called into being to defend your home. Sentient and self aware, you are equipped with space bending engines, exotic energy weapons, and nanoscale fabricators for self repair. However, resources are scarce and must be scavenged from your foes or rationed carefully from the homeworld vaults. You will have to weigh the benefits of bringing home materials or using them in the field.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Your missions will take you from diving into the scars left on the last few stars from these invaders, all the way to plumbing the depths of discarded dyson spheres from an epoch before this one. The last remaining stars must be extinguished and the alien invaders forced back from the edges of the event horizon you call home.\u00a0 Will you commit yourself to an endless siege, will you dive into the scarred stars themselves to strike back at the invaders? Or will you betray your entire civilization and allow the aliens to reignite the stellar furnaces, rolling back the clock and resetting the universe to an earlier more vigorous age?\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is Illuminated by LUMEN, based on the LUMEN RPG system designed by Spencer Campbell, Gila RPGs.
