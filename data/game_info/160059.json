No performance optimizations were done on this game</li><li>This is a pretty rough game. We were on a super tight deadline and didn't have much time for polish and level balance</li><li>You can only wave at people waving at you</li><li>You must hold the mouse button down to wave. The wave takes a moment to complete.</li><li>If you start waving at a stranger and you let go, you don't lose as much time than if you complete the wave to a stranger.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Priyal Seebadri"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
