Also my first attempt in a long time to make something playable. Made with UPBGE.<br/>Honestly there is so much more I want to add to this and there are quite many things to polish. To count a few:<br/>- Longer level<br/>- Textures<br/>- Sounds<br/>- A bit improved controls<br/><strong>- More levels that are unlockable and each are a different little mini game that somehow relates to the game jam theme and the title of the game, making somewhat of a narrative together.</strong><br/>At the moment, I think it does follow the theme of the game jam quite well as erythrocytes are definitely a part of what makes us alive - a particle of life. I'm happy that for now at least I have something with beginning, a bit of gameplay and end. Also the level generate randomly from given parts. And I know there is a little glitch with health bar for now.<br/><strong>- DevLog of this is in the process and will be posted a later today or tomorrow on YT.</strong><br/>Controls:<br/>A - Move to right side<br/>D - Move to left side<br/>Esc - Exit game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T20:34:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0d/c0d2dc98c2b1071c9d4afae9701309d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skeindem"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
