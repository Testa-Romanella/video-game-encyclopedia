Your freedom and your communities lively-hood relies on you. Survive the worn-torn wasteland left from the final war.<h3>How to survive</h3><br/>To scavenge for loot you must rummage through the trash piles left from the past lives of those before and the desolate structures that were left behind. This is the only way you will find enough food and water for your people with such a low supply of air filters that are needed to breathe on the surface. To find more filters you must look for supply drops, merchants, or bodies of past scavengers.<h3>Life found within the fog</h3><br/>You are not alone in this wasteland, throughout the fog you will find factions of survivors and merchants who will trade armaments and equipment for goods they are in need of. These weapons and equipment will help you against the vast amount of new 'life' found, this includes the loud rattling bass of the void and the floating lifeless bodies of the spirit walkers who will do everything in their power to stop you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T04:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/156/156cdddd6c9ec0db0cd7227868a02656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LethalLizard Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LethalLizard Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
