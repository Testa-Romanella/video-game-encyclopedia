Repeat the gesture to disable it again.</p><p>\r\nOnce the grid is on, placing both hands in the far third of the grid will move you forward, the near third will move you back, the higher third will move you up etc. </p>\n<p>\r\nTo rotate, place one hand in the near third and the other in the far third of the grid. \r\nTo roll, place one hand in the lower third and the other in the higher third of the grid.\r\nTo stop, place both hands in the center cell. This will quickly reduce all velocity. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nFor visual examples of the movement controls, watch the in-game instructional video or the gameplay trailer.</p>\n<p><em>Repairing modules:</em><br/>\r\nOnce you reach a broken module, disable the motion grid then use your hands to push buttons, slide sliders or grab objects. </p>\n<strong>Gameplay:</strong>\n<p>The goal of the game is to survive until you are replaced by other interns. \r\nThe astronaut can see the remaining time on his helm display. \r\nTo survive, you need to keep all three station resources from dropping to zero. </p>\n<p>The Astronaut navigates around the space station and can repair modules based on the Operator's instructions.</p>\n<p>The Operator has an overview of where the modules are, which are broken and the state of the main \r\nstation resources. He holds the solutions to all modules, and is able to overload certain\r\nresources to get a temporary boost but break a module in the process.</p>\n<strong>Types of modules:</strong>\n<p><em>Hex Module:</em><br/>\r\nThe Astronaut tells the Operator the serial number of the module, and the values \r\non the buttons. Once the Operator enters these values, they can see the connections \r\nthe Astronaut should make by pressing on two buttons in sequence. Pressing a wrong sequence will reduce the resource.</p>\n<p><em>Fuse Module:</em><br/>\r\nThe Astronaut tells the Operator the serial number and the colors of the fuse and \r\neach fuse slot. Once the Operator sets these colors, an arrow will appear above the \r\nslot where the fuse should be put. Putting it in the wrong slot will reduce the resource.</p>\n<p><em>Sliders:</em><br/>\r\nThe Astronaut tells the Operator the serial number and starting positions of the sliders. \r\nOnce the Operator enters them, they get back multipliers for each slider and a final needed sum. \r\nThe Astronaut needs to set the sliders to certain values so that, when multiplied with the multipliers, \r\nthey add up to the needed sum. If the \u201cSend\u201d button is pressed and the sum is wrong, the resource is reduced. </p>\n<strong>Created by:</strong>\n<p>Kristijan Trajkovski<br/>\r\nMarko Zarev<br/>\r\nFilip Chausidis<br/>\r\nSimon Stojanovski<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic used:<br/>\r\nPodington Bear - Floating In Space", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a0d0a63f120efa999cf6958c711c533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FREEZX"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
