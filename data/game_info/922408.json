The theme was separation so I\u00a0decided to base separation on a number of things.\u00a0 Separate food items, separate animals, separate planets..etc .</p>\n<p>The objective is to click or drag items to the correct bin when their name is called, earning points for each correct action and effectively sorting (separating) them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game can be played using only the mouse (though I am working on the mobile counterpart still.) The game also has a leaderboard where players can enter their name to compete with others. Before you get to\u00a0the leader board though, you will receive a Star rating based on your overall performance (score) across the separate stages. One is the highest ranking star and it is golden-yellow.</p>\n<p>I am still working on some things but I know the game Jam ends soon and so I have submitted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T06:44:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a111b7b4a76f92a9e5e98287c6ddd058.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JJAngelus"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
