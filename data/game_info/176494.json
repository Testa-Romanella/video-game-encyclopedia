A corrupted governing faction, the \"Square Heads\" has taken over the world and has segregated the population by the shape of their heads. You play a \"Circle Head\" whose shape has been completely cast out from society. You must infiltrate each of the 4 zones and reunite the population of the world. To achieve this you must replace negative propaganda, highjack radio towers, and convince members of each zone to side with your cause. All whilst avoiding the \"Square\" headed enforcers. Eventually, once you have gained enough of a following you will be able to debate with the mayor (by approaching him) of each town in order to convince him to allow the previous zones inhabitants access to the current zone. Help unify the world of the Shapeizens!</p><p><strong>Co</strong><strong>ntrols:</strong></p><p>WASD <strong>-</strong> Move the character</p><p>Mouse <strong>- </strong>Camera controls</p><p>Scroll wheel <strong>-</strong> Camera Height</p><p>E <strong>-</strong> Interact </p><p>CTRL <strong>- </strong>Sneak</p>Arrow Keys <strong>- </strong>Mayor debate minigame<p><strong>Extra stuff: </strong></p><p>Trouble in Shape Town is a prototype game made for #ResistJam, and is a little rough around the edges, devleoped by Almost Lunch Games:</p><p><strong>Sam Mullins</strong> - @Pixelated_Sushi</p><p><strong>Kieran Hamill </strong>- @KieranHamill</p><p><strong>James Quinton</strong> - @JamesGameDev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a3c6450d0e4a9af2c8ac4501ea83498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlmostLunch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
