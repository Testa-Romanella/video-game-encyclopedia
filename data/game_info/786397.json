If success iterate with next room</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>There are three experiments to complete, select one to play using the function keys (F1,\u00a0F3, F5) or the action buttons on TheVic20's 'TheJoystick'. Can press these keys / buttons at any time to switch experiments without losing your progress.</p>\n<p>The experiment main rooms reveal doorways to the trial rooms. Initially in each experiment you will see just the first trial room. Complete it to reveal more,</p>\n<p>Control Echo the Mouse\u00a0with a joystick and learn his abilities as you go. Hint, it is best to start with Experiment 1.</p>\n<p>To beat a\u00a0trial room collect a piece of cheese before the time runs out. You only have 5 seconds to do this between each cheese and more of the room is revealed. Sometimes there will be more than one cheese and your choice can drastically affect the room.</p>\n<p>You have infinite clones but must be successful to proceed. If a trial room in one experiment is proving to be too challenging, jump over to one of the other experiments instead.</p>\n<p>Complete the trials in all three experiments to win Echo's freedom.</p>\n<ul><li>Learn each room</li><li>Don't hesitate</li><li>Be precise</li><li>Experiment!</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Game design, code and graphics - Andy Hewitt</li><li>Devilish level designs - Ross Hewitt</li></ul>\n<p>Created using Turbo Rascal.
