The earth has since been devastated by an outside invader. One of the last humans alive has come to your prison and broken the seal. You must free the world from the outsiders -- for it is *your* world after all! Deadwood is a 2D side-scroller/platformer. Enemies are around you. Your powers aren't offensive or direct, your ability is to channel your life and death magic to raise plants and dead things to act for you. Control with direction keys. Space to jump. Hold E to channel your power near gravestones or trees to have them fight your foes.</p>\n\n<p>Created for the Global Game Jam 2023 at AIE with Seattle Indies.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T05:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afd/afda3bbf86cf085588f520c6dcc152e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jtjutajoh", "Victor Erickson"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
