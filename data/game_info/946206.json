They were a hexblade warlock of a royal family that was quickly destroying themselves and their kingdom. This kingdom was heavily inspired by English noble squabbles along with the cycle of decay and rebirth of kingdoms and empires from Chinese history. I am uploading this because while unfinished as that campaign ended, I am still really proud of what I put into this character.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T14:46:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed6aaa423f93be1b1ab4ac55de3d7862.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mecasloth"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
