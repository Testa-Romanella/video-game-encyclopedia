Experience all-new stages designed to challenge, delight and unwind the mind.<br/><br/>Super Chains is the sequel and long awaited follow-up to the classic puzzler Chains from 2008. An entire decade has passed, yet the object of the game remains deceptively simple: Connect three or more spheres of the same color into chains... but beware! The rules and difficulty ramp up quickly, so thinking outside of the box is necessary in order to advance. Those who just want to relax, can retreat to one of the zen-inducing puzzles that focus on matching or flow. Everyone is bound to have a good time in Super Chains!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c16/c16eb08f4c7ad3f4741aff663d2df488.jpg", "website": "http://2dengine.com/chains/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["2DEngine"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2DEngine"], "esrb_rating": null}
