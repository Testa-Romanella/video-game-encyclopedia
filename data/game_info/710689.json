Trapped inside of these paintings, find a way out by traversing through colored pillars - <em>change your paint color to match that of the pillar and you will pass through.</em></p>\n<p>Collect wings in each level to increase your score. Paint palettes will increase your paint meter, while paint rollers will give you a speed boost without using any of your paint!</p>\n<p>\"Accompanied\" by <strong>Lilith</strong>, a celestial being who doesn't appreciate your mindlessness. Pursue on through 8 different paintings, what is beyond the paintings? Is there a greater being, a greater good? A greater evil? What does it matter, anyways, to a <strong>Dummy </strong>like yourself?<br/><br/>Between level sequences, engage in conversation with <strong>Lilith </strong>as she slowly slips into insanity. After all, talking to you is like talking with a brick wall.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Progress saves automatically after each level sequence and is automatically loaded upon opening the game.<br/></em><br/>_____________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Design, Programming, Art</strong> - Luke Klegraefe</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p>\n<p>\n<em>Wistful Rain \u2013 Ghostrifter Official\r\n<br/>\r\nFar Behind \u2013 Silent Partner\r\n<br/>\r\nPrelude No. 2 \u2013 Chris Zabriskie\r\n<br/>\r\nE Minor Prelude \u2013 Chopin\r\n<br/>\r\nGymnopedie No. 3 \u2013 Wahneta Meixsell\r\n<br/>\r\nSnowing \u2013 Peter Rudenko\r\n<br/>\r\nC Major Prelude \u2013 Bach\r\n<br/>\r\nPrelude No 11 \u2013 Chris Zabriskie\r\n<br/>\r\nAllemande \u2013 Wahneta Meixsell\r\n<br/>\r\nGymnopedie No 1 \u2013 Satie</em></p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:36:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f80e59fefaa4e00ad02399a2a1cfbf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luke Klegraefe"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
