The wonderland of their youth has become nothing more than a far-off dream, until one night, Bucks and her newborn daughter disappear without a trace. Soon, Iggy and his friends find themselves being pulled back into that world of childish glee\u2014only their wishes and desires aren\u2019t so innocent anymore, and the world has twisted itself into a land of corruption, evil, and lust that\u2019s scarcely recognizable.</p>\n<strong>Our Wonderland</strong> is a horror-fantasy visual novel focusing on the relationships between five childhood friends. It contains five different arcs, each with its own ending, and your choices affect the order of the arcs, the amount of peril the protagonists experience (hint: how many times you violently die), and the final post-arc epilogue.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the <strong>first arc of the game</strong> is available to play. The first arc features:\r\n  <ul>\n<li>A complete story with ending</li><li>3 to 4 hours of playtime</li><li>Storybook-style visuals</li>\n<li>42 CGs (+ a cinematic ending sequence)</li>\n<li>5 ways to violently die!</li>\n<li>Lots of dramatic sound effects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remaining arcs will be released once they're finished (the game is still in production). Stay tuned for devlogs or check out my Twitter for production updates and information on future release dates.</p>\n<strong>CONTENT WARNINGS</strong>\n<p>Our Wonderland is recommended for mature audiences only.
