Made in GameMaker, the game draws a lot of inspiration from Music producer \"Dj Khaled\" and has quite the comedic theme in reference to Dj Khaled's iconic social status on social media. You must tactically avoid \"They\" (The people that don't want you to win) while collecting the keys to success. The keys to success are placed throughout each room/level and \"they won't make it easy for you to get them\". You will be challenged by the likes of these haters in order to \"win, win, win\" just like the Khaled himself. Dj Khaled is an inspiration worth acknowledging, and when playing this maze game, you will be accompanied by his wisdom.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29c/29c2eac578e5c4a34577bbb6f449c45c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itsyoboit"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
