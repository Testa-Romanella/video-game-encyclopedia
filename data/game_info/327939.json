Within a simulated patient encounter, you will experience the short-term and long-term impact of your clinical choices.</p>\n<p>This case is centered around school teacher Andrea Sanchez, who is having trouble getting off a combined hydrocodone with acetaminophen medication. In this clinical simulation, you will make choices as a primary care prescriber\u00a0and experience outcomes based on the choices you make. You will be challenged to:</p>\n<ul><li>Discuss Ms. Patel's personal health habits\u00a0</li><li>Identify and treat any medical problems you uncover</li></ul>\n<p>You will complete typical steps of a patient encounter and receive feedback after each step:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Review case history\u00a0</li><li>Complete an evaluation, diagnosis, and brief intervention\u00a0</li><li>Make a plan of care for your patient</li></ul>\n<p>Feedback is color-coded to let you know whether you made the best selection, a less than ideal selection, or an incorrect selection. With the ability to retry a section or continue down paths to see impacts of different decisions, you will learn by doing without causing real-world negative outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Who We Are:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The\u00a0<em>CE: PainTx\u00a0</em>suite of cases were developed by Clinical Tools, Inc. through a NIDA grant (\u00a0#1R44DA035042\u00a0).
