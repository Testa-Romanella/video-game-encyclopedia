How about one that sneezes?  But the fun doesn't stop there, Booger Tap is a fast paced, reflex-testing, game.  While this isn't a tower defense game, you are tapping to defend yourself from something else: boogers.<br/><br/>Try this addicting game and see how long you can \"ride the bull\" so to speak.  Click the boogers as fast as you can.   If 20 boogers are on the screen, the baby cries and the game is over!  You'll get a little help from the magic \"Golden Tissue\" which clears all the boogers.<br/><br/>Booger Tap tracks the high scores of you and your friends. It is harder than it looks! How long can you go?<br/><br/>Try Other Bimza Games:<br/>Keno Gold<br/>Keno Trek<br/>Keno Fairy<br/>Keno Tap<br/>eXtra Keno<br/>Blame", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/945/9458131d583c9a11d342ff0a18bbb00d.jpg", "website": "http://www.bimza.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bimza"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Bimza"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
