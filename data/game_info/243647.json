The aim is to paint the boxes as quickly as possible. The quicker you paint each box, the higher the score. If the painter touches any of the \"chasers\" the game is over. It takes fast reactions and timing to complete the game with a high score.<br/><br/>There are three difficulty levels to choose from: <br/>- Easy has one chaser who will chase the hero<br/>- Interesting level adds a second chaser who will move randomly around the board<br/>- Hard has two chasers who will attempt to pincer the painter into a corner", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T07:21:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/904/904a4dfc19b9dec7133d6cf97fddf0e4_BzauHYh.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kevin Ainley-Walker"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kevin Ainley-Walker"], "esrb_rating": null}
