I am a 21 year old physicist in training from Belgium, when I\u2019m not discovering the laws of the universe I like to work on my game development.<br/>In the past few years I have worked on several smaller projects but nothing on the scale of Drop Out. During this time, i learned how to work with Unity and Blender which culminated in Drop Out 0.<br/>No matter what career I might choose in the future, I am very passionate about making games, so you might see a new title pop up on Steam in a few years. Expect something wildly different though!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Special thanks to:<br/>Doug Bryant (BulletMagnet) for the weapon models and teaching me how to model better, <br/>Marnick39 for helping with coding, ideas and balancing, <br/>Unity for their buggy game engine, PhotonEngine for their equally buggy networking code. <br/>Thanks to the testing team, including CubicWarrior, Deraldo, Tafikay, Woxic, Patat, Joey, Anivia, hallway A1 and the FunnyJunk community!<br/>Music by Louis Davita (check out his soundcloud).<br/>Additional music by Kevin Macleod, and Adrian Von Ziegler.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70cf064c9bb4c80950ed9aaddc6ccce7.jpg", "website": "http://wardddev.com/Drop%20Out%200.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 27}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ward Dehairs"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ward Dehairs"], "esrb_rating": null}
