It seems like only yesterday the two love birds were escaping from an exploding laboratory in the sky. Now it\u2019s the current year, and they\u2019ve welcomed their daughter Nugget into the world. Their peaceful days enjoying life as a family came to an abrupt end when Dr. Fetus beat the snot out of them with a rusty shovel, and kidnapped Nugget! Now it\u2019s up to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl to rescue their daughter from a lunatic fetus in a jar that can only be described as an incel version of Tony Stark.<br />\nSuper Meat Boy Forever is the sequel to Super Meat Boy! This is a new experience that eclipses the original. Don\u2019t stare directly at it unless you still have your eclipse glasses.<br />\n7200 individually handcrafted levels combine dynamically to give you a new challenge every single time you play. Seven thousand two hundred levels. They said we couldn\u2019t do it, but we did. Who\u2019s they? Don\u2019t ask. They don\u2019t like it when you ask.<br />\nIt\u2019s hard, but fair. Nothing in life worth having comes easy. Just ask Dark Soulman.<br />\nMeat Boy and Bandage Girl can fight back. It\u2019s time to unleash the raw fury of parenthood on their foes just like Liam Neeson in that documentary about his family vacation in Paris.<br />\nBigger boss battles than before. Your mind will be blown. Your socks will be blown off. Team Meat is not liable for any of this.<br />\nBrand new art with stunning detail and resolution. There are a lot of pixels in here. Grab the biggest display you have and watch those dots change color rapidly with gumption. Don\u2019t sit too close though. (If your parents aren\u2019t home you can sit as close as you want we won\u2019t tell, but Team Meat is still not liable for any of this.)<br />\nA soundtrack composed by Ridiculon so intense that the state of Wyoming has issued a ban on all audio devices capable of playing it out of fear that just a single note will cause the dormant super volcano beneath Yellowstone to erupt ushering in a new age of darkness.<br />\nFrame by frame artisan crafted in game animations, and animated cutscenes that will make you experience procedurally generated emotions.<br />\nA story so rich and moving that it makes Citizen Kane look like an unboxing video for a dehumidifier.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-19T21:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cfd/cfd1a22d99761c68ff40fa3484b5d72c.jpg", "website": "http://www.supermeatboy.com/", "rating": 2.48, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 54, "owned": 231, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 36, "dropped": 22, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 29, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 33, "platforms": ["iOS", "Nintendo Switch", "Android", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Headup Games", "Team Meat", "Thunderful Publishing"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Thunderful Publishing", "Team Meat"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
