{"id": 834622, "slug": "no-guarantee", "name": "No Guarantee", "name_original": "No Guarantee", "description": "<p>A bit-life sort of game that I've been working on for some time - fun to play on pc and on mobile. It's a text-based game that simulates the financial and survival side of living. The goal is to get as rich as possible. Everything is out to get you here though! Maintain your thirst and hunger by purchasing food and water - while of course trying to get the money to buy this stuff. You can get sacked from\u00a0 your job - your house could get damaged - your investment maybe a failure, the beauty of this game is that nothing that you do is certain to work out - hence the name - No Guarantee!</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________</p>\n<p>It's not likely that new features will be a regular occurrence - however they will happen eventually! Patches however will be a regular thing.</p>\n<p>How can you get involved?</p>\n<p>If you see a bug then feel free to say, and a patch will come out shortly (hopefully anyways) - also if you would like to see a feature that you think would fit the game very well, then also mention it in the comments, and someday it might come true!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T13:57:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4faf05db7668d7d559b9882db2212a10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["MInecraftPro9io"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
