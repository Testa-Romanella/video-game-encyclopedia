Left click operates, uses, picks things up, and walks, while right click examines things.<br/>At the top of the screen in game is an inventory menu, as well as a menu with saving, loading, and a volume slider.\u00a0<br/>All dialogue is passed with a mouse click or any key pressed.<br/>At various points you will have an item that upon examining (right click) will allow you to switch characters at will. This can be important.</p>\n<p>[FEEDBACK]<br/>If you're feeling like a constructive human being, inside is a .doc file which can be filled out and emailed back to me for feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is very helpful for me to continue making games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for participating,</p>\n<p>-Fransis &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32d/32df0403d1f4a260691f8f46f79444c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thinking of Cremation?"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
