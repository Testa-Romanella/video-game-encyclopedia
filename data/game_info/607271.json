You may notice the table is a bit large however the\u00a0table is made of multiple 8x8 sprites. The background textures aren't 8x8 tho, I assumed this was an exception to the rule.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Recommended to play on fullscreen. This my first finished game jam so tell me how you like it! The bugs are plentiful on this one\u00a0;)<br/><br/>Mr. Whiskers hasn't been fed on time! Now at the crack of midnight he shall take his revenge by throwing everything off the table. </p>\n<p>As Mr. Whisker's your goal is to throw <strong>everything\u00a0</strong>off the table, before the timer runs out, and Mr. Whiskers\u00a0owner returns. There are 5 levels for Mr. Whiskers to Meticulously plot his revenge.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Controls; 'A' and 'D' to move, as well as 'W' to jump. Press 'P' to push objects.
