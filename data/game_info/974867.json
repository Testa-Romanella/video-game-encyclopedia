After you press attack, your troops will begin to move towards the enemy tower to attack it and take control of it.<br/>\r\nYou can control the number of troops with which you will attack the tower, assessing your capabilities and weaknesses. If you send too few troops, the chance of victory will be low, and if you send too many, you may lose a large number of your warriors.<br/>\r\nIn order to complete the level, the player must capture all the towers.<br/>\r\nThe game has a unique troop accumulation system, which means that you can only deal with troop management.
