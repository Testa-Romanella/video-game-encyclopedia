{"id": 661041, "slug": "brainshots", "name": "BrainShots", "name_original": "BrainShots", "description": "<p>This game is based on the theme \"reflection\" and \"colour\". The player has to complete the maze and track and kill the enemies who are patrolling. The only way to do that is by hitting them with a bullet of the same colour. If the bullet is initially blue, to hit the enemy coloured cyan, you have to hit the bullet on a green mirror first. As blue + green gives cyan, you will get a cyan bullet, which will destroy the enemy.</p><p>A guide for the tutorial level:</p>\n<p>After you reach the robot enemy, you need to create a cyan bullet from your blue bullet. There is a mirror right in front of the corridor the robot is in, which is coloured green. You have to reflect the bullet off the green mirror and make it hit the robot. The later levels also follow a similar logic, but with different colours. The key is indicated in the top right corner of the screen.</p>\n<p>Source Code:-\u00a0https://github.com/IDoEverything/Brainshots</p>\n<p>Made with &lt;3 by Exun Clan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T21:00:11", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mananforexun"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
