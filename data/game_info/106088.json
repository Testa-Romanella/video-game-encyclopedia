{"id": 106088, "slug": "blindfield", "name": "Blindfield", "name_original": "Blindfield", "description": "<p>A game about two blind people searching for treasure in a minefield.</p>\n<p>This game requires an audience. Two players share an Xbox controller, holding one side each behind their backs. They should stand so they are unable to see the screen.</p>\n<p>The audience should be able to see the screen and be heard by the players (but turn the volume up loud).</p>\n<p>Each player controls one of the coloured circles on the screen. They both have metal detectors that work in different ways. One of them has a long range detector that vibrates when they are moving in the direction of the treasure, but gets weaker as it gets closer. The other has a short range detector that gets stronger, the closer it gets to the treasure. When both players are standing on the treasure, they win.</p>\n<p>The audience's job is to guide the two players, to help them find each other without stepping on any mines. </p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>Made by Aaron Oostdijk, Will McMain, Valdemar Andreasen, Malena Klaus, and erbridge, during #splashjam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11a4500b12290132b6c0a641e5f5bb43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["erbridge", "Silent Panda", "Malena Klaus", "aaronvark", "willmcmain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
