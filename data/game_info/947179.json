The player will be flying. The game is about friendship between the player and the mythical creatures.\"Chat GPT:<br/>Sure, here's an idea for a short and simple game that  incorporates  chupacabras, bigfoot, and a merman, with the player flying  and the  game focusing on friendship between the player and the  creatures:  <br/><br/>Title: \"Cryptid Companions\" <br/><br/>Gameplay: You play as a flying character who  has befriended three  different cryptids - chupacabras, bigfoot, and a  merman. Your objective  is to fly with each of them and collect items  that they need to complete  a special task. <br/><br/>In each level, you'll fly  with one of the cryptids. The chupacabra level  will have you flying  through a forest area, collecting berries that the  chupacabra needs for  its family. The bigfoot level will require you to  fly through  mountainous terrain, collecting wood that the bigfoot needs  for its  home. In the merman level, you'll have to fly through an  underwater  cave, collecting pearls that the merman needs for its  treasure  collection. <br/><br/>As you collect the items, you'll need to avoid obstacles and  enemies  that try to stop you. Once you've collected all the items,  you'll  deliver them to the cryptid and they'll reward you with a  special item  that will help you in the next level. <br/><br/>The game focuses on  the idea of friendship and cooperation between  different creatures,  showing that even mythical creatures can have bonds  with humans.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T08:45:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20b/20b20b5cb9fe2e7855abd21cdb92427b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["NvrSkipGameDay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
