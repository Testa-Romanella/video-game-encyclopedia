Higher score is better.</p>\n<p>You can move left and right using A/D or the left and right arrow keys, jump using W, up arrow,\u00a0or space. Pause the game at any time using escape.</p>\n<p>\r\nHave fun! Also, it can get pretty difficult as the game progresses, but every sector IS possible, I\u00a0have beat every sector without cheating.</p>\n<p>Source:\u00a0https://github.com/Heavenly47/time-stuff</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T07:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fee/feef502aaaca2505a457beac726b751d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heavenly47"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
