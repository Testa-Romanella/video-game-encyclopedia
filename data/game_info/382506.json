Other resolutions are not supported, sorry.</p>\n<p>The game features a half working level editor/custom level system. It will work if you line everything up, but if you do something wrong the game may lock up or break. I ran out of time to polish the custom level system, apologies. If you do manage to make a level successfully, I'd love to see you post it in the comments here or on the LDJam page.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing, please, relax and have fun. There is no rush, there is no stress, just you and your mind.<br/></p>\n<p>Music created by Hakita</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T10:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ff/6ffa21215d9d975779c5d733a16563ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EmptyStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
