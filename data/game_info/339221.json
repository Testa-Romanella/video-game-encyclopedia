If you don't attack with one bat for a short period of time, it'll charge up and do massive throwback damage to a target when attack! The brighter the bat, the better the damage. <br/><strong><br/>Developed for SteamVR/OpenVR. Should be compatible with any SteamVR/OpenVR compatible headset. Windows x64 only. </strong><br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>- Back Trigger: Hold onto Bat. Releasing this releases the bat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Your hands and arms: Swinging the bat (duh). <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Sound effects originally created by artisticdude (you can find them here)</p>\n<p>This game uses the Steam VR Plugin for Unity provided by Valve</p>\n<p>Programming and 3D assets - Parkraft</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T06:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc36ae2c91fbac7ff8196dc8d9ae8fa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["parkraft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
