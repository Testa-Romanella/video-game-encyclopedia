You play Ivan the Terrible, tsar of Russia in the 16th century. There is quite a bit of contention in the historical community as to whether Ivan was mad or not. This is asked because one of the major creations of his reign, the Oprichnina, was a horribly oppressive tool used to execute thousands of people without due cause, or for \"treasonous\" reasons. Was Ivan mad and paranoid, or were there underlying reasons for his betrayal to his nobles and the people of Russia? Find out!</p><p>Thanks to HIST3812A for inspiring me to create this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clamchowder101"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
