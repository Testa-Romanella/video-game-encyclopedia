When you entered the hole, the entrance caved in. Find your way up by climbing the rocks and getting back home!</p><p>this is a very short game about 2-10 minutes long. It's a parkour game with simple jumping. Some jumps may be hard for some people and there are no checkpoints, so you might rage a little.</p><p><strong>*MUSIC IN THE VIDEO IS NOT IN THE GAME*</strong></p><p>This is my first game so please don't scream at me...</p><p>I was twelve when i created this game. Took a few weeks to make.</p><p>Yeah there's no audio or sound at all lol</p><p>You might be able to climb over the \"mountains\" and get out of the map.</p><p>I took some inspiration from some other parkour game and i really like the low poly art style.</p><p>This game was made in Unity Personal Edition, all the models were made by me in Blender.</p><p>I might not work on this game and fix bugs and glitches. I will be working on another game or on schoolwork.</p><p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p><p><em>WASD to walk</em></p><p><em>LEFT SHIFT to sprint</em></p><p><em>Mouse to look around</em></p><p><em>SPACE to jump</em></p><p><em>ESC to pause</em></p><p><strong>Please visit my website:</strong></p><p>http://snailnugget.weebly.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/549f0897f8f37202a092347f1ed28d9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SnailNugget"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
