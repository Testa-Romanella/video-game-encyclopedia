{"id": 64528, "slug": "zap-zap-zombie-cats", "name": "Zap Zap Zombie Cats", "name_original": "Zap Zap Zombie Cats", "description": "You are one of the few survivors of a zombie cat-pocalypse.  With only your wits, your weapons, and a few turrets, you must defend yourself from the hordes of zombie-cats that come at night.  Grenade, blast, shoot, heal, and place traps to survive each wave until safety comes with the sunlight.<br/><br/>This is Zap Zap Zombie Cats.  A mix between a turret defense game and an FPS.  Gameplay is split into two parts: a day portion where you must build and upgrade various turrets during the day to prepare for the night invasion, and a night portion where you take place in the action from a stationary position atop your base.  During this stage, you can switch between 3 various cats, each with a different weapon and ability to utilize against the horde.<br/><br/>Zap Zap was made from a team of college students looking to gain experience and learn about the game-making process.  We know the game won't be perfect, but we hope to improve our skills and greatly appreciate any and all feedback from players.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/>3 Characters, each with their own unique weapon and ability,<br/>8 Different enemies,<br/>13 Turret types,<br/>3 levels of upgrade per turret,<br/>and 10 levels with a tutorial and boss stage", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d21/d21a2d0587f4f97c3eb58015c6ddd8d9.jpg", "website": "http://zapzapzombiecats.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 113, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hang Time Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hang Time Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
