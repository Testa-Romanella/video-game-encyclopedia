The game takes a lot of inspiration from the game <strong>Gradius</strong>. Your aim in the game is to kill every enemy that you encounter very easily.<br/></p><p>Storyline<br/></p><p>The year is 2040...</p>\n<p>The world is under great threat. There is a terrible war in space. In order to stop this war and put its limits to the psychopaths who caused it, we need the legendary ship called Andromeda, which is said to be in Spacia. Everyone is after this ship. A British hero named Bandit Star found the place where the spaceship was, in two months, and managed to somehow escape from everyone. As the Bandit Star, Andromeda is now yours and the fate of the world is in your hands. Activate power relays and fire.</p>\n<p>'My little friend, there are no good people left in this world. Now this is a swamp full of evil.'</p>\n<p>Whether you use Andromeda or not. But know that no matter what your choice is, you cannot escape from war.\"</p><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e9/5e9565a7e3925282d5f9b3b43e3e6b5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Sunflower\u306e\u4e16\u754c"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
