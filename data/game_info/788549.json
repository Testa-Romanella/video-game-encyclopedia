It\u00a0was inspired by <em>1984</em> by George Orwell <em>and The City of Silence</em> by Ma Boyong.\u00a0In the two novels, people\u2019s speech is being surveillance and censored by a higher authority, a 'Big Brother'. </p>\n<p>The 'Big Brothers' limits what people can say and express. \u00a0This is the perfect dystopia scenario that comes to most people\u2019s minds when we talk about censorship. But is that how the 'Big Brothers' really are?\r\n</p>\n<p>For the interaction and visual part, I chose one of the most classic game ever - the Tetris. Tetris is a game with simple rules and a clear goal, yet it's possible to create a great impact on the game experience with only a few changes to the rule.\u00a0 There are 7 types of tetrominoes in Tetris and the player play it by\u00a0methodically structuring these blocks \u2013 just like how we arrange our speeches! In\u00a0<em>The City of Silence</em>, more and more words are censored until there\u2019s nothing left but silence. Such dramatic censorship was\u00a0represented here by removing certain patterns from the block pool.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the most part of the game, the player will be dealing with a Big Brother who tries to prevent the player from expressing (reaching the goal score) by banning more and more blocks. However, the beauty of Tetris proves that simply removing blocks will indeed increase the difficulty of the game but it will not stop the player from winning. So in the final stage, when the player finally beats the \u2018Big Brother\u2019, they will play one more round, but the interface has changed to a typical social media style. This time, there\u2019s no more limitation, all blocks are available. However, they\u00a0will find the blocks secretly\u00a0twisted away from their intention\u00a0by the system, this will raise the difficulty to win to a ridiculous height, but without banning a single pattern! This is how the real \u2018Big Brothers\u2019 - the social media censor the message people express:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>The real \u2018Big Brothers\u2019 might not ban your speech, but they twist how it's shown.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T15:50:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/148fbccea418d6e88994376847443bc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["GForce01"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
