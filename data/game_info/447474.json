Your heavy spacesuit makes jumping difficult, so timing is essential to avoid the alien life forms.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME 2</strong><br/>Drive your vehicle around the landscape and reach all the survey locations. Beware the natural dust storms and power couplings that will damage your craft on contact.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME 3</strong><br/>Use your slow hovver-pod to ascend the towers - keep an eye out for the connection points to install satellite dishes, but watch for the robots dumping their construction garbage.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME 4</strong><br/>Escape the planet through the derelict buildings that are now overrun by masses of malfunctioning droids. Use the one-way gravity chutes but watch where you\u2019re going!\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>Aeon \u00a92018 Sunteam.
