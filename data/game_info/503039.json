We never found the time to finish it, and I didn't know where to go with the writing.</p>\n<p> After going through some really difficult mental health crises, I'm hoping to take a break from my usual work and spend some time with these dogs and their antics. I think I've found the story I want to tell with them, now. I hope you'll support me on this venture!</p>\n<p>Purchases through here and Patreon support will fund the development of this game directly. Final versions probably won't include keyboard-playing since I'll be working on this solo and I only have a Ukulele, haha!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12a/12afcbf38814e380428373f2ba870196.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hien Pham"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
