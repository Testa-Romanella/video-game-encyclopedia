Dances with Butterflies lets you stand in a clearing in the forest and conduct clouds of monarch butterflies to music.

Conduct to The Monarch Waltz by Cliff Eastabrook - or use the music in your head.<br/><br/>Take a break from the carnage of other games. Clear your head by standing in a mountain glade and gently conduct wafting clouds of beautiful monarch butterflies. Or start your day with five meditative minutes of peace and tranquility.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae33661e034109a1ed5ab40d223df202.jpg", "website": "http://www.jrobson.me", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan Robson", "Matthew Hayter"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Jonathan Robson"], "esrb_rating": null}
