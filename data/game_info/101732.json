For every packet of data stolen, you gain one point. By racing your chosen virus through the maze of circuitry inside the server, you implement glitches into the system, temporarily affecting your control of the virus, but increasing your multiplier by opening up more ports for the data to flow through.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nAim:<p>\nRace through the track and get to the end with as many points as possible\r\n</p>\r\nHow:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Keep an eye on the <strong>Timer</strong>. The more time you have left, the more points you will get</li>\n<li>Activate the <strong>Glitches</strong>!! You see the little orange things on the track that screw you over? They are your friend. Activating them will give you a negative impact, but it will add to your score multiplier</li>\n<li>Try not to fall off ;) Each time you fall off you lose 1x multiplier</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p>\nControls:<p>\n<strong>WASD \u2013</strong>\tAccelerate/Brake/Left/Right<br/>\n<strong>Arrow Keys \u2013</strong> Menu Navigation<br/>\n<strong>Enter \u2013 </strong>Confirm Selection\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Mouse <strong>\u2013</strong></strong> Currently used for the leader board at the end of the game.
