May the biggest cult win.<br/></p>\n<p>My entry for the Weekly Game Jam #139 (theme: followers).</p>\r\nSummary\r\n<p>Cult Wars is a 2D top-down round-based arena fighter with a battle-royale-like element. You play as a cult leader and\r\n    \"defeat\" enemy cult followers in order to convert them to your own cult. Each round is time-based and\r\n    after each round\r\n    you tally up the cult followers and begin the next round with your new followers.</p>\n<p>The goal is to be the last cult standing with all the followers following your every command.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Input\r\n            Action\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            WASD\r\n            Move\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Space/LMB\r\n            Attack\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            M\r\n            Toggle music\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            ESC\r\n            Quit game\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\nGame Jam Post Mortem\r\n<p>This project was part of the Weekly Game Jam for week #139 where the theme was <em>Followers</em>. I decided to use\r\n    this project to improve my skill with Unreal Engine 4, particularly the 2D aspect of it. I also wanted to run solo\r\n    since I want to use game jams to specifically improve my own abilities in every aspect of game development and raise\r\n    the bar for myself.</p>\n<p>Every asset (except for fonts and some built-in UI elements) was made by myself during the jam duration. This\r\n    includes code, sprites, and audio.</p>\n<p>The following things are aspects of the engine that I had very little experience with or had never touched until now:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper2D flipbooks</li>\n<li>Collision in 2D space</li>\n<li>Behavior Trees and AI Tasks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout the project I also took the opportunity to experiment with using both Semantic Commit Messages and the Gamemakin UE4 Style Guide by Allar which worked fairly well\r\n    and helped keep things organized.</p>\r\nImprovements\r\n<p>As with any game jam time is of the essence, and as such a few features had to be cut that I would've liked to\r\n    include but had no time to.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sound FX\r\n        <ul>\n<li>I didn't want to use premade sfx and so there are none as I did not have time to create and properly\r\n                attenuate things like hit and death sounds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Feedback effects (hit/death particle systems, screen shake etc.)\r\n        <ul>\n<li>This would've helped a lot to set it apart as a more polished slice. Right now, the gameplay feel is a\r\n                bit lacking.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Pathfinding/Collision avoidance\r\n        <ul>\n<li>Right now, all AI followers can easily clump which makes things a bit too easy. They also just follow\r\n                their target straight without any prediction or ambushing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Abilities/bonuses\r\n        <ul>\n<li>A system for gaining perks as the rounds progress would've made things a bit more interesting. Things\r\n                like movement buffs, new attacks etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Animations (idle, run, etc.)</li>\n<li>Minimap (so you don't get lost and can focus your movement better)</li>\n<li>Improved UI (always see current followers etc.)</li>\n<li>Main Menu</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eeb/eeb4649b9e233fe87a07637a755ce776.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Master Kenth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
