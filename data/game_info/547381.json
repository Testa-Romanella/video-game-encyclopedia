The theme was \"locked\", and so I decided to implement that into the mechanics of only being able to hold one item at a time, as well as a theme in the story. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>That weird gray oval on some dialogue popups? No idea what it is. It's probably a simple fix with one setting somewhere, but I couldn't find it.</li><li>Picking up the gold key automatically unlocks the gold door.</li><li>If you leave and re-enter the sapphire key puzzle room, you return to the room in a solved state. This can also cause duplicate the sapphire key if you already got it.</li></ul><p>The last two bugs didn't occur in engine (Godot). Perhaps they would've been corrected if I used a downloadable export instead, but I like the easier access of playing the games in browser, so I left it this way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T08:22:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a8/6a824533eee02e31c527e70b793db6cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HolyWhales"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
