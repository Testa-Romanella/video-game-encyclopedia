{"id": 716235, "slug": "nyctophobia-itch-drnefarius", "name": "Nyctophobia (itch) (DrNefarius)", "name_original": "Nyctophobia (itch) (DrNefarius)", "description": "<p>Accompany Jonathan into the mysterious depths of an abandoned laboratory in an attempt to figure out who...or what reduced the research facility to these conditions. Secrets, new dimensions and, possibly, the end of the world as we know it...</p>\n<p>The game offers exploration and puzzle solving dynamics, which will be more present in the finished game. The game takes place in a dark setting but not without a hint of humor (which I just couldn't do without, apparently).</p>\n<p>I really hope you'll like it. I worked on it really hard. I'm not a game dev, nor a coder, but I like creating stories, and this was a fun way to tell one! I'll eventually work on finding a crew with the skills to deliver better products, but it will take time and (depending on my charisma) money to hire them! If you liked this experiment enough to help me doing better, you can support me on the game's Patreon!<br/>ATTENTION: The game may take a while to load. There's not much I can do about it. Also the in-game lighting isn't really the best. Unluckily that's what I have to work with and, believe me, it's annoying for me as well. I hope I'll be able to afford better equipment and programs in the future.</p>\n<p>All the sites I have used appear in the credits.</p>\n<p>Songs' credits:</p>\n<p>Sings In The Fields by Rafael Krux</p>\n<p>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/5302-sings-in-the-fields-</p>\n<p>License:https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Mysterious Fear by MusicLFiles</p>\n<p>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/7108-mysterious-fear</p>\n<p>License:https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T05:48:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be0/be051585bf3070d6098700a57e9ef3bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DrNefarius"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
