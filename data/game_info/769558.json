I think I succeeded. <br/></p>\n<p>Introducing Thinking with Skateboards, a... game, where you try to get a high score on the skating course, but alongside regular skateboarding, you can also use a portal gun! I have absolutely no idea what all you can do with this. Please, surprise me.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This is not a real game in full development, and I have no intention at this point in time in turning it into a Real Game, but if I were to try that, I would probably not rely on the Unreal Marketplace resources I used.<br/></p>\n<p>If you wanna be there \u00a0the next time I do a weird design stream like that, follow me on twitch.tv/dnallohleoj. This is not my business itch page and I do not accept donations through here, you'd have to go to ko-fi.com/dnallohleoj for that. <br/></p>\n<p>And, credit where it's due, these are the Marketplace resources I used:</p>\n<p>A Basic Skateboard Kit:\u00a0https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/basic-skateboard</p>\n<p>Portal Gun/Portals: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/portal-gun-01</p>\n<p>Stylized Character Kit: Casual 01:\u00a0https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/stylized-male-character-k...<br/></p>\n<p>The thing I used as a portal gun is a free model from kenney.nl/</p>\n<p>Some textures were free samples from\u00a0 gametextures.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T06:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49c/49c20b2ba63ee6058778b9b52df28f96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joel Holland"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
