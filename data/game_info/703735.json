Units can be bought from the shop using the energy that is granted per round and then placed in formation on the field. Upon starting the round, your team fights against the AI generated team that progressively gets larger as the rounds go on.\u00a0 A base reward of two energy is granted every round, with a bonus two energy provided on wins, and one on draws.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Battles</strong></p>\n<p>The round battles begin by moving any units from the above or below lanes towards the middle lane, before the units closest to the enemy units launching their attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Future</strong></p>\n<p>As state, this game was created during the GoGodot game jam, and although beset by real life duties and work life, I enjoyed working on this project.
