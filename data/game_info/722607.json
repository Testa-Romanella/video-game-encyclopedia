I plan on turning this game prototype to be my first IOS game. I want to spruce up the art and textures\u00a0and remake a number of my assets as well as add more to the scene involving different types of obstacles as well as more playable dog types. My final version of this will also have more movements such as jumping and sliding. So please if you have and suggestion or anything about this game, I am really looking to hear feedback.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T10:41:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1de411b2fccdb276cc95c87c116e929.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Danyel Dev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
