First of all <em>I suggest</em> to download a playable for better performance and quality. The HTML5 version has (little) downscaled graphics as well as only stereo sound. However you can still play the game in the browser. The mouse rotation can be stuck at one direction\u00a0when using 2 monitors and playing the game in browser.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a short game which plays in a forest. You ultimate goal is to survive the night. I also suggest to find out how to win on your own.\u00a0 In case you dont want to, or you feel stuck read the following section</strong></p>\n<p><em>(This is the first game i published - your feedback is appreciated. Maybe the mechanics are\u00a0unobvious to you etc.)</em></p>\r\nHow to win\r\n<p><strong>So you don't want to find it out yourself hum? Here is how to win:</strong></p>\n<p>You have to collect <em>coins,\u00a0</em>which randomly spawn at different locations of the map. The amount of coins you need varies. You can look that up on the slotmachine once it's powered. To power it you need to activate the platform by stepping onto it.</p>\n<p>If you have found all coins and successfully inserted them into the coin machine, the night is over and you have won.</p>\n<p>There are 7 locations where you can find coins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T03:31:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/2997a9660604716356702a167e8457fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["NeroStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
