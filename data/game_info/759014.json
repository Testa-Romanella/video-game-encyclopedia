Free Roam", "description": "<p>For the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2, I submitted the game Let There Be Nuts!\u00a0For that game, I got a lot of feedback from people suggesting that I should've let the player explore the city a bit more without the timer. Well recently I've been learning how to create multiplayer games with Mirror and I decided I should make a simple First Person game where you can explore that city\u00a0with your friends!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This isn't the first time I've tried my hand at multiplayer.\u00a0A while back\u00a0I had followed Tom Weiland's YouTube tutorials on how to create a multiplayer game from scratch. It was a very informative series, but it was also one of the hardest concepts I've ever had to learn!</p>\n<p>With his series, I was able to create my very own version of 3D Among Us just like Dani did in his video. I was extremely proud of this accomplishment, so much that I made a video about it on my YouTube channel, MrMacNova.\u00a0Multiplayer development is NOT easy. However, it can be made easier. That's why I began learning Mirror.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to play this game on your own, just extract the zip file and launch the game! If you want to play with your friends, just make a Steam account and follow the steps below. There's not much to do at the moment besides run around, but if you have any ideas on what I can do with this project let me know!</p>\n<p>MULTIPLAYER SETUP:<br/>1. Open up your Steam Library.<br/>2. At the bottom left of the launcher click \"Add a game\" and select \"Add a non-Steam game\"<br/>3. Click \"Browse\" and search for \"Runners.exe<br/>4. Click \"Add selected\"<br/>5. You should now be able to launch the game and host your own lobby. Use the Steam Overlay to join or invite your friends!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/>WASD - Move<br/>Shift - Sprint<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Ctrl/C - Crouch/Slide<br/>You can also use a gamepad to play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T07:55:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/691/69191445aa37804f233e33cb06227e8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["m-casa"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
