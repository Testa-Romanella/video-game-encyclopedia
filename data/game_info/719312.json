Also, game has several enemy types with unique behaviors.</p>\n<p>This is literally my first game, so I make it for practice, but I liked the result so much I decided to finalize\u00a0and show it. Cirkill was made with C++ programming language, using SFML library.</p>\n<p>The real challenge of the game is speedruning.
