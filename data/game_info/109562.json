Experience the deafening silence that allows The One True King to remain 100% focused and numb to the world - and opinions of thousands of sane people that he should really be listening to - around him.</p><p>- NO CONTROLS: Experience the absolute power of being a god among some lesser forms of garden cabbage. You can't be controlled, you cannot be stopped. It's a wonder nobody's built a wall around you yet.</p><p>- VR SUPPORT: Those lucky enough to have VR headsets can become one with The One True King and truly appreciate his glory.*</p><p>* We would like to note that this has not been tested. We would also like to remind any persons that may endure long exposure to the simulation that Mexicans are, in fact, people and that relations with ones daughter are generally frowned upon.</p><p>We constantly seek to better this simulation. Please leave your feedback.</p><p>PATCH NOTES:</p><p>v1.01: </p><p>- Fixed a bug where flecks of humanity would appear in the simulation</p><p>v1.02 </p><p>- Added a feature where one can become complete oblivious to social etiquette and their own haircut</p><p>- Fixed a bug where the player would go and vote for The One True King</p><p>Made by @LewersClark for the 2016 1BIT JAM.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LewisClark"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
