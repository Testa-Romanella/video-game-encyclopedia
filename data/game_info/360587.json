{"id": 360587, "slug": "dungeon-of-restraint", "name": "Dungeon of Restraint", "name_original": "Dungeon of Restraint", "description": "<p>A Puzzle Game made in RPG Maker for the GMTK 2019 Game Jam.</p>\n<p>In the game, your task is to clear out the enemies in the dungeon without killing any of them. To do this, you have to get them down to\u00a0 <strong>only one</strong> HP, and they will flee after your next turn. Planning around this, and the unusual damage abilities you have, makes this more of a puzzle game than an RPG.</p>\n<p>Download the zip file, unpack it, and launch the game.exe to play. I recommend playing with the mouse, which allows you to target your character with your skills by clicking on their portait on the bottom of the screen. Make sure to save after each battle too.</p><p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong> \u00a0The end cutscene trigger somehow ended on the wrong trigger type. When you reach the final room, to trigger the final cutscene stand on the row with the last pillars and press the confirm button (either Z key or Left Click). Fortunatly there is no additional gameplay after this point but its a bit of a bum note to have no ending and I'm not sure if I'm allowed to patch it during the Jam. I apologise for the inconvenience.<br/></p>\n<p>Uses plugins made by\u00a0Yanfly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T18:40:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/3187a67693573bb0f66c3ee3dc61f7d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paper Shadow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
