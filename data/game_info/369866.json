This dungeon crawler game changes every playthrough. Can you find the boss and battle your way to victory?</p>\n<p>---Devlog---</p>\n<p>This is my entry for the Extra Credits Game Jam 2019. The theme is: Passage. At first I thought of making players pass items (because PASSage)\u00a0in order to proceed to different places but it kinda feels like a stretch. So I\u00a0rethought the definition of passage which is an act of moving through something. And then I made\u00a0one player which can pass through doors to get keys. Which then the other player will use to open door so it can proceed.</p>\n<p>Any comments, suggestions, violent reactions, or anything are welcome. Thanks.</p>\n<p>*Disclaimer: Obviously I'm not great at art so sorry for the terrible look. :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T05:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2a/b2a1a2e8361090b2e1da070e508705e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CPOrt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
