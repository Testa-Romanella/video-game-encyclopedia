Their solution was simple: they turned themselves into pollution-eating mutants.</em></p>\n<p><em>Now, over half a century later, the rivers are blue again and the birds have learned new songs. A beautiful world is stepping out of the husk of the old.</em></p>\n<p><em>And the last waste-eater is waiting to die.<br/></em></p>\n<p>~~~~</p>\n<p>WASTE EATER is a 10-15 minute introspective about losing your humanity, and finding hope instead. Inspired by games like Far From Noise and Breathe.<br/></p>\n\r\n\r\nCredits<p>Developed on the stolen lands of the Kulin Nation.<br/></p>Silkscreen font by Jason Aleksandr Kottke\r\n<p>Homespun font by Brian Kent</p><p>Wind sound altered from Damien Devaux</p><p>Rain sound altered from Abinadi Meza</p><p>Thanks PoorDunce and Elissa Black for playtesting!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T06:00:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93f/93f5283f7576513c10a99f7e19076c93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["cain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
