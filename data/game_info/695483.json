What are the requirements to apply? What is the job even about?\u00a0<br/>To answer these questions, you got to experience the one and only, unique simulation.\u00a0<br/><br/>The game was made under 1 week. Most of the assets are premade, with the addition of unique sound effects, which were made by me and little creepy score. I deeply appreciate the support of my followers and every one else, who motivates me to make this type of games. Although, I must say this game has some requirements.\u00a0<br/><br/>WARNING!\u00a0<br/>The game contains flashing lights and super loud sound effects, so be aware.\u00a0<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY!<br/>Use W, A, S, D keys to move, mouse to look around and LMB to interact.\u00a0<br/><br/>THANKS FOR CHECKING OUT THE GAME.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T08:29:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be8/be879ecc80e4af77f651df89c15737ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niven Hedinger"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
