The theme was the environment, and I waste sorting really clicked with me.</li></ul>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<ul><li>Sort the waste in the correct bin (recyclable is the green one, hint, hint) and earn points.\u00a0</li><li>The recyclable waste is worth 2, while the non-recyclable is worth only one. I guess people who recycle\u00a0are a bit better than everyone else, after all.</li><li>Do this while avoiding the adorable carpinchos (as they're called over here, some may call them capybaras, others may know them as\u00a0<em>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).</em></li><li>Seriously, don't step on them. That's really mean.</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Use the left and right arrows to move around</li><li>Up arrow is used for jumping</li><li>ESC is for pausing the game, as according to the sacred tradition</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T07:18:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f7/4f7d58e8a7428ea9b422e23e006f520b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bruno Dorrian"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
