In A Space Shooter for Two Bucks! (a game with perhaps the most straight-forward title in history) you get to do just that. Take control of Commander P. Jefferson and go on an intergalactic shooting spree, hopping from galaxy to galaxy in your attempts to wipe out hordes of swarming alien baddies. With over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek humor from the game&#39;s wide cast of colorful characters (all of which are fully voiced-over) and loads of bodacious power-ups to ensure your ship has a fighting chance against the sea of enemy ships and bullets, A Space Shooter for Two Bucks! gives gamers everything they could ask for in a space shooter!</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2010-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-03T07:38:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/72a/72ac6313a71cf23796274543fc8bba82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "PSP"], "developers": ["Frima Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Frima Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
