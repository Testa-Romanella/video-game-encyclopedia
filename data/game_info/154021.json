Trying to come up with an idea, staring at my screen, I realized that a pixel must live in a small world.  And then I had the idea of a small pixel, about to die.  And nothing is worse on a monitor than a dead pixel.  So this is your chance to save a pixel from dying by feeding it reds, greens, and blues your other pixels share with it!</p><p>Controls are simple: WASD or Arrow Keys.  Thanks for playing!</p><p>LD Compo - Please vote if you can</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c9/4c937c6ae6236f891910a2d0efb0b8cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jasonlotito"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
