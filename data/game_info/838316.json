The robotic monsters hunting \u00a0you down will take parts out of your body if you get too close, forcing you to replace that part with a cybernetic one! In result, an automatic AI takes over the part of the gameplay that the body part was responsible of! (for example, if your legs are converted, you lose control of the movement, and an AI automatically moves you around!)</p>\n<p>However, you must reach the goal (a medical station) before becoming 100% robot, because then there will be no human parts to take DNA from in order to clone yourself a new fully human body!</p>\n<p>Explore the dark facility and, in the dark, dusty corners, find out what happened to its previous inhabitant ...</p>\n\n<p>The Theme:</p>\n<p>Wowie Jam 4.0 had the theme of \"Collaborate With AI\". This game incorporates it by having you collaborate with the AI in the gameplay and control of the character.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>I made the game myself, however some free assets (mainly audio) were also used:</p>\n<p>- Music: \"A Different World Below\" by Jonas Tyroller (the same Jonas who hosts the Wowie Jam!)</p>\n<p>- Art: Skull sprite taken from a dungeon art pack</p>\n<p>- Sound effects: impact sound effects by kenney<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:32:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/815/81513dbdf5cf7af600e842100c18ac61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["dardasaba"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
