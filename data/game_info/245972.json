Doing so awards points for the player so he can beat the current highscore.</p>\r\nCREATORS:\r\n<p>This game was created during autumn semester 2017 in Game Design &amp; Development, a 3-week course at Reykjavik University in autumn 2017.<br/><strong>The group</strong>:<br/>- Birkir \u00d6rn Karlsson<br/>- Erling Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Erlingsson<br/>- Hallur \u00d3lafsson<br/><strong>Teachers</strong>:<br/>- David Thue<br/>- Marco Bancale</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY:\r\n<p>The player uses keys WASD (and the arrow keys in the advanced stage) to switch between light states.<br/>Each key represents one traffic light which can either be red or green (wait or go).<br/>If drivers have to wait for too long at a traffic light, they'll start to get frustrated and the red meter (road rage meter) located in the top left corner of the screen starts to fill up. If the meter reaches 100% the player will lose.<br/>Coins randomly spawn on the roads and they all help the player in some way. Blue coins give the player an Ultimate ability which the user can use once per coin. Each map has different ultimates but they all clear the map of cars in the scene.<br/>The red coins lower the red meter and the gold coin awards the player with extra points.<br/>This build of the game includes three map which have varying difficulties.</p>\r\nCredits\r\nTextures:\r\n<p><strong>Lava Texture</strong><br/>https://dcrazed.com/best-free-seamless-background-textures/</p>\r\nAsset store Models:\r\n<p><strong>Fire and explosion Effect</strong><br/>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/73777<br/><strong>Trees</strong><br/>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/103208<br/><strong>Cars</strong><br/>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/97669<br/><strong>Text Mesh</strong><br/>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/84126<br/><strong>Traffic lights</strong><br/>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/61541<br/><strong>Buildings</strong><br/>https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/76766</p>\r\nSprites:\r\n<p>We drew everything ourselves.</p>\r\nMusic:\r\n<p>Menu Music: Funky Suspense<br/>Level 1 Music: Jazz Comedy<br/>Level 2 Music: Jazz Frenzy<br/>Level 3 Music: Extreme Action<br/>All music from https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music </p>\r\nSound effects:\r\n<p>All sound effects in the game are standard license sounds from https://www.zapsplat.com<br/><strong>THANKS FOR PLAYING!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35c0dba265d7077fc2512473de54c709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["erlingde", "Hallur", "birkiro"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
