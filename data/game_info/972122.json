It marks the day that the dead began coming back from their graves in strange new forms, and the knowledge of where people go when they die was no longer a mystery. Turns out people have become much too complex to send to either just heaven or hell when they die, so it was revealed that you will take a certain \u201cdeath route\u201d depending on how you lived and died.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Miracle Festival celebrates this special day and the beauty of the cycle of life and death. It happens all over the planet but the festival in Mordimane, the planet's densest city, is said to be the grandest of them all.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere it is!!
