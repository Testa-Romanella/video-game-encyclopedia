The Game is currently pending review to be published to the Google play store so a webgl version has been placed here in the meantime.</p>\n<p>I made this during Weekly Game Jam 189, to better learn the ways to implement Mobile controls, Unity Ads and try my hand at Google Play Services. I feel like I did a good job with my time over the week and will only go back to this if there is any issues with the project after releasing on the Google Play Store.</p>\n<p>This was also my first attempt at using Unity's Shader Graph and I created my own Water Shader. I felt like this came out nicely and I feel like this has become a good stepping stone towards future shader graph journeys.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:03:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b2/2b2f97e893891bdb919099f43d817829.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AllBentGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
