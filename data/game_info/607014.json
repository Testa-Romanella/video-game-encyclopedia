Even with my horrible writing and spelling. <br/></em></p>\n<p><em>There is a credit scroll in the end of the game to show what music, plugins and tiles I have used, but I will add here that the tiles and sprites as from the wonderful MalibuDarby, and their Horror city sets. And all the different plugins I have used to get this how I want is from VisuStella's MZ plugins. I could not have made anything without any of those. </em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T10:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8b0682dfd18f24879cd93f7e6ea4690.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noinchan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
