We decided to mix a Rogue Like with a Puzzle game.\u00a0 You stroll through a randomly generated cave where in order to progress, you will have to solve a\u00a0grid of Futoshiki (puzzle game similar to the Sudoku) by planting the correct amount of seeds\u00a0in each cell of the grid. Every room has its own grid that you should solve.\u00a0 Completing a room will grant you with some valuable rewards which will come handy when progressing in the cave.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Thank you for playing our game !
