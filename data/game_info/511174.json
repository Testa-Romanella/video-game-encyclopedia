After being built by humans to be used in their wars, the tanks became so advanced and self aware. The tanks begun the construction of other tanks (with help of construction robots of course) to help bolster their strength against the crazy humans that now are after their parts and technology!</p>\n<p>You play as Tech, an old veteran tank that has been in multiple wars. Tech is part of a tank-community and now their community is in danger of crazy humans trying to steal their parts and technology!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>In the current version v0.1.0 there isn't much to do, I've just made a prototype map for the player to move around on.<br/></p>\n<p>In the future\u00a0the player will have a base to defend from\u00a0crazed humans.\u00a0The player can make it easier by\u00a0using traps\u00a0to kill the enemies.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>You can use either Mouse\u00a0&amp; Keyboard or a Gamepad, the game supports both.</p>\r\nMouse\u00a0&amp; Keyboard controls\r\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>MOUSE to aim</li><li>LMB to shoot</li><li>ESC for menu</li></ul>\r\nGamepad controls\r\n<ul><li>LEFT STICK to move</li><li>RIGHT STICK to aim</li><li>R2 to shoot (I don't know XBox button, I don't have that controller)</li><li>OPTIONS/START for menu</li></ul>\r\nRoadmap\r\n<p>I'm a big fan of resource management games. I\u00a0want to incorporate those mechanics somehow into the game. E.g.:\u00a0Mission to claim an iron ore mine to increase your iron ore resources, which can be used for research, traps\u00a0&amp; upgrades.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>Leaving\u00a0feedback is appreciated.
