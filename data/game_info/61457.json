Overburdened with everyday responsibilities, you decide to go live in nature and build your own society. You land on an exotic island without anything other than your <strong>sharp brain</strong>. To make progress in the game, you must use basic materials to build more<strong> complex items</strong> and <strong>workstations</strong>. The end goal of the game is to build a ship which lets you sail off the island to different regions of the world.<br/><br/>Please buy this game only if you want to support development.<br/>The game is in really early access as we want to involve the community in development.<br/>Thanks<br/>- Adriano<br/><br/>Join our Facebook Community<br/>https://www.facebook.com/JourneyOfLifeGame/<br/><br/>Join our Discord Community.<br/>https://discord.gg/ZAzJVzU<br/><br/>Join our Subreddit.<br/>https://www.reddit.com/r/JourneyOfLifeTheGame/<br/><br/>Track our progress on our roadmap.<br/>https://trello.com/b/Iu8L9eX5<br/><br/>Track our last version's work<br/>https://trello.com/b/tbEga4qp/journey-of-life-version-change<br/><br/>Made in Croatia", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55d/55d7c8136b9df0c64381270436726951.jpg", "website": "http://www.hyperion3dstudio.com/journeyoflife.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 47, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 377, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hyperion Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hyperion Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
