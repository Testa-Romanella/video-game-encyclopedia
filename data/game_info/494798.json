This is my first game, it's just a small, four-level arcade game where you dodge other blocks and make it to the finish line. Hoping to release more games after this, so stay tuned! If this gets any donations, I'll make more levels for this and update. At $5, I'll make 10 more levels. At $20, I'll make another 10 levels, along with a settings menu to change difficulty and movement speed. Anyways, hope you have fun, let me know if you'd like any changes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T03:57:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b80/b80a4a21f6a25312d3bea4bccddc968b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SneakiBadger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
