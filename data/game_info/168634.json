Initially we were going to add a dog as a pet. But then Roger from the team decided we all need more dragon in our lives and added a dragon instead. The Dragon can be selected at the bottom of the dropdown list of items you can add to the world. Dragons are not friends with BigHeads, so they will fight each other. BigHeads and Dragons also have HPs now so that they will be removed from the world when their HP reaches 0. Have fun training your dragon!</p>\n<p><strong>-- Overview and Control --</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BEST PLAYED IN FULL SCREEN MODE</strong></p><p><strong>Curious World</strong> is a physics-based sandbox game where you create characters and objects in the world and interact with them.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Character with personalities - outgoing or shy? energetic or lazy?
