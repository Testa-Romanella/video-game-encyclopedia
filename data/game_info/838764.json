Revamped the theme and added an annoying sound effect. This version has some re-balancing and tweaks to help look for fork and checkmate dangers without causing noticeable slow down. Beat version 1.1 in two out of two games so seems stronger.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Quick_Chessyness 1.1 released (16/08/2022)<br/>This feels like a breakthrough. I made the first version hours ago as a faster spin off to Chessyness as that was taking some time thinking of moves. This new version not only effortlessly defeated Chessyness 2 out of 2 (whilst being much snappier) but also checkmated Pico Checkmate. That was a tense match till the end so more testing is needed to see which is the strongest, but as Pico Checkmate takes about three times as long as Quick_Chessyness to think of moves, this engine seems to be on the right track.<br/><br/>Just need to design some prettier chess pieces for it.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Quick_Chessyness 1.0 released (15/08/2022)<br/>I release this the same day as version 1.5 of my pico 8 chess engine Chessyness https://adam-howell.itch.io/chessyness. This has a bunch of tweaks and changes to make it as fast as realistically possible at the expense of the quality of its moves. Also has its own theme to make it more distinct.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Pico 8 isn't fast and it was a bit of a pain developing a chess engine, as testing out each change and benchmarking it could take quite a long time. This faster engine is a bit funner to work with and, despite it's relative easiness, it's fun to play<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T23:21:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1c/e1c2529ac2140f9b4f9aa2460fdba4ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Adam Howell"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
