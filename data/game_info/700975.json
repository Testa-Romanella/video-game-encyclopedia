I love it and still play it to this day.\u00a0 As a game dev I just wanted to capture some of that magic into a 2d experience. This game has different mini games than Wii Sports Resort. This is a 2d game, but still fun to play. This project was just for fun and I am happy with it. I hope you enjoy!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:43:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e036d36f14ef71f1f321d0251af6481.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stopshut"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
