Overscoped!</p><p>This is my entry for Juice Jam II. I\u00a0couldn't finish everything I wanted in time so I figured I'd at least publish the current state and let everyone play to at least take a look.</p>\r\nControls:\u00a0<ul><li><strong>WASD or ArrowKeys\u00a0</strong>- Move</li><li><strong>SpaceBar or Click </strong>- Attack</li><li><strong>SpaceBar </strong>- Confirm on Menus</li></ul><p>This game has <strong>untested </strong>controller support! Use it at your own risk haha</p>What is this Game About?<ul><li>Mr. Bones is fighting zombies in Metropolis!</li><li>Fight enemies, gather their limbs, and decide if you're going to use them for your own or trade them with the Death Queen!</li><li>It's a classic beat 'em up.</li><li>When you trade limbs with the Death Queen, remember that if you're currently equipping them, you're gonna lose them in game! This affects your combat prowess.</li><li>I made everything on my own (solo). Except for this font:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/venice-classic.font\u00a0(credits to\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/soixantedeux.d1425)</li></ul>How does it fit\u00a0the Theme?<p><strong>Theme: Paying the Price</strong></p><ul><li>Mr Bones\u00a0is being tormented by the Death Queen, who requires payment in flesh and bones every once in a while.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul><p>-\u00a0Known Issues:</p><ul><li>You can wander off to the void because the game doesn't prevent you from walking off-screen</li><li>Sometimes the character doesn't respawn correctly after game over.</li><li>Currently, having no legs is not detrimental to the character (was supposed to slow it down)</li><li>There is only one droppable limb (I ran out of time)</li><li>The game is not thoroughly balanced (for the same reasons)</li><li>There is only one sound effect (haha).</li><li>I couldn't get off Mr.\u00a0 Bones' Wild Ride.</li></ul>Final Thoughts<p>As always, I've learned a lot developing this game, and though it's not in the state I\u00a0want, the idea sounds pretty fun. Game jams really do a number on you if you overscope, haha!</p><p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T19:40:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b9/5b945d7f69216e13b953438603f1807f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thinker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
