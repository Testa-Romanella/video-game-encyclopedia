A four player top down eat-em-up game. Eat the most unhealthy foods and make sure that you avoid the pesky 'healthy' foods. There are three superfoods found across the map: burn your enemies like in Vietnam with chilli breath, gas your enemies like Hitler did with a can o' beans, and get high on sugar with the literal sugar bag.<br/><br/>DISCLAIMER: We are sorry if we have offended anyone.
