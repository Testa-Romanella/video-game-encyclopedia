You can explore many lands, collect weapons, and battle to your heart's content! The novel combo mechanism allows you to perform a portion of the combo move with each letter of the word.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The current demo is a simple side scrolling, platformer, arena fighter. This functionality will serve as the battle sequence for the main game upon its release. The rest of the game will be a top-down adventure RPG.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>What to expect? Dev here - This is a solo project at the moment. I have a lot of work to do building the world for the RPG, but I wanted to get this demo out to get some hype for the main game. I intend to update the demo fairly regularly as I add more weapons and monsters to the game so that they can be battle tested as I develop the world to explore. If you find any glitches, be sure to post them in the thread below. There is a separate thread for sharing any uploaded gameplay. I definitely want to see how people react and how I can make the game better!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T05:42:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddbb0a25e0bc60929bd110e2dd75a83d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JonoExplainsThings"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
