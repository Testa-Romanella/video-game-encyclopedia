I'd love your feedback on this platform shooter.</p>\n<p>You can use a sword to pick up crates and throw them to solve puzzles. <br/>And you have a pistol and a rocket launcher. There are nine levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What you can do:</strong></p>\n<p>Fire a few bullets to stun an enemy, then close in and stab them to death with your sword. <br/>Fire a rocket from a distance and blow an enemy off a ledge. <br/>Deftly jump from a wall to a collapsing pile of crates to another wall, then drop down in a surprise attack. <br/>Use your sword to throw a crate onto a button to release some more crates that will form a platform over which to slide another crate to another button. <br/>Blow a door with a perfectly judged throw of a time bomb. <br/>Use a portable turret to draw fire and then sneak round the back and clean up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Level editor:</strong></p>\n<p>Leave comments below if you want to create some new levels or tweak the current levels with you new ideas.</p>\n<p>I will share the online level editor link later on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Check out other\u00a0games and source code that are ON SALE!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/s/64887/lunar-new-year-2022\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T07:57:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7be/7be5fb6bdb918e61d7fac9cd48bae114.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arcade Game Studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
