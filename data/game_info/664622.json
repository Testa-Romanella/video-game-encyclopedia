I made it out of a pure love for the first game, and\u00a0I have to say I'm pretty proud of myself for even pulling this together.\u00a0<br/><br/>This was made with my knowledge of the first release of Khemia and the original game.\u00a0I haven't yet played any other content related to Adastra, so there may be some canonical inconsistencies.<br/></p><p>Every asset and piece of art\u00a0in this project has been taken from the original game, aside from minor edits I have made.
