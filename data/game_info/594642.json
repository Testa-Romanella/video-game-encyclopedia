Its a wave shooter and you have to shoot all the robots. Each round the number of robots increase. As you go, you can collect scraps that the robots drop\u00a0and use them to\u00a0buy new weapons. There is also a shooting range for you to test the weapons out before playing the survival level. Right now there is only one survival level. I plan on working on this some more and after\u00a0more has been added I will update this page.</p>\n<p>There is a windows version and Quest version so if you want to sideload it onto the quest you can, I haven't tested it with any other headsets. It works on the\u00a0quest 1 and 2, I'm sure it will also work on the rift but I haven't tested it.</p>\n<p>Also I'm not sure why but right now the menu in the shooting range doesn't work. I'm going to fix that once I find out why, for now you will have to close the game then come back in to leave the shooting range.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ol><li>To walk use the left controller analog stick</li><li>Rotate around using the right controller analog stick</li><li>Opening the menu, push the menu button on the left controller</li><li>To grab use the grab buttons</li><li>To shoot use the trigger buttons</li><li>To select the menu items press A</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T10:18:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ff/3ff9444b02b2cfd6a5830c22cc8417fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Joshua"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
