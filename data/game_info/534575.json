I didn't get to spend as much time as I had wanted to, but I was still able to roll out the basics and get it to a functional state.</p>\n<p>You play as a delivery person on \"ice\". You must deliver one gift to each person in town, but as mentioned, on \"ice\". Beware, you are being timed as per company rules, you will be penalized for your slow delivery skills!

Throw presents into peoples yards, but be careful, there was no error correction so if you try to give someone a second gift or you miss a yard, the gift will be stuck there and a new one will not spawn resulting you to Alt+F4. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T04:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/3991870be76760a61560be711fef8bea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tusky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
