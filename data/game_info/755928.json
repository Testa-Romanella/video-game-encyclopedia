{"id": 755928, "slug": "omaku", "name": "Omaku", "name_original": "Omaku", "description": "-introduction-\r\n<p>Omaku is a top down action adventure game, where you explore a huge interconnected world, without any hints or hand holding. Everything is cryptic and the game is quite challenging, so prepare to feel lost and frustrated. But if\u00a0 you persevere, you may find something beautiful in it.</p>\n\n\r\n-combat-\r\n<p>You only have one button for attacking and interacting besides directional movement. You can attack while moving by keeping the button pressed or attack standing still by tapping the button. You can also use the environment to your advantage, by cutting down trees that fall on enemies,\u00a0 launching bushes and more.\u00a0While the combat looks simple, right spacing and quick rotation is required. Don't let the cute appearance of the game fool you, it is quite challenging.</p>\n\n\n\r\n-upgrades and collectables-\r\n<p>There are two types of resources in the game : \"moontears\", that are scattered around the world which are required to unlock doors, and \"enemies souls\" (*cough cough* Dark Souls ripoff)\u00a0which can be used on sanctuaries for upgrading your sword size, movement speed or health. Also there are some secret smithing stations in the world, which can give you more abilities.</p>\n\n\n\r\n-campfires-\r\n<p>Campfires are the \"checkpoint\" of the world where you\u00a0can restore your health by resting on them,\u00a0 but the enemies also respawn\u00a0 (*cough cough* Dark Souls ripoff again).\u00a0 When you die you respawn on the latest campfire rested or passed closed by and\u00a0you loose half of your \"souls\" ( I made this game before Sekiro came out so take that FromSoftware! That was original!),\u00a0 but you can go and get them back by killing your \"echo\" at the point of your death.</p>\n\n\r\n-story-\r\n<p>One of the two great lights of the sky, the \"sun\" is gone. Now everyone is lost without her guidance and the world is filled with sorrow. But some lights, while quite dim and small,\u00a0 can radiate hope again.\u00a0The game is quite cryptic. So you have to gather pieces of information and figure out what happened by yourself.</p>\n\n\r\n-state of the game-\r\n<p>Be warned that this game is not finished and you will not find a climatic ending in it. Still the game is pretty large and it can offer up to 3-4 hours of gameplay. Feeling up the \"Lost Souls\" compendium and finding all the \"moontears\" could take many more. I made this game 4 years ago and worked on it for more than a year. I can't promise you that it will be finished but I would love to find out if people would be interested in it.\u00a0</p>\n\r\n-controls-\r\n\n<p>Move Around with WASD or Keys</p>\n<p>Attack/Interact with SPACE or LMB</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0- press B on keyboard or Select on controller to open Compendium\u00a0-</p>\n\n<p><strong>A controller offers the best experience but mouse and keyboard are fine.</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Personal Note :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I started making this game I believe back in 2018-2019. I worked on it for one and a half year, but as I usually do I\u00a0got tired of it and let it get dust on the shelves of my hard drive. All these years making games I don't care about selling them or trying to do all the marketing stuff, I\u00a0just enjoy designing games.\u00a0\u00a0But as the years passed and\u00a0 got detached from this project, as I\u00a0revisited it I felt like\u00a0 it deserves to be out there as a real game, even if I see many flaws in it or even if it is unfinished. I will not promote it or anything, I will just upload it here and let it die in public. But even if one person finds it and get's something out of it, that's more than enough ^^ Also why I decided to put a cost on it? I am not sure... Until now all my projects are free, I have very high standard of what a game should be.\u00a0I do not expect to get any money from it, I just feel like this game even in it's current state, offers many hours of gameplay and must have taken more than a thousand hours to make it. So I think it deserves even a small price, doesn't it?\u00a0^^</p>\n\n<p>Everything in this game was made by me except the music and sfx which are bought assets from the store or cc0 music from sites such as freesound and opengameart. I am pretty sure I used only copyrighted materials but if a non copyrighted sfx or music slipped in the game, let me know and I will remove it immediately. Managing a library of music and sound effects can be a nightmare. Thank you so much to everyone who is creating music and sfx for creators. You are a life saver &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T09:22:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bf/8bf392f51a13bc4ace5d203afeb5bc16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rico"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
