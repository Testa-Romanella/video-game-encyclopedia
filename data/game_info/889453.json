Can you justify all your actions in the past? I think this game is one of the hardest... You don't have to play it... But, if you want, here's the controls: the right/left and down/up arrows will serve as excellent motion generators for your soul. Don't forget that you can climb walls.

Thank you in advance for reading this and noticing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T18:41:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a78d5aa984f41a9ae657b62e69e2da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XYUZ"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
