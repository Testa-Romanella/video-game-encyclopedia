We became friends. When we left the place where we both worked, we kept in contact. Since he lives so far away from me, it's been difficult to see much of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A week ago he asked me if he could borrow a Raspberry Pi, so that he could turn it into a games console of sorts for his kids. I\u00a0suggested he borrow my SNES classic mini. We arranged to meet.</p>\n<p>After this conversation I did some research and found that it was possible to install and run Gameboy games on a jailbroken SNES classic mini. I had been toying with GB Studio, so I decided to make a game and secretly put it on the console for him to discover.</p>\n<p>It took a bit of work, but in the end this game that you see in front of you is working on the console. I wonder if he'll see it and like it. I\u00a0guess you can say it has been <strong>a labour of love</strong> to produce.</p><p>The code snippet images are generated using NodeJS, Puppeteer, and Chromium:\u00a0https://github.com/assertchris/game-riaans-review-image-gen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T12:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/910/91026b3509791a8a9f9560d98635a66c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["assertchris"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
