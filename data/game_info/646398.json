Your task is to place them on the seesaw and make sure that it is balanced. A tricky puzzle game for problem solvers of all ages!<br/><br/>The state of the seesaw in the game is illustrated with mathematical expressions. In that way a range of mathematical concepts are visually explained in an accessible manner. By balancing the seesaw, the goal is also to construct valid mathematical equalities. The player can solve puzzles in an experimental manner and there are often several possible solutions.<br/><br/>Additional features<br/>- Five categories with 50 levels<br/>- Randomly generated puzzles<br/>- Collect stars and stickers<br/>- Multi-user support<br/>- No ads or external links<br/><br/>The game is suitable for age 10 and up and contains the following topics:<br/><br/>- Balance, weight, torque<br/>- Equalities<br/>- Less than, more than<br/>- Addition<br/>- Subtraction<br/>- Multiplication<br/>- Division<br/>- Parentheses<br/>- Fractions<br/>- Powers and roots", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T03:19:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd4/dd405cfd3245de1a38c933115c0044f7_bkYA32l.jpg", "website": "http://oddrobo.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Oddrobo Software"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Oddrobo Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
