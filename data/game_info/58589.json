{"id": 58589, "slug": "ascentrl", "name": "AscentRL", "name_original": "AscentRL", "description": "Attempt to navigate your way through 17 floors of this monster infesting, maze of twisting passage and ascend to freedom!<br/><br/>AscentRL is a first-person, 3D roguelike. It is not real-time, but it is also not exactly turn-based. Instead gametime in AscentRL increments only while the player is actively engaged (moving, attacking, waiting, etc). If the player does not provide input, the game waits. This allows the player to consider situations and tactics while attempting to maintain the feel of an action-packed first person style rpg.<br/>AscentRL features 17 floors of procedurally-generated dungeons populated by a vast horde of undead. Along the way, you'll discover attack and defense upgrades to assist you in your quest. Similarly, at each floor ascended, you'll be granted some additional health and endurance.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0e9/0e9c1f81f7235f87dd994132dd325d20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
