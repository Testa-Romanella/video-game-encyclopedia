{"id": 46184, "slug": "stone-story-rpg", "name": "Stone Story RPG", "name_original": "Stone Story RPG", "description": "In a realm of perpetual evil, a single stone could change everything.<br/><br/><strong>Stone Story</strong> is an RPG set in a dark and vile world. The game's fluid ascii art is painstakingly animated in plain text by a single insane game developer. The game has been in development since 2014 and is presently in closed beta testing. It features 8 locations to explore, 8 boss fights, mind-blowing ascii cutscenes and plenty of loot to discover.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The casual play contrasts with the retro visuals, providing a <strong>unique experience</strong> that blends nostalgia with modern design principles. One of the game's defining mechanics is that you have no direct control of the player character. You choose what items to equip, which location to visit and relax while an artificial intelligence does all the exploring, combat and looting. That doesn't mean this is an idle game. Potions and special abilities are maximized by good timing. Boss fights are intense and can keep you at the edge of your seat, requiring quick item swaps if the boss changes patterns. Additionally, an item crafting system allows you to combine otherwise disposable items--rewarding experimentation, giving you interesting choices and making full use of all the gathered loot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Initial language support is English, Portuguese and Chinese. Further localization will be added based on regional demand.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T21:33:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/348/348cb0a692785de86d71fa0fd45bfdfb.jpg", "website": "http://StoneStoryRPG.com", "rating": 4.09, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 35, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["iOS", "Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Martian Rex"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Martian Rex"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
