You play in a fictional part of Kansas as a red-shirted, blank slate of a young man named Greg who looses his brother in 1998 after he goes on a 'Vision Quest', a native american legend and a variation of the name 'Spirit Walk'. Shortly after his disappearance, an anomalous virus starts turning the majority of the city into zombie-like-beings. The ultimate goal is to find your brother in the year 2002, where the government has isolated and erased the city from the rest of the world and the populous of the city have all gone\u00a0<em>almost</em>\u00a0completely insane. Along the way, you'll have all sorts of wacky misadventures ranging from goofy to completely messed up. Who knows, you might meet some interesting characters along the way. Can you find your brother before your sanity snaps like a fucking twig?</p>\n\n<p>Gamejolt Page</p>\n<p>Skull Krackers on Youtube</p>\n<p>Skull Krackers on Soundcloud</p>\n<p>Skull Krackers on Discord\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Tumblr<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e10c682d80c290105f12b3ff1639b91b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skull Kracker Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
