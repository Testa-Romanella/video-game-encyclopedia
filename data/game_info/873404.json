You can\u00a0<strong>play the available prototype</strong>! (But i<em>t's all in french for now!</em>).</p>\n<p>--------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>THE GAME :</strong></p>\n<p>Hexactical is a pure <strong>tactical game with some mechanics of deck-building</strong>. We are creating it as the curious child of <em>Into The Breach</em> and <em>Slay The Spire</em> (two excellent games).</p>\n<p>In this game, you can't damage your enemies directly, you need to make them kill each other! To achieve that, you can use cards that will permit you to move or rotate the entities on the map.</p>\n<p>It's planned to be rogue-like at the end!</p>\n<p>--------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS :</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse only (for now!)</li></ul>\n<p>--------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>STATUS :</strong></p>\n<p>This page will be updated gradually as the game became more and more complete.<br/></p>\n<p>It's planned to be a commercial game one day, but you can join us on\u00a0Snappy Sloth's discord to share your feedbacks and questions or just chatting with us!</p>\n<p>By the way, you can follow its development on the Tipyx's stream on\u00a0Twitch (\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 french stream!
