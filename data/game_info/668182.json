Making<em>\u00a0appropriate </em>sounds for the Gameboy is a chore and I already reached my personal deadline.</p>\n<p>Play it on Gameboy Color for better performance.</p>\n<p>Originally this game was planned as a RPG-Shooter, which is in my opinion an underdeveloped genre, but this project took waaaaay more time than it should. The Gameboy has it quirks and I made many, many mistakes along the way, but I learned a LOT during development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Prior to making this game I didn\u00b4t have any knowledge about C. I want to encourage everyone to try the ZGB Engine. Zalo, the creator of ZGB, wrote a great tutorial how to use the engine. I used any piece of code I could find to get familiar with the engine. So copy as much as you can in the beginning. It will take a while (especially understanding pointers and structs), but your results will be awesome. Don\u00b4t be afraid of coding. The code for this game was written in Notepad++. ZGB is a great engine and Zalo updated it recently. Give it a chance! I hope you had fun playing my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T05:22:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16f3811765707179c1230cab127a0cd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["freshdeus"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
