I do.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo I designed this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVR should not only mean to be a simulator of the things we know because the real world sucks.<br/>\r\nVR should be able to bring virtual concepts and imaginations closer to the reality.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAct like Himura Kenshin, Ukyo Tachibana, Agatsuma Zenitsu or Vergil here.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe katana in your hand is your only weapon in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou need to read the attacks of various enemies and block them to build advantages.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRemember your attack is decisively powerful at the moment your katana leaves its holster. You can cut the enemy in half, or burst the time dilation and cut it into pieces, and of course, you can tear everything apart in the dedicatedly sheathing moment with bonuses from accuracy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDance with your enemies as they move, try to beat you up wielding numerous weapons. They will even try to knock you back or finish it with a levitation batter!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T04:10:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/8890a21bb382fa31f87bdd4a655a025c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Archetype Edge"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Archetype Edge"], "esrb_rating": null}
