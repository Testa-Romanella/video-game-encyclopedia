In the story, the old man takes the glove back, but we imagine a story where the animals can live safely in the magical home. They are lost and <strong>we have to lead them</strong> to it <strong>by a fox from the Ukrainian story</strong>, and <strong>Wawel Dragon from Polish legends</strong>, to <strong>unify our nations</strong> by social cooperation, and unfold/<strong>bring safe future for everyone (including forest beings</strong> that also need peace to exist).</p>\n\n<p><strong>We developed the first level,</strong> in which you lead a little mouse to magical rukavychka.</p>\n<p>We were inspired by <strong>traditional floral patterns</strong> for the backgrounds (made by watercolors and ink). We also focused on <strong>colors from Ukrainian flag</strong> (yellow and blue shades, with a bit of green for the leaves) and <strong>important Ukrainian flowers like sunflower</strong> or Vinca species.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>MADE BY:</strong><br/><br/>Agata Nawrot and Sebastian Krzyszkowiak\u00a0for <em>United with Ukraine Game Jam 2022.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Source code available on GitLab.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T18:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/133/1335e3e7a2af04d4bbf9c019d9d18a7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Holy Pangolin"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
