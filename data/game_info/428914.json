Always be on the edge - for nobody yet has managed to escape from this place.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500<br/><br/>A mostly single-handled love letter to indipendent horror games, this title aims to satisfy any true fan of the genre. Exploration will reward the player, items and puzzles will tease your brain, and in the midst of all this a danger might strike from right around the next corner.
