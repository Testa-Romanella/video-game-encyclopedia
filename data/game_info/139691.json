One day... one fateful day, they created a \"polygon\" of sorts, and it chose to exact revenge on those scientists trying to kill it!</p>\n<p>This is a simple, minimalist 2D platformer I created. It's mostly just a prototype and not supposed to be anything special. I haven't touched it in a while and just decided that I'll upload it as it is. There are 15 levels and you want to try and get the best time you can on each level. You can probably finish the whole thing in under 10 minutes. Each level should take anywhere from 10-40 seconds. <br/></p>\n<p>Have fun and enjoy it. It's not a super serious game, and I'd honestly suggest you just mute the noise from the menu and listen to your own music. <br/></p><p>Made with Unity 3D.<br/></p>\n<p>Let me know what you think of it. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7d/b7dec92d0ec3dec298bf39709477d4d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mars On Fire"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
