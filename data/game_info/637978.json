Mostly made as an experiment and to prove I could actually make a game. I'm not a sprite artist so the (incomplete) assets for the main character are about as far as I got before motivation ran out, the sprites for all the enemies are placeholder squares. But in terms of Gameplay Mechanics it's everything I wanted to achieve. Any further work that would need to be done would require skills I do not have and have no interest in developing (sprite art, music and sfx, cutscenes ect). If I ever kidnap a sprite artist or get possessed one day I'll likely fully \"finish\" the game with all intended visuals. For now I'm happy with what I did, if you look past the visuals and ignore the complete silence.</p>\n\n<p>Gamepad recommended for best play experience. F1 changes between windowed and fullscreen mode.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T05:15:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bf/9bf300b1fdd7e934957ac585bd2d6a5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["randomfox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
