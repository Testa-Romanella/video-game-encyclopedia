From this, we focused on the theme of Ragnar\u00f6k which is a Norse Myth Event where the world ends. In initial drafts, we wanted to create separate maps and different enemies but due to time constraints, it is impossible for such as feat so a minimalized and working game was created as a result to hand in.</p><p>ADDITIONAL NOTE: Credits to the other contributors to this project are found in the Ludem Dare post where it shows all the authors of this page.\u00a0I wish not to take the majority of the credit for this game and this publish is merely served as a port to allow you all to test and help us improve our game creating learning.</p>\n<p>This game, is a top-down shooter where the player fights it way around the map to collect weapon power-ups and defeat enemies. Only lose condition is when the player dies from enemies OR the time runs out does the end credits roll.\u00a0As a personal contributor along with fellow contributors, it is still a WIP but a playable game.</p>\n<p>I wish to see your feedback on how to improve this game and please do not hesitate to contact us for any queries or advice on how to complete our learning.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T22:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/196372fb7bf35a2a717ae74ae0f53893.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hylin Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
