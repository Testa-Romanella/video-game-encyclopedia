Try to balance out the barge while propelling the boat forward and not losing all the wool.</p>\n<p>The concept for this game came about because the theme of the game jam was Yorkshire #YorkshireJam.</p>\n<p>When I think of the things I'm impressed of by\u00a0Yorkshire, the historic buildings and mills come quite high up. The biggest mill steeped in history would be Salt's mill.<br/></p>\n<p>Sir Titus Salt mill owner not only built the mill but the whole village of Saltaire to house his workers in good living conditions, and he was pretty eccentric using alpaca wool to make his fortune.
