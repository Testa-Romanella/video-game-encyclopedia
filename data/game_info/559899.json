Respect their cocktail order by pouring the correct drinks in the correct order into their glass. Add poison without being seen\u00a0to get closer to your goal of sinking your rivals business! In order for a customer to be poisoned by a cocktail, you have to serve the right order, otherwise they won't drink it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each day, earn enough money to keep your job and your boss's doubts low, but don't forget to poison enough drinks to lower the customer pool and the bar reputation. You don't want to help your rivals, do you?</p>\n\n<p>This is a demo.
