When it is \u201c0\u201d you can reach the goal; otherwise, you must lose the tails first.\u00a0 Reaching the goal faster results in a bonus applied to the score. The bonus is up to 2x the goal score and diminishes down to zero when the bonus timer expires.\u00a0 The current bonus timer is shown in the HUD in the top left corner.\u00a0 Your distance to the next checkpoint is noted right below the cop counter in the top right corner.\u00a0 Each successive checkpoint increases your score noted in the top left.\u00a0 Try to get a new high score in each play through!\r\n</p>\n<p>Police do not immediately chase you.\u00a0 If they see you commit a traffic crime such as running a red light, excessive speeding over the 35 mph speed limit, or hitting another vehicle then they will begin the chase.\u00a0 If you are under a chase, then each additional cop that sees you will give chase as well.\r\n</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The game plays best with an Xbox controller attached to Windows.\u00a0 You can play with mouse and keyboard but the driving controls are a bit stiffer and the car is harder to handle (at least at the moment).\u00a0 In general driving games are easier played with a controller as you get more precise movement controls.\r\n</p>\r\nGamepad Controls:\r\n<p>Gas: Right Trigger\r\n</p>\n<p>Brake: Left Trigger\r\n</p>\n<p>Handbrake: \"A\" / Down face button\r\n</p>\n<p>Steering: Left thumbstick\r\n</p>\n<p>Rotate camera: Right thumbstick\r\n</p>\n<p>Look Behind: Click right thumbstick\r\n</p>\n<p>Re-center camera behind you: Y\u201d / Up face button\r\n</p>\n<p>Horn: Click left thumbstick\r\n</p>\n<p>Pause Menu: Special left button (the one with the two windows)\r\n</p>\r\nMouse and Keyboard Controls:\r\n<p>Gas: W\r\n</p>\n<p>Brake: S\r\n</p>\n<p>Handbrake: Spacebar\r\n</p>\n<p>Steering: A/D\r\n</p>\n<p>Rotate camera: Mouse\r\n</p>\n<p>Look Behind: Mouse right click\r\n</p>\n<p>Re-center camera behind you: Mouse left click\r\n</p>\n<p>Horn: H\r\n</p>\n<p>Pause Menu:\u00a0 Esc, P <br/></p>\r\n Credits \r\n<p><strong>Design and Programming:</strong> Justin Montgomery</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong> Greg Corcoran</p>\n<p><strong>Voice Acting:</strong> Corey Collier</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects: </strong>FreeSound.org</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Effects:</strong> Unreal Marketplace Assets\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong> Unreal Marketplace Assets, Medel Academy</p>\n<p><strong>UI:</strong> Google fonts, game-icons.net</p>\n<p>Made with Unreal Engine.</p>\r\n News and Updates\r\n<p>Subscribe to our mailing list!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T17:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ed/5ed58bcafd5177beb857821f17c797dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameSalutes"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
