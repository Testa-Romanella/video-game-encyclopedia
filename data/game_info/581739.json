A perfect place to lure new victims to for your newly founded Murder Club. All you have to do is click - click - click...\r\nBut what to do with the bodies? And their souls, they also seem to linger...\r\nPerhaps there are more dark forces that could use some idle assistance?\r\n\r\nThis game is fully mouse-controlled. The game saves automatically, and idle progress is maintained between sessions. A \"give it to me now\" cheat exists, speeding up time x50, but is only available on request - or you could find it yourself.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:37:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08b/08b69d50348e89a3953796ebab63b751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["weckar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
