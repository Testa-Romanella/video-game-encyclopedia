Large blob-particles can convert smaller blob-particles of the opposing color, and the top left and right corners show how much of the total goo is taken up by each color. The game ends when one color has obtained all of the goo, but whether that outcome is good or bad is up to the players to decide amongst themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Players use WASD, IJKL, the arrow keys and Numpad 8456 to move around, respectively.
