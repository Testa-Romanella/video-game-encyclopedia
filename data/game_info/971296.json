Orlando will be continuously raised by the ladder between the buildings and you must click anywhere on the screen to switch the building he is facing. Choose the windows with the victims and avoid the burning ones until the water is ready.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Do your best until your colleague Bernardo prepare the water hose. Smash the water button to maximize the rescues and put out the fire. On watering mode the ladder speed raises and Orlando can face any window and score with it all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game art style is heavily inspired by our favorite video game hero from the 80s. A modern homage with a twist.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T12:36:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9aa/9aaac39b13c11cf1996ce7d9f888e889.jpg", "website": "https://www.indigoware.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndigoWare"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IndigoWare"], "esrb_rating": null}
