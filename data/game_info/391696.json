Should become obvious when the situation presents itself so hopefully you enjoy it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T02:41:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b1558f524838eb4b179deacc987aca27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pumpycola"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
