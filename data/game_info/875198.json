Use your unusually long limbs to climb to an unusually high peak, in H8 2:\u00a0Carry Flag! (nb:\u00a0h8 is intended to be pronounced as\u00a0\"H<em>eight</em>\", due to the umlaut)</p><p><strong>New in v1.1:\u00a0A map screen in the game!</strong></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WSAD : move current thing (see top right corner)</li><li>Q E : <em>select</em> <em>&amp;</em>\u00a0<em>latch </em>left and right arm</li><li>Z C : <em>select </em>&amp;\u00a0<em>latch </em>left and right foot</li><li>X : select body (when limb is valid)</li><li>2 : cancel current limb movement</li><li>4 : Show a cool map to help you find where to go, or see how high you are</li></ul><p>(Controls will vary if you use the onscreen keypad)</p>\n<p><strong>Goal: </strong>Reach the top of the mountain. It's just over 120 height units high. <strong>There is an ending</strong>. There is no timer or points.\u00a0</p><p>If you would like to see the ending again, but hate climbing, you can watch here it in gif format:\u00a0https://github.com/Chromatophore/h8-2-Carry-Flag#goal<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rules:</strong> You <strong>CAN </strong>latch <strong>both your hands</strong>, or <strong>both your feet</strong>, to the same node. But you <strong>CAN NOT</strong> latch a\u00a0hand on to the same node as a foot, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>You can only extend your limbs so far. There is an i<strong>ndicator on your chest</strong> that shows roughly how much more extension you can achieve.</p>\n<p><strong>Help!\u00a0</strong>If you scroll your current latch point off the screen and get stuck, use the 'cancel current limb movement' button to put it back where it was,\u00a0and adjust your body.</p>\n<p>If you can't work out where to go, or want to know how far up you are, there is a 'height_map.png' file available, which is an image file showing where all the nodes are on the cliff face.</p>\n<p><strong>Also:\u00a0</strong>If you leave the game running and look at a different tab, the frame rate limiter <em>may </em>not function correctly, resulting in the game running very fast. If you leave it for a long time, eventually it will catch back up and play normally again.</p>\n<p><strong>Other: </strong>This is a spiritual?\u00a0sequel to h8, a mountaineering simulator game for Octojam IV. It was a collaboration project between myself (aka Mastigophoran)\u00a0and Taqueso. Unfortunately, I was too busy with work\u00a0that really I only was able to offer the initial idea, and helped a little with the drawing loops. The rest of that project was all Taqueso's work, and I fondly remember the many wonderful ideas he\u00a0implemented, as well as those that fell on the cutting room floor. I decided perhaps a sequel would be a good project to do for Octojam 9, and\u00a0go from Superchip up to\u00a0XO-Chip, and try to implement some of the ideas we'd had in our heads when we butted up against the realities of Superchip.</p><p>This project is on git hub, and can be found here:\u00a0https://github.com/Chromatophore/h8-2-Carry-Flag</p>\n<p>You can play the original h8 here:\u00a0https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/index.html?gist=350a47c19c055f8e508c4cc573e71...\u00a0And it's source is available here:\u00a0https://github.com/jdeeny/h8-octojam2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T10:57:55", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chromatophore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
