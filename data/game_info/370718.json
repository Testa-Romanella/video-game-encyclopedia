{"id": 370718, "slug": "going-deeper", "name": "Going Deeper", "name_original": "Going Deeper", "description": "<p>Going Deeper began as a passion project back in 2006. After an incident during a service trip in Peru in which Weston was attacked by a small Andean mountain cat, he became momentarily paralyzed and thus spent 2 months in a small shack ruminating over the true meaning of life. The project began in Natalia\u2019s garage, but after 3 years of scrounging to make ends meet, we upgraded to a slightly larger garage. Our journey was not without difficulties and setbacks; upon beta testing of the game, Laura\u2019s mother fell extremely ill due to the cats released around the house, and unfortunately passed away. Thousands of hours and millions of dollars down the drain, we couldn\u2019t be happier to present you with our game. Please consider donating to our Patreon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T06:48:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3e/f3eb6393010df0f9045ce5a20a110c01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WestonBDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
