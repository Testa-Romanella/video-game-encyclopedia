The sprite assets are found from\u00a0Open Game Art.</p>\n<p>Audio credits are put in the Feature Doc that comes with the game download, I do notice that there are a looooot of FELT songs in there.</p>\n<p>It is advised to turn down your audio a little before hitting the Play button, it might be loud and there is no in-game volume slider. Otherwise, enjoy the circle music while playing!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Move:\u00a0WASD / Arrow Keys /\u00a0Numpad Keys</li><li>Shoot: Hold Space</li><li>Exit Game: Alt + F4 / Close Window\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>P.S. Why is this called Shmup? I always misspell it as \"Shump\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T08:02:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/212a314a514a4ed4e2dc93cb66c1eadd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hayaka Sae"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
