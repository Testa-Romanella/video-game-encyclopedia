He's done a lot for me over the years and I want to bring him some sort of local co-op retro action that is different everytime. So hopefully he doesn't work out I'm making this for him.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBlitz Smash is a run and gun rogue built around the idea of setting up action paced gameplay. Enemies, weapon upgrades and items are placed into the level to create a balance between action and suspense.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game is designed to be for nights in with 1-4 mates with a dirty pizza and a few beers and just blitzing levels.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI hope you enjoy and I hope my brother is happily surprised.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Edit: He was :D, watch his reaction here</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>-Matt</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWebsite: http://www.blitzsmash.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTwitter: https://twitter.com/BlitzSmash\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBug List\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFAQ\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFeedback/Suggestions\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEvery coin we make will go back into the development of this game :)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Update:</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tversion 0.4:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the final free version release of this game.
