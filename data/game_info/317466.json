It consists of a group of mice that are trying to escape the prison that they are in. By spawning in more mice, the player will have to navigate all of them to the keys located all around the levels. The player must also align all the mice onto the keys at the same time. Any misalignment can cost the player their freedom.</p>\n<p>This is a game that is made to make the player interact with their environment. Only by using pushing against objects and aligning themselves, can they achieve freedom from their captors. The players must also watch out for the guards which can send the player back to their start position. A puzzle game that is reliant on the player mastering their environment.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys or WASD for movement</li><li>Space bar to spawn in a new character</li></ul>\n<p>Credit to Prodigious Creations for the Decrepit Dungeon LITE asset and also to Dungeon Mason for the Mouse Knight PBR Polyart asset</p>\n<p>Links to both are here:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/decrepit-dungeon-lite-33936<br/></p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mouse-knight-pbr-polyart-135227<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:02:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89d/89da379199c75d2f719bb975282dc1ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["rcs.12000"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
