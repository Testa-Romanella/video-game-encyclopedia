Also please remember that not all Indie games can afford to create their own assets, we did purchase the majority of ours from Unity Asset Store and gave credit to those artists.<br/><br/>3 of us started out on a website called Indieteamup, from 3 different countries. We picked an engine, Unity, a framework, Adventure Creator, and I had the idea for the game. 2 Months later we had a complete game, just needed the set dressing and texturing for release, then along comes the Vive, 2 of us decide to convert it to VR, and here we are. Please enjoy!<br/><br/>This was a non-VR game we developed that we converted to VR, so please be patient as we change everything for room space play!<br/>This is mainly an exploration game with a few minor puzzles and some treasure to collect. Please enjoy! <br/>(This is not in any way meant to be historically accurate so there will be a mix of hieroglyphics and 'god' images unrelated or completely out of context).<br/>The final release we might package the PC version with it as well, until then if interested in the PC demo please see our gamejolt page.<br/><br/><br/>brought to you by...<br/><br/><strong>Notso Entertaining Productions:</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f0/4f0be3cdab5a6bb3d0b6ba2e13ca2af3.jpg", "website": "http://www.notso.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Olivier Chrun", "Christopher Meyer", "Alvaro Urrutia Luna"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Notso Entertaining Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
