Feeling under the weather you decide to go for a late walk, objects along the way guide you through your mental journey. These seemingly random thoughts help to keep your sanity and remind you of little things in life. Just like one would go for a midnight walk and endeavor on an inner journey guided by entities encountered along the way.</p><p>The game is short, due to given timeline. So eventually you will not find any new objects and respawn when sanity runs out.</p><p>Authors - Darie Picu and Dalius Grazinskis</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/737/737caadd0b270d4413e5cb8905e345ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dalius Grazinskis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
