The only problem is that your enemies have just arrived as well. Whose strategy will result in the necessary expansion needed to lay claim to the land?</p>\n<p>The <strong>Venture </strong>is on!</p>\n\r\nBuildings\r\n<p>Your strength as a conqueror of Carpathia is expressed through the growth of your individual Villages as well as the territory claimed by them. Finding the balance of Upgrades and Ventures could make or break your campaign.</p>\r\nResources\r\n<p>Resources are at a never before seen abundance. Harvest and use them wisely to your advantage in funding your Venture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Resources are used for building new Venturers and Villages as well as buying Upgrades. Resources can also be traded in the Market.<br/></p>\r\nWeather\r\n<p>Though at first it may seem Carpathia is welcoming with open arms, the harsh weather arrives to make one think otherwise. Wildfires, rainstorms, and droughts will seek to cut off your resource harvests and slow your progress.</p>\n\r\nGuilds\r\n<p>Lay claim to Carpathia in the name of your chosen guild. In future development: guilds will grant certain perks to encourage different play styles and help by giving\u00a0you certain advantages.</p>\n\r\nMagic\r\n<p>Even in these new lands more surprises await.\u00a0Strange and powerful obelisks have begun to appear across the land.\u00a0In future development: more uses for magic such as spell crafting.</p>\n\n<p>Our game is\u00a0being actively developed by a small team and we have put together our first initial build in time for <strong>PAX Online 2020</strong>!
