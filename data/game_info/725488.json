You play as marble on the table, thats it, but this project is using new UE5s technology such as LUMEN (real time reflections and ray tracing, basically simulating real time playable real life like environment) and NANITE (can load most tinyest details without much impact on fps). Now remember this is the future of games, and also not everyone can run this so make sure you have good pc for this. And please tell me what you think of this?</p>\n<p>Inspired by NVIDIAs Marbles at Night\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T11:06:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/1086631223b39117447fb079e89a3007.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelSpeed"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
