Avoid cars, jump on logs, and don\u2019t get eaten.<br/></p>\n<p>In <strong><em>Defrogger</em></strong>, frogs still want to cross the road \u2013 but you won\u2019t let them. Strategically place cars to mow down as many little green jumpy bois as you can.\r\n  </p>\r\n\u00a0Cruel, yes, but a hell of a lot of fun!\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Use the WASD or arrow keys to move around your Cursor.\u00a0When you press SPACE, a car will start driving towards the other side of the screen. Hit frogs to gain points.</p>\n<p>When hitting multiple frogs with a single car, you\u2019ll get more points for every frog you hit!\r\n</p>\n<p>Every time a frog successfully crosses the road, or two of your cars collide, a life will be subtracted. The player starts out with 10 lives, and can gain a new one as a reward for every 10 points they score.\r\n</p>\r\nStatement\r\n<p>I really really enjoyed this a lot. This was my first time making a working demo from scratch, without a tutorial. Because I was fairly busy, I only had three days to actually make the game, but I am very happy with the result. This has showed that with enough motivation, I can turn a game idea into an actual game fairly easily. I have always had ideas for big projects, but never started working on them. This gamejam has inspired me to at least try, and see where it leads me.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thank you so much.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f50bff8984b56eabc5a44e0d6c17ccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David, apparently."], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
