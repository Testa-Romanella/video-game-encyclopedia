The project includes both mountains and a large body of water. The player can access the entire project world in the 1st-person view. The player will spawn among the snowy mountains and can explore the grasslands to his left, the body of water to his north, or the mountains to his south. The project has standard controls (W, A, S, D) for movement. The project world mimics the real world through moving grass and trees. Finally, I hope you enjoy the game.</p>\n<p>(Thanks to Rakshi Games's \"Realistic Tree 9 [Rainbow Tree]\" Asset Package)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T08:54:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b15a2b1dbc70ac754b914ba9ca78842f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SDaverpally"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
