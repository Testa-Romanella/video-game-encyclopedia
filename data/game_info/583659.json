So what I ended up building is a very short experience with one quest and a few enemy types.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before you start exploring, be sure to equip the items in your inventory (I). They will make a world of difference.</p>\n<p>You can navigate via the keypad, press A to attack, S to use the special ability of each character and I to open the inventory.</p>\n<p>I literally didn't even have time to finish the escape/options menu so ALT+F4 is your only way to quit, heh. My save system wasn't ready either when it came down to saving which mobs are dead, so there's no saving either. Luckily, the adventure isn't too long.</p><p>Stuff to note: in the village, you may rest at the tavern (all the way ahead from the entrance) and visit the Lord's manor (turn right at the intersection). This isn't readily apparent and there was no time for me to make this more noticeable.\u00a0</p><p>I will continue to develop this game, as time permits.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T00:06:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/702/70298c8ba05a5a968d43c71187e8f102.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VSI Studio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
