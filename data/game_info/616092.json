Only his 2 first cards are revealed to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first player draws a card that only he looks at and can either:</p>\n<p>A. put it back in the discard pile using the effect of this card (see part: cards' effect).</p>\n<p>B. replace one of his cards and then discard the replaced card.</p>\n<p>The next player has the choice:</p>\n<ul><li>either take the last card from the discard pile to integrate it into his game (see B);</li><li>either to draw a card and perform one of the previous actions (A or B).</li></ul>\r\nQuick discard\r\n<p>When a player discards one of his cards during his turn, any of the other players can put the same card on this discard pile from the cards placed in front of him. If several players have a similar card to put on the discard pile, the fastest wins, the slower one puts his card back in his deck.</p>\n<p>If a player discards the wrong card, he puts his card back in his hand and is penalized by taking the first card from the draw pile without looking at it.</p>\r\nEnd of a round\r\n<p>As the turns progress, the players must lower the value of their hands (cards placed face down in front of them) by replacing or discarding them.<br/></p>\n<p>At any time a player can say the word \"Cactus\", which will automatically end their turn. The other players can then all play a final round. Once the player who announced \"Cactus\" has played the round ends.</p>\n<p>Each player then reveals his cards and adds up his points.</p>\r\nCards' effect\r\n<p>When one of the cards listed below is discarded by a player, he must use its effect:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>7, 8</strong>: Look at one of your cards, then put it back face down in the same place</li><li><strong>9, 10</strong>: Look at one of your opponent's cards, then put it back face down in the same place</li><li><strong>Jacks, Queens</strong>: Blindly exchange one of your cards with that of an opponent.
