Here are the changes and fixes that I made to that source code:</p><p>-Replaced LucasArts logo with a ScummGen logo.</p><p>-Made a few grammar corrections to the original script.</p><p>-Created icons for inventory items that lacked them (all instances of the stones and the gas can).</p><p>-Programmed an if/then statement regarding the gas can that was referenced but not implemented in the source.</p><p>-Fixed the mechanism puzzle to require both objects, as before it was possible to complete it with only one object.</p><p>-Added dialog to facilitate the change in the mechanism puzzle.</p><p>-Fixed the lighting so that the cavern stays lit when you move to the cavern entrance and back.</p><p>-Enabled the usage of the item used to exit the cavern, as referenced but not implemented in the source.</p><p>-Changed the description of the macguffin as it was originally used as a joke related to the game being unfinished (but kept it humourous to suit the tone of the original).</p><p>-Added dialog necessary for the ending sequence.</p><p>-Added an ending screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dac/dac505b8f71d1af28f74d813fbbb7840.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JenniBee"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
