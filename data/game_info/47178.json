Players have the opportunity to unlock or purchase cosmetics items to stand out and be easily recognized by your fans during tournaments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You, the game-player, are witnessing the birth of a revolutionary concept in gaming: True ownership of digital assets. In other words, <strong>everything you own in BtV also exists outside of, and independent from, the game platform. </strong><br/>With traditional game platforms, you leave your winnings and game assets behind the moment you leave the platform. They only exist within that world, and that world can be taken away from you at any time; by a business or technical failure, by a ban. <br/>In contrast, your <strong>blockchain-enabled game assets (e.g., avatars, motherships, skins, chest, ...), are portable. </strong>They exist inside and outside the game platform. You own them and can do what you want with them. You can <strong>buy, sell, and trade them directly with other people</strong>. You can offer them for sale at the shop. <br/><br/>Shop features: <br/><ul><li>A variety of skins, avatars, titles, holotag, event cards and packs are available.</li></ul><ul><li>Your assets are yours. You can buy, sell or trade them on the shop.</li></ul><ul><li>Nexium is an ERC20 token used to buy items in the online shop.</li></ul><ul><li>Nexium token is compatible with MyEtherWallet.</li></ul><ul><li>More free and premium content will be added on a regular basis thanks to the great work of the development team.</li></ul><br/>To support our continuous cycle of play/iterate/improve, use the \u201cReport a bug\u201d button in the game or mention it in the \u201cFeedback\u201d channel on our Discord.
