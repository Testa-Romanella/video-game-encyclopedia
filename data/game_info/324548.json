The challenge being how to create such effect without breaking the users inmersion with desynched hand positions when trying to go through objects in game.</p>\n<p>The body is being\u00a0controlled by Inverse Kinematics (FinalIK)\u00a0using the controllers and headset's positions as the targets for the IK system.</p>\n<p>I give the player's hands physics-like interactions using Unity's physic system to be able to collide with solid object, knock them down, grab them and interact with the world as if you were in real life. You have a pistol and a shotgun as two starting guns you can use since the target is to make a little framework to create VR FPS games in the future.</p>\n<p>This is a work in progress project being developed for university as an experiment. All feedback is wellcome so fell free to comment if you tried it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T04:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc3/cc37b54c9e08e793a5a08fcd4d3c84a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Bruna"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
