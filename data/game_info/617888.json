The goldmine just outside town seems like it should bring great riches to anyone who seeks them, but there is a catch: The mine is haunted, and the spirits that reside there are not happy about people taking their gold. Will you be able to overcome the spirit's reckoning, and more importantly, how much money will you be able to earn while doing so?</p>\n<p>Ghost Rush Railway is a game based on the genre of Tower Defense, but with a twist: Rather than being able to place towers anywhere, they must be joined together to form a train that is capable of moving along its tracks. This mechanic must be used to its fullest to succeed, while also balancing it with the important task of transporting the gold to upgrade your train.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:26:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab9/ab9d411a0a3d3fe727890237bbe5d0e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RedPickxel"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
