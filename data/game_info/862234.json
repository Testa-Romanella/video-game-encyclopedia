After seeing how much y'all loved Fighting Jam, I decided to follow up to that game with a sequel of sorts, featuring 15 playable characters, 6 tracks and many items to spice things up.</p><p>Note: The engine used to make this game is SuperTuxKart. I do not own the engine nor do I own SuperTuxKart in general. This is all for fair use. I also don't own Ryan Louch &amp; Charlie Murdoch from Kingfisher School. Again, this is all for fair use.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T12:28:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d0/9d0b5ba0856757174f1bf29bb320017f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MultiverseRumble"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
