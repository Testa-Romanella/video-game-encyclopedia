Even if you like platformers, it will probably still be very hard.</p>Description<p>You are a samurai on a quest to deliver a sword. Controls will be introduced as you play.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are playing for Ludum Dare judging, then you should rate UPS1.1. Feel free to check out UPS2.0, which is the (likely final) post-jam version, but don't include it in judging. On the other hand, if you are playing for fun, don't even bother looking at the previous versions.</strong><br/></p><p>UPS was made for Ludum Dare 37, whose theme was \"One Room.\" If you play through the whole game, you'll see how we used the theme. ;)</p><p>UPS1.1 was uploaded on Dec 15, a couple of days after the Ludum Dare ended. We made two minor fixes to make things easier: you can now jump out of your aerial attack animation, and we added one more checkpoint. We recommend that you download this version.</p><p>UPDATE: Merry Christmas! On Dec 25, we uploaded UPS2.0, which adds a more gentle difficulty curve (I hope) and approximately doubles the length of the game. We also introduced a speedrun mode so you don't have to play through the dialogue if you're going for time.<br/></p>CreditsDesign/Programming<p>Phillip Ai, Nathan Pinsker, and Anderson Wang</p>Art<p>Character sprites and animations by Nathan Pinsker</p><p>Platformer tileset by Zack Alvarado (http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-tilesets)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/273/2734ec5be3dd3ae9cc22622d592e3d85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["amp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
