The game is a handful of choice-driven, voice-acted calls and text chats with Harper.<br/><br/><ul><li>~25-30 min playthrough<br/></li><li>12 original music tracks<br/></li><li>2.5 endings (2 primary endings, with one having an additional choice at the end)<br/></li><li>Harper voiced by Catsen (ttv/catsen)</li></ul><h3>Choices in Over The Phone</h3><br/><br/>Most choices are part of a tone system, which include a word below that describes the tone/intention of that line.  Making choices of a particular type makes it more likely to have similar choices later on and fewer choices that conflict with that tone.<br/><br/>If you played Drinks With Abbey, you're probably familiar with how unforgiving the game is when it comes to choices.  You needed to pick specific ones throughout to get the \"best\" ending.  In OTP, that's not the case. The types of choices you make do decide which ending you get, as well as change the conversation and future choices.  But it's more flexible in terms of which specific options are chosen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T03:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dac/dacd1a8fc175b17c681a7592da2b751c.jpg", "website": "https://ramifygames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ramify Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ramify Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
