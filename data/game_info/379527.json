Thanks for buying Ambienz, we hope you enjoy the experience.<br/><br/>We wanted to let you know some of the background behind this game and why we chose to publish it. It was developed by just two people. Byron, a very experienced game developer in the UK  who\u2019s worked for games studios like EA, Sega, and Lionhead, and Joseph, a Professor working at a school in the USA teaching game development to the next generation of game developers. In other words, this wasn\u2019t made by some faceless corporation pumping out mass market games but an artisanal approach to game development, made by hand by two people who cared about it a lot.<br/><br/>Byron wrote the code while Joseph designed the levels. Joseph is a child of the 60\u2019s, which might go some way to explain some of the \u2018trippier\u2019 levels. To both of them, Ambienz is an attempt at providing an antidote to the turmoil and hate that the world seems to be going through at the moment. It\u2019s designed to be something you can pick up and chill out to rather than be fast paced and adrenaline-filled. You won\u2019t find any violence in this game, just abstract procedurally generated levels to explore and relax in.<br/><br/>One of the other reasons we decided to publish this game was the technology behind it. On the outside it may look humble but on the inside there\u2019s a lot going on. Each level is procedurally generated which means technically, if you wanted to, you could go on playing forever. Then there\u2019s the music. It sounds simple but the music is being composed in real-time using an \u2018AI\u2019 procedural music generator. It\u2019s like having a live musician improvising a tune right next to you - that\u2019s what the music generator in Ambienz is doing. It\u2019s impressive technology.<br/><br/>So, we hope you enjoy it and if you do, please leave us a review!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T03:28:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/577/5773f2685ca96ad310fb2bf02ceb66f7.jpg", "website": "http://xiotex-studios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Byron Atkinson-Jones", "Joseph Jolton"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Xiotex Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
