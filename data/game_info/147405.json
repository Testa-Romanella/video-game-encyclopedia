However, you are not one to stay put. Fight your way through hordes of enemies, gruesomely sticking their limbs to yourself as you go! <br/><br/>-- <br/><br/>This is a game that Lianne Booton of Team Sadbrains and Pixelbear put together in 2 and a half days. Pixelbear did the programming, Lianne did the art! <br/>We took the theme in a slightly different route to most people - instead of having the graphics minimalist, we decided upon reducing some of our favourite things about other games into their core elements - such as simple fighting mechanics, basic character customisation and a little bit of stat building. We hope you have fun, and thanks for playing! :D <br/><br/>-- <br/><br/>Credits <br/>-------- <br/>Programming - George 'Pixelbear' Baron <br/>Art - Lianne Booton <br/><br/>Music - <br/><br/>Ove Melaa - Heaven Sings (Omsofware@hotmail.com) <br/>Zander Noriega - The Wreck @codingobviously</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ea/3ea98b75204db61241e69322e2e81133.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pixelbear"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
