The deeper they continue, the more ways they will learn to\u00a0wield this power against their enemies.<br/><br/><strong>But this curse comes with a heavy cost</strong>: If Amadan tries to draw upon the dark magic when they have not yet suffered enough, the darkness will instead feed upon the very fabric of their\u00a0life force itself. <em>(Luckily, between each fight they will find time to rest and recover)</em><br/><br/>Harm Charm is a game about thinking ahead and\u00a0managing resources turn by turn.\u00a0\u00a0Created for GGJ2022, we chose to use the two iconic stats in most classic RPGs (health and mana) as our\u00a0<strong>duality</strong>.\u00a0Because the game might take you a while, we have included a password system.\u00a0The password to return to each level can be found on the Adjourn &amp; Return menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T10:02:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db27431c9e788554c2a22cafd22ee895.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jjohnstongames"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
