It's a management/tycoon game, but it also has adventure game elements, and the game manages to find a balanced combination between the two. As you progress in the game, you can manage and control the production of your gadgets. The game starts slowly, but it's easy to get into the business. The 2D top-down views of the production halls and offices are impressive. Gadget Tycoon is a well-executed game that is fun, intricate, and goes beyond a standard tycoon game by including adventure and story portions. The game is reminiscent of Tycoon games in terms of the way it weaves together graphical style and gameplay styles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T07:38:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b059e878b44706649f056269525db2b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 500, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monte Cristo Multimedia", "Montegamesc"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Take Two Interactive", "Mon2Ggamesinc"], "esrb_rating": null}
