Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs from it&#39;s predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8c9/8c9be5c6075e1fff4cecd5695252a288.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Climax Racing"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
