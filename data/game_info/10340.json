{"id": 10340, "slug": "crusader-kings-ii", "name": "Crusader Kings II", "name_original": "Crusader Kings II", "description": "<p>Crusader Kings II is a global RTS which takes place in the Middle Ages of Europe. The players will govern a house of nobility of that time, and ensure that its heritage will last for centuries. The second installment of the series fills the gap in the developer\u2019s continuum of global strategies, allowing for lengthy grand campaigns and world conquests.<br />\nThe main points of interest in the game are your noble house, holdings, and vassals. Players can engage in diplomacy between neighboring households, sign treaties and create a bloodline between two families, forge documents and declare wars. However, the primary competitive objective would not be conquering the world, but instead, winning the prestigious ranks and ensuring that your family will prosper.<br />\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics revolve around interactions with your neighbors and your court. Buildings built, armies trained, but most importantly, your character should be built, too. Education, marriage, religion - everything will affect your lord-protege, and players often come up with different guides on how to achieve success without regards to the luck and skill of the player.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2012-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T19:55:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c22/c22d804ac753c72f2617b3708a625dec.jpg", "website": "http://www.crusaderkings.com/", "rating": 3.59, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 517, "owned": 6298, "beaten": 167, "toplay": 49, "dropped": 335, "playing": 72}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 161, "ratings_count": 727, "suggestions_count": 503, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 733, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Paradox Development Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Paradox Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
