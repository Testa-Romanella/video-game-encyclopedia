After the highly acclaimed success of its predecessor, Compile took a slightly more retro approach, so players had a more original feel to the game over that of Tsu.<br />\nThe name of Puyo Puyo SUN comes from a Japanese pun on san, and also indicates a new Puyo brought into the game. As Sun Puyo were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (san (\u4e09) is the Japanese word for the number three), the name served multiple purposes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-24T09:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/91b/91bcaf1bf74aa78af11a68abf9f8a426.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 395, "game_series_count": 17, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "Nintendo 64", "Game Boy Color", "PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Compile"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Compile"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
