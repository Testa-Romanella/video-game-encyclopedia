An internet classic from...a long time ago. Now on slightly unimpressive on\u00a0Game Boy!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zip through mazes! Avoid...walls! Reach the end!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you ever played the original way back in the day please don't ruin the cute surprise at the end for anyone, cheers haha.</strong></p>\n<p>Originally started on something completely different to this for the GBCompo 2021, but a lack of time as well as that project kinda evolvin' into something bigger than I\u00a0expected meant I\u00a0wasn't quite ready in time. Mainly due to not having a playable build I'd be happy with lettin' out into the wild yet (stay tuned though, should be done soon).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soooo at the last minute I\u00a0quickly whipped this together so I at least have some kind of game entered haha. Been wanting to make this since around the time I\u00a0first found GBStudio so it's been neat to finally get a chance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aaaanyway, hope you enjoy this quick lil thing and I look forward to tryin' out a bunch of the GBComp 2021 entries.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>And cheers for playin!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>[The ROM's A\u00a0More Recent Version Than The Web Build.
