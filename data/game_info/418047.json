Rather than attacking the stalker, the mechanic is to use the bushes to hide behind while he passes by. However, to prevent the player from staying hidden too long, there is a \"panic\" meter. With each note the player picks up, the game gets harder with the stalker getting faster and faster. After collecting 5 notes, the player has to reach a house in order to complete the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6ee9f57f0575546a30b0887a95729531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoularBearStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
