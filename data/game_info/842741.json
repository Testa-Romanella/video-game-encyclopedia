If your browser doesn't start the music automatically, activate it by clicking the music button in the top right corner twice. Leave the audio and sound effects on - I love them and they <em>are </em>motivating!</p>\n<p>Use A and D to accelerate your bogie and flee from the Sheriff!<br/>HINT: Use both hands, one for A, and one for D...\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This submission was super funny to write and I caught myself playing for over an hour to get 60+ speed, so there's a challenging highscore for #TriJam #rocknightstudios to beat during the live stream!</p>\n<p>What shall I say...
