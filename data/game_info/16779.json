{"id": 16779, "slug": "bittrip-runner", "name": "BIT.TRIP RUNNER", "name_original": "BIT.TRIP RUNNER", "description": "<p>In the fourth part of Bit.Trip series the player controls Commander Video, a small featureless character, as he runs eternally to the right through a pixelated landscape. He jumps and slides to evade dangers, such as giant caterpillars, angry trees or soaring fireballs, and kicks to attack them. He has no hit points, and any hit means you have to restart the level again. Commander Video always runs, the player cannot stop or reverse the movement and is only able to make the character perform certain actions, such as jumps, at the necessary moments. <br />\nCommander Video&#39;s movements are perfectly synchronized to music. When movements are performed right, new notes are added to the game&#39;s chiptune music score. Even pushing an unassigned button will result in playing some musical sounds. The run becomes quicker with time, raising the game&#39;s difficulty, but also giving the player more control and influence over the soundtrack. The game&#39;s visual style is that of simple and colorful pixel art with a &quot;retro&quot; feel to it. There are three \u201cworlds\u201d in the game, each of them includes eleven levels and ending with a boss fight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72f1e176e1affdf7a6c0e49e167080d7.jpg", "website": "http://totallychoice.com/games/bittrip-runner", "rating": 3.32, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 76, "owned": 2232, "beaten": 75, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 156, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 253, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 254, "platforms": ["Wii", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Choice Provisions", "Gaijin Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aksys Games", "Choice Provisions", "Gaijin Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
