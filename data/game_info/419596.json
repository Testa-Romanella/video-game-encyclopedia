Within the outlined play area you can place 15 different elements and see how they react.<br/><br/><strong>This is the Oculus Quest version of VR Sand.</strong></p>\r\nFeature List\r\n<ul><li>Supports sitting, standing, and 360 degree room-scale configurations</li><li>Stretch the box to make it larger or smaller</li><li>Left and right-handed support</li><li>Variable brush sizes</li><li>Source blocks that generate other blocks</li><li>Due to performance limitations on the Quest, this supports up to 24x24x24 particles. This size was chosen to allow you to do whatever you want within the space (including filling it up with explosives)\u00a0and not get any frame rate dips.</li></ul>\r\nParticle List\r\n<ul><li>Water</li><li>Fire</li><li>Sand</li><li>Stone</li><li>Plant</li><li>Concrete</li><li>C4</li><li>Gunpowder</li><li>Oil</li><li>Gas</li><li>Dirt</li><li>Seed (put in Dirt to grow plants)</li><li>Void</li><li>Lava</li><li>Ant</li></ul>\n<p>I've decided to put this up for free because due to performance\u00a0it's a much smaller playspace then the PC Version on Steam.\u00a0But if you like it, feel free to donate.</p>\n<p>I plan to eventually add\u00a0saving functionality, on all versions of VR Sand.</p>\n<p>I don't plan on adding more blocks because that will decrease performance even further, and thus require an even smaller playspace. If I'm able to add any more without that issue I might, but please understand there are no promises of further elements.<br/><br/>Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:05:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fec/fecb1128be216c711ba591dc334b7123.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phylliida"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
