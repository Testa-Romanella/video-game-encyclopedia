It is an arcade platformer, featuring Pillowman, a superhero named by someone watching my livestream. The theme was \"10 seconds\", so the current \"goal\" as well as the configuration of the platforms on the field change every 10 seconds. I used the Crafty JS game engine, but ended up having to use a Box2D port instead of the built-in movement mechanics, leading to lots of game feel tweaking. On the upside, it allowed me to make the bullets fully physical objects, so it's fun to watch them bounce around. Unfortunately, the constant spawning and de-spawning of robots resulted in some intermittent performance issues. You can see the original description, comments, and ranking here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc6/bc6a24ed463ed4ba62cef4620f3002b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spencer Alves"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
