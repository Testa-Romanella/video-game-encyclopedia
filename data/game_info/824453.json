This is a traditional style RPG, where the turn based combat is replaced with Flyting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything in this prototype is placeholder, default tilesets etc, its very messy. Im using RPG Maker which has its own limitations also, but really helps with the traditional RPG feeling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm really hoping to get feedback on the gameplay concept, mainly do you think this would get hold after a few hours, no matter how good the story may get?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T14:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41d3f2e2c05b9cdd87113146bf2e346d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ryanmcleod"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
