Chickens trying to collect things with skiis. Chickens taking turbo burst to go way faster than they should.

They made me choose two random topics, and the make a game about it. I chose chicken and ski, and I ended up doing this.</p>\n<p>I may or may not have used Stardew Valley's chicken sprite as inspiration for my chicken sprite. I'm really bad at making sprites.</p>\n\n<p>Music:\u00a0http://freemusicarchive.org/music/BoxCat_Games/Nameless_the_Hackers_RPG_Soundtra...</p>\n<p>Font:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/es/vcr-osd-mono.font</p>\n<p>The rest of the assest are made by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/3474a2274541d61a465c5d9290d74440.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Red Scoresby"], "genres": ["Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
