As with the first series, main courses require cooking and some may need Flo to prepare two different kinds of food in the same dish. Flo has to keep an eye on the food that is on the stove, otherwise it will be burned if left for a long period of time. Grandma Florence helps out in the prep counter for food that does not require cooking. Desserts, snacks, snow cones and drinks require less preparation and can be served right away.</p>\n<p>(Source of Description - Diner Dash Wiki; &#39;Cooking Dash 2: DinerTown Studios&#39;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T01:39:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f5bd430992c3b1376e57312536ac266.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PlayFirst"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
