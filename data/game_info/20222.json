Test your mettle with the fantastic American Powerhaul standalone, featuring the stunning Sherman Hill route.<br/><br/>Running 60 miles between Cheyenne and Laramie, Wyoming, the route is well-known for the tough grades which resulted in the Union Pacific Railroad building new heavy freight locomotives to work the line. The first single track railroad was laid in 1868, passing over the summit at 8,247 feet, and the route was steadily upgraded with double tracks and stronger bridges in the following decades.<br/><br/>Experience the power of the fuel-hungry Big Blows across the challenging Sherman Hill as you haul hundreds upon hundreds of tons, putting the 8,500hp Union Pacific Gas Turbine through its paces, or opt for some conventional traction in the form of ES44ACs, drive in more comfortable conditions in the wide cab of the SD70M, or maybe in the classic SD40-2s. Watch out though, winter can be brutal even for the most powerful of locos.<br/><br/>American Powerhaul comes with a number of scenarios designed to test even the most experienced of railroad engineers:<br/><br/><ul><li>Introduction to Sherman Hill<br/></li><li>Welcome to Cheyenne<br/></li><li>Granite via Wycon<br/></li><li>Running the #3 Track<br/></li><li>The Midnight Magnet<br/></li><li>Arrival of the Thunderheads<br/></li><li>Introduction to the Turbine<br/></li><li>Simple Switching<br/></li><li>Straight Up Switching<br/></li><li>To the Max and Back<br/></li><li>Red Line Run<br/></li><li>Haulage to Granite<br/></li><li>Hard Haul to Granite<br/></li><li>After Noon to Laramie<br/></li><li>Lashing Down to Laramie<br/></li><li>Big Blow's Descent<br/></li><li>Don't Brake Concentration<br/></li><li>Manifest Itself<br/></li><li>Enduring the Manifest<br/></li><li>Full Throttle Over Sherman<br/></li><li>Through the Storm Over Sherman</li></ul><br/>Plus, three Railfan scenarios at Cheyenne, Sherman Hill and Laramie.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de5/de5260af5ca087adf5855a746c5a3c92.jpg", "website": "http://www.train-simulator.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dovetail Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Dovetail Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
