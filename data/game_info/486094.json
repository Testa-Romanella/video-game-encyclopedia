The game requires players to write out their own solutions to these challenges using nothing more than a keyboard and their imagination.   </p>\n<p>The game tackles \u2018blank page anxiety\u2019 and other barriers preventing young people from engaging with creative writing in the classroom.\r\n</p>\n<p>I did a great deal of research into creativity and how we can encourage it, especially through games, before beginning work on this project.\u00a0This proof of concept was then created entirely from scratch over an eight-week period, to test and receive feedback on gameplay and mechanics. As a result there may be a few bugs, but nothing that should get in the way of understanding the concept.</p><p>If you're interesting in hearing more about this prototype, and the pedagogical theory that informed its creation, drop me a line; I'd love to talk more about it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T05:53:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80de3cd794f43dfafe12634c33bae985.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["George Larkwright"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
