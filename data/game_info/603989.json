{"id": 603989, "slug": "overgrown-2", "name": "Overgrown", "name_original": "Overgrown", "description": "Overgrown is a fast paced resource management game in which you have to keep a multitude of houseplants alive. Play increasingly difficult levels until you become a master gardener capable of anything your precious plants require. Test your strategy and fast feet against unique obstacles such as temperamental cats, voracious swarms of bugs, and your homes clutter in order to keep the plants in your care happy and healthy.<h3>Feature List: </h3><br/><strong>Organize Your Plants to Give Them the Correct Sunlight</strong><br/><br/>\tJust like in real life, each plant has a preference for how much light it receives. Place plants near windows or in dark corners depending on their personality, but bear in mind that they may not be able to stay there!<br/><br/><strong>Keep Your Plants Hydrated</strong><br/><br/>\t These plants are always thirsty! Fill up your watering can and give each plant the amount of water it desires. Sprint if you need to get somewhere quickly, but beware of spilling your watering can. <br/><br/><strong> CATS!</strong><br/><br/>\tThose cute, fluffy, cuddly demons who love to knock things over are coming to terrorize your plants! Save them a cozy spot by the window and keep them out of the catnip to prevent them from deciding your plants look better on the floor!<br/><br/><strong>Beware the Bugs</strong><br/><br/>\tSome of your plants have developed an insect infestation. To deal with that, they made the wise choice to grow some carnivorous plants. Make sure that your plants are eating the bugs and not the other way around!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T02:53:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d82/d821a269611d94176d0eb05236c67728.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tiny Moose Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tiny Moose Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
