{"id": 456737, "slug": "super-star-brawl", "name": "Super Star Brawl", "name_original": "Super Star Brawl", "description": "<p>This is a huge\u00a0modification of the existing\u00a0 'Little Fighter 2' game made in 1999. Up to 8 characters fight for their life in a flat 3D environment using special moves and weapons that scatter throughout the match. Use your skills to be the last one standing\u00a0in a large variety of over 20 characters!<br/></p>\n<p>The game has more modes beyond 8 player fighting: Stage mode, 1 on 1, 2 on 2, or Battle mode. In stage mode, traverse 5 stages in waves of enemies with up to 8 players fighting and befriending bosses while rescuing captives! Stage mode also has a Survival stage where you try to last as long as you can against waves of enemies and bosses. 1 on 1 and 2 on 2 are tournaments with a total of 8 participants. Enter alone or with a teammate to win against the other combatants! And in Battle mode, 2 teams fight with a set amount of followers and healing items to see which team will last.</p>\n<p>All characters have been replaced with characters I made and have been heavily edited by me to have entirely different moves or edited existing ones from the original Little Fighter 2. Stages have also been edited to have entirely different aesthetics. New characters and stages have also been made to mix things up. Not only that, but the stage mode has also been completely altered to have waves that more resemble a series I made before.\u00a0All of these create an entirely new experience to those who have already played the original.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T06:53:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d94920498631cd4a7a4c87e3f787c6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tinyclover"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
