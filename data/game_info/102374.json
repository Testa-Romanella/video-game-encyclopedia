This game is the result of the author's creation and imagination.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EMPTY HEAD<br/>[Psychological Horror - Mystery]</strong></p>\n<p>I've been inspired from other indie horror games such as The Cat Lady and Downfall (Remigiusz Michalski) and from my love for the psychological horror genre. The plot is entirely made up by me.</p>\n<p><strong>Plot:</strong><br/>In the small hamlet of Elkedor lives the Baker family, isolated and almost ''inexistent'' for the townsfolk. Arold, family man and lawyer with no fame, enters in a difficult time of his life between alcholism and a falling apart marriage. His days began getting filled by drinking more and more, while his wife and their two children, Sarah and Thomas, started to get detached and cold. One night the two went missing. Desperate at the thought of losing them he decided to investigate until, thanks to clues found in the house, succeeds finding a hidden passage. Lies, compulsions and hatred are the summary of what underlies in the ambitious Baker family.</p>\n<p><strong>The full game features:</strong><br/>Blood | Alcohol Use | Disturbing Elements<br/>A only <strong>True Ending</strong><br/>1-2 Hours of Gameplay<br/>Puzzles</p>\n<p><strong>Characters:</strong></p>\n<p>Arold Baker: Laura's husband and father of Sarah and Thomas.

Thomas has a big passion for insects and his dream is to study entomology.
