Sun, fun, beach and a huge crush!<br/><br/>Enjoy a fantastic summer holiday in the sunny south. Explore a massive holiday resort with your best friend: Dancing at the disco, step aerobics at the fitness center orshopping at the beach promenade - the skyis the limit. Win the heart of your dream boy, whom you can design the way you want him at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Intrigue him in interesting conversations, impress him with fun mini games and fascinate him with your style. If you bitch and bicker he'll probably leave you, and if you don't make any money walking dogs you can't afford the coolest outfits. And keeping watching your mobile, because he's bound to text you any minute! <br/><br/>Flirt, shop, relax and have tons of fun in this great game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/162c0079e18cf28053d07e39487ce0fe.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/rokaplay", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Exozet Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Anikids", "TREVA Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
