Be aware though, some pillars are special, and either require multiple jumps off them to destroy them, or even cause a global effect like an earthquake.</p><p>There are 9 levels of hell where the main theme is destruction, followed by 9 levels of purgatory with time and tempo as the main obstacle. Last but not least, the last 9 levels are in heaven where pillars can be ressurected to reach the end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9a/b9a7c5c91224a529c4722968236333bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ziga.osolin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
