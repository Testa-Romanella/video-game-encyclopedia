You will dash depending on the position of the mouse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With middle click you can perform a power recoil shoot that will inflict more damage and you can use it as a propellant. (After this shoot, you will not be able to shoot for 3 seconds).</p>\n<p>The normal shooting is automatic.</p>\n<p>So perform combos with the dash and the recoil shoot and dodge the enemy attacks.</p>\n<p>The game will stop either if you win or lose.</p>\n\n<p>This is the link of the google drive of my code</p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z298PcJN6P7fRSFmcI_JFaYDvPDSaJTH/view?usp=shari...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T06:23:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8f91791e6ce897b9357266bf861db65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Galleta12"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
