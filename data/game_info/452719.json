I wanted to remake it to learn how it could be done, and since its 2D, I can make my own assets for this project. The characters and abilities are themed after the fantasy series Mistborn.\u00a0All the code and art assets are done by me.\u00a0I have been working on it since January 2020.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Currently only has mouse controls. Recommended playing on full, widescreen (1980x1080 or similar aspect ratio) I have not fixed the scaling on it yet.</li><li>Bottom left corner has two tabs (red and blue) to switch between the map and the character stats/abilities. Clicking on the squares (rooms) on the map moves the party.</li><li>Combat is pretty similar to Darkest Dungeon, where you click a button to activate it, which highlights characters that can be hit. You then click the target you want to cast the ability on.</li></ul>\n<p>Currently working on:</p>\n<ul><li>Adding 2 new characters (almost\u00a0done)</li><li>Adding items - adding costs to use abilities like ammunition.</li><li>Affliction and stress system</li></ul>\n<p>Final Plans:</p>\n<ul><li>6 Playable characters, with changeable ability load outs</li><li>At least 4 enemy characters (1 Boss fight)</li><li>An full level containing a series of fights and intractable choices.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:35:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37f96b2cab4b4cb715bcf9ae72b75ce8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EccoS"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
