Pit \n      yourself against wave after wave of enemy forces while using your high \n      speed boost maneuver to fly in 8 different directions to avoid fire with \n      the goal of total enemy annihilation. Defeating any enemies on screen \n      will decrease the \"enemy potential\" gauge which will give way to a \n      powerful boss upon reaching zero. Keep an eye out for flying cargo boxes \n      which will yield helpful items if destroyed.
