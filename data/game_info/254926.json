And, being Eric, you realise that you must at all costs remove your report before it comes to the attention of the Headmaster.<br/><br/>The combination to the safe consists of four letters, each master knowing one letter and the<br/>Headmaster's letter always coming first. To get hold of the combination, you first have to hit all<br/>the shields hanging on the school walls. Trouble is, this isn't as easy as it looks. Some of them can<br/>be hit by jumping up. Others are more difficult. You could try and hit a shield by bouncing a pellet<br/>off a master's head whilst he is sitting on the ground. Or, being Eric, you may decide to knock<br/>over one of the boys and, whilst he's flattened, clamber up on him so that you can jump higher.<br/><br/>BACK TO SKOOL<br/><br/>Having managed to steal your report during the last few skooldaze of term, you've spent the whole holiday forging teachers' signatures and handwriting to make yourself look like the brightest, sweetest natured, most helpful little soul ever to carry a satchel.<br/><br/>Now all you've got to do is get it back into the Head's safe\u2026<br/><br/>A couple of years ago, your elder brother had exactly the same problem and has lent you his old copy of the School Rules, on which he's scribbled some notes in invisible ink.
