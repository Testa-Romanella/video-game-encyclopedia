My first ever decompile project! I feel very proud to be typing this and I hope you enjoy checking out my first ever decompile! I'm a noob so don't be too harsh on me! I will make more updates to it, but enjoy it how it looks rn! I don't know what the future holds for this project but I will make more updates to it, I might even expand the map! At this point in time the map is broken in some aspects, but I will fix it! I also gave some of the characters new voices (like filename2). (I tried my best!) More updates definitely coming soon!</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to:</p>\n<ul><li>Splinta and Punkred - Decompile help\u00a0</li><li>Punkred - Baldi renders used\u00a0</li><li>Splinta - Baldi model used\u00a0</li><li>MTM101 - OSB Project\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T08:03:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bad0ceadfe8a0e61110ebd96c0b01562.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GWAYthan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
