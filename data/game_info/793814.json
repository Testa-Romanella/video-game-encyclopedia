One of them has managed to create a unique HMI (Human Machine Interface) that will revolutionize the future. This is the story of one of the technicians working on optimizing such HMI.</p>\n<p>It is just another day of a normal week of summer, when the Thomas is connected to a maintenance robot through\u00a0the HMI doing a systems diagnostics and an \"accident\" happens. Someone has killed Thomas while connected to a robot. Little anyone suspected that the HMI allowed for Thomas to transfer consciousness to the robot.</p>\n<p>It is a race to find the murdered and pay them back.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a puzzle game in which the players needs to go from point A to point B, by solving puzzles and gathering information.</p>\n<p>The puzzles (sadly I was not able to add more complex stuff) is a basic game to bypassing doors. The player can either input the password, or they can bypass the door by using the maintenance connectors that simplify the inputs to a binary combination.\u00a0This usually means to go from, at least, 1000 options to 4, 8 or 64.</p>\n<p><strong>The controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard and mouse.
