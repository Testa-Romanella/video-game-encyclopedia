If there is interest I might take a look again some time, but I'd be better off remaking it from scratch in unity or something now.<br/><br/>An ambitious\u00a0proper sequel to the first game, this had a revamped quest system, full dialogue trees, characters, vehicles, and 3 branching stories, scout/medic/soldier.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, either Flash (at the time) or my PC got to a point where it could no longer publish it due to size. I would get memory issues and it just wouldn't publish. My fault for choosing the wrong engine!<br/><br/>Every line of code was written from scratch in AS3, and all assets created by me, it was a real labour of love! But sometimes you have to let go of things.<br/><br/>I sent this to PCGamer too, and got feedback which was nice. Mainly about how wooden the animation was. this was fair enough. I tend to agree. :D<br/><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0a/f0aae6cea5c62aeac790aa2dc12a2ffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stu's Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
