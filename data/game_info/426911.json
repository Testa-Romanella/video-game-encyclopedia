With all the news stories about people collecting toilet paper and causing a shortage, the player tries to collect as much toilet paper as they can and reach the checkout before the three minute timer runs out. If they run out, the player character \"thinks they're infected\" and ends the game. The player uses the W and S keys and the mouse to steer their character around the map. The shelves that the paper is sitting on are collidable, and may get your cart stuck, losing time. As long as the player is within range, they can press E to pick up a single (or multiple) rolls of toilet paper. Overall, we attempted to make more of a humorous approach to the hoarding.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:28:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/997/997993a0b0f3a55032b4b5addb05ba4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoularBearStudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
