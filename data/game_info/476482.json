The inspiration for the game came from my own family\u2019s chicken farm, which also happens to be right across the street from a bar.

Gain back lost lives by grabbing hearts. Oh.. and don't forget this chicken's movement is gonna be wobbly!</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move the chicken. Careful now! All the movement is inverted. So the up arrow key will make the chicken move downward.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:53:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/828bbeb720e5d2f91afc02dedb15a858.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ceiselm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
