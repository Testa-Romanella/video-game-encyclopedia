Each puzzle features one or more of these domino types with them all having a different effect: an X means digits in the two cells in the domino must sum to 10; a V means they sum to 5; a white dot means the digits are consecutive; and, finally, a black dot means the digits must be in a 1:2 ratio (ie one of the digits must be double the other).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you can imagine, when you allow the world\u2019s best Sudoku makers to use these rules they are in their element and they\u2019ve made another set of masterpieces for this collection with a huge amount of variety!
