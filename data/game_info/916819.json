The game takes policy and actions into account to give a semi-realistic simulation of real life. For example, many green energy initiatives are met with lobbying against them from major oil and coal organizations. This makes it difficult to push laws to combat climate change. Similarly, our player must balance their proactive choices with public policy support to ensure that they save the planet!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T06:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/904/90453705967b9846215024eb20264d82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Geoff"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
