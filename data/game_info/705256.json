There had been 4 suns (what we consider \"eras\") before\u00a0 ours and each\u00a0had ended by a flood, fire rains and other catastrophes. The Gods gathered around a fire and realized that they needed a sacrifice. A young and buff god, Teocicuiatl,\u00a0volunteered himself as sacrifice but backed out as he got closer to his death.\u00a0This\u00a0caused great dishonour amongst the gods. Nanahuatzin, an old and wise god, offered himself and all of his cacao for this ritual and did not hesitate. He ran across the \u201cBoulevard of the Dead\u201d and stepped into the fire pit. At that moment, the sun came out from the East. Filled with shame, Teocicuiatl stepped into the fire and a smaller sun appeared next to the Sun. The gods, who were angry at him, could not allow him to shine as much as the honourable Nanahuatzin. They looked around, saw a rabbit and threw it to the smaller Sun, turning it\u2019s fire out and permanently scarring it into the Moon. That is why the moon (in Mexico) has a rabbit shape encrusted in it.</p>\n<p>Yet, there was still unstability in the world dor neither the Sun or the Moon moved. The Gods realized they all had to sacrifice for the stars to move and hence, bring us life.</p>\n<p>In this game, you must collect all the cacaos you can find in the great ancient city of Teotihuacan. You move the camera with the mouse, move your character with the WASD and Arrow Keys. Use the space bar to jump and enjoy the scenary.</p>\n<p>There is much to be done to finish this game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T10:52:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/257/25782411b62caf759f4943d8b063cf08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bato Balvanera"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
