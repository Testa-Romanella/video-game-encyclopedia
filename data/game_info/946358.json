The full repository can be found\u00a0here.</p>\r\nBehaviour Tree\r\n\n<p>Pal's behaviour tree always checks for any commands from the player (set by gameplay tags) that override any other tasks. If not under command, pal stays by the player character unless an enemy comes into view, in which case pal prioritises attacking.</p>\r\nAttack Task\r\n\n<p>Once an enemy has been identified, it's added to the blackboard. This task sets pal as in attack mode (used by the animation blueprint) and makes an attack against the enemy.\u00a0 The task returns a failure when the enemy is killed so that the attack sequence node on the behaviour tree is ended, otherwise pal will continue to attack.</p>\r\nAnimation\u00a0Blueprint\u00a0\r\n\n<p>If pal isn't under specific command or attacking, the\u00a0animation blueprint uses a basic blend space that includes idle, walking, running, and turning animations. A separate blend space is used for the foraging command. State machines control the animations for waiting (in which\u00a0\u00a0pal lies down and stands back up when called to return) and attacking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T15:59:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ba/3ba13e490eab5617be6cf4be586c1733.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kirsty Kidd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
