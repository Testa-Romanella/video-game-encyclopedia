It's not snowing, but there's a bunch of buildings to smash down (and some extra-large TNT, too). Smash into them with enough speed to break them! You have 10 seconds to score as many points as possible. Leave no trace.</p>\n<p>Strategy:<br/>Time your boosts, watch the clock, and try to chain together TNT blasts for maximum damage. Plowing through multiple buildings will slightly increase your speed, so try to aim well.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Aim with mouse, left click to accelerate, right click to boost.</p>\n<p>Submitted for the GDFG monthly jam, made in approximately 3 evenings. More of a proof of concept than anything, but it's essentially a complete high-score style game.</p>\n<p>\"Leave something behind\" &amp; \"Mouse-only controls\" were the themes.<br/>What I\u00a0chose to leave behind: A rampaging path of destruction, never having \"finished\" a game, and the engine Clickteam Fusion.</p>\n<p>Fits in a nice and tidy 3.9MB.\u00a0Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T06:02:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/613/613db753797741c12f7322f4b885a7a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dotico"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
