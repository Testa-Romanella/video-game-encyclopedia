{"id": 721587, "slug": "ice-bumper", "name": "Ice Bumper", "name_original": "Ice Bumper", "description": "<p>A simple 2D top-down arcade-style game where you bump ice chunks and seals into the water without getting knocked off yourself. Pressing the spacebar allows you to do a spin attack which increases the knockback of collided objects. The game ends when you fall into the water.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Arrowkeys / W,A,S,D = Move\r\n</li><li>Spacebar = Main Menu Selection / Spin Attack</li></ul>\n<strong>Here is some of the things you will be interacting with:</strong>\n<ul><li>Ice chunks are commonly found and are the easiest for getting points and setting up combos.</li><li>Seals will actively try to chase and bump you, which causes you to get stunned. To\u00a0prevent this, be sure to spin attack them instead.\r\n</li><li>Rare ice chunks,\u00a0as the name implies, are rare and when they do show up, it isn't long before they disappear. They are worth a lot of points, so knock them off before they disappear!</li></ul>\r\nScoring:\r\n\r\nIce chunk50 ptsSeal200 ptsRare ice chunk (Purple)500 pts\r\n<p>Points rewarded are multiplied based on the number of collisions involved in causing the object to fall into the water. As an example, bumping a\u00a0<strong><em>seal</em></strong>\u00a0into an\u00a0<strong><em>ice chunk</em></strong>\u00a0which then bumps into\u00a0<strong><em>another ice chunk</em></strong>\u00a0that then falls into the water will reward 50 points multiplied by <strong><em>three</em></strong>! Try stringing together a bunch of collisions that knock some thing(s) into the water!</p>\r\nTry to go for a high score!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T06:23:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06da9a64d8fafad3adb66023b458bef0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BACON BEAST"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
