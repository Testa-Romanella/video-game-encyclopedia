{"id": 25942, "slug": "boulder-dash", "name": "Boulder Dash", "name_original": "Boulder Dash", "description": "<p>\n      Boulder Dash, originally released in 1984, is one of the big \n      computer-game classics. It is one of the very few computer games ever to \n      be ported from home computers to arcades (contrary to the other way \n      around). The hero of the game is the brave prospector Rockford. He must \n      dig through caves collecting diamonds, while avoiding various types of \n      dangerous creatures and obstacles like falling rocks. He is in constant \n      danger of being crushed or trapped by an avalanche or being killed by an \n      underground explosion. Strategy and planning are the key to master the \n      \"physics\" of Boulder Dash. Once the indicated amount of jewels have been \n      collected, the door to the mysterious escape tunnel is revealed and \n      Rockford can explore another cave.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. See more Virtual Console games for Wii.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/82465787775f8af74067fe75fec890d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Commodore Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
