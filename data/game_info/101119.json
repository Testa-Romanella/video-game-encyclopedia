IF YOU'RE ON CHROME, USE THIS SLOWER BUILD.<br/><br/>With one week left till school (starting high school!!!), I decided that a partaking in this game jam would be the perfect way to ease myself back into the pressure and general sleeplessness that accompanies school life. Thus I present to you, ladies and gentlemen, a beautiful ragdoll-and-blood-filled game featuring a genetic algorithm, a reference to 'The Killers' and my amazing piano arranging skills (as always, made in much less than 48 hours). <br/><br/>The \"game\" is a simulation of the development of (killing) technology - from ancient stuff (chucking bricks and rocks) to excitingly complex things like guns that fire guns. <br/><br/>What you have to do is simply to answer the questions at the start (these act as parameters for the simulation) and enjoy the ensuing carnage. The machines get pretty good at taking out entire crowds of ragdolls at about generation 5 so be patient. <br/><br/>Timelapse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKk3MG4ZF74<br/><br/>Also, if any of you guys feel like building the game in Unity Pro and making it into a screensaver, hmu because that would be fab. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/620/6201c3812f6076e1264be66b5ed39eaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PetertheHe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
