You are an agent who protects the president, but you are really bad at your job. If you fail your mission, the president will hate you. But at least you are alive, right?</p>\n\n<p>Theme connection: You failed to protect the \"president\", but you get out of the store alive and you are the real president. Therefore you failed a mission successfully because you are the president so you protected yourself.</p>\n<p>controls and mechanics:</p>\n<p>WASD for moving and click your left mouse button to shoot. Use R to reload.<br/>Trash cans around the level are checkpoints so make sure to step on those!</p>\n\n<p>This game is made and\u00a0submitted for the CCC jam in 4 days.</p>\n<p>-&gt; CREDITS &lt;-</p>\n<p>Programming: Goldax</p>\n<p>Visual and Sound Design: Shoie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T08:14:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68c/68c863b37cf529db8759d08871abc7de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shoie"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
