You look around and notice a flock of crane flying over you. You breath in profundly, then exhale. You grab your fishrod and begin to fish...</p>\n\n<p>ShanShui is a relaxing, interactive experience immersing the players into a Chinese painting through virtual reality. Take a step away from that hectic way of life and start breathing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>First of all, you'll need to attach a hook to your bobber. Grab it by pressing a trigger while hovering over it and release the trigger while hovering the bobber. Different hooks attract different fishes!</p>\n<p>Cast your line,  \u00a0breath deeply; don't rush and be patient. </p>\n<p>When a fish bites, concentrate and try to move the hand holding the rod towards the\u00a0strongest vibration to reel the fish closer. Take the time to find the sweet spot, there's no timing involved !</p>\n<p>Play with sound for more cues and a better immersion. Enjoy the game!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p><strong>The team :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>ShanShui was made by a group of five ENJMIN students in the span of three months</p>\n<p>Quentin BORDES ....................................
