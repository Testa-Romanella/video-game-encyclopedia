I was able to reproduce much the\u00a0GM 8.0\u00a0 drag-and-drop in GML Visual. To recreate the high score I had to use the asset pack \"High Score Table for Game Maker\u00a0Studio 2\" I had to tweak it for this game. The original game had 3 levels. I have add two more levels with faster-moving asteroids, smaller moons, larger planets and smaller planetoids.</p>\n<p><strong>FROM \"The Game Maker's Apprentice\" book<br/></strong>The example games in this book have been brought to life with graphics and illustrations\u00a0by real games industry artists.

You must safely steer a course from moon to moon while avoiding dangerous asteroids, large planets and smaller planetoids You are paid for each delivery you make, but pay is deducted for time spent hanging around on moons. This adds pressure to the difficult task of orienting his rickety old rocket, which cannot steer very well in space.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>While you are on a moon:</strong><br/><left>\u00a0 rotate launching direction counter-clockwise<br/><right> rotate launching direction clockwise<br/><space> launch the rocket</space></right></left></p>\n<p><strong>While in space:<br/></strong><left>\u00a0 rotate direction of motion counter-clockwise<br/><right> rotate direction of motion clockwise</right></left></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T05:41:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d4e178c3622e6e66534438cba5e6081.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["the1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
