Its a pseudo-class, a build. Something for the module to use as reference to wich kind of NPC should it build.</p>\n<p><em>What is the seed field?</em></p>\n<p>All NPCs are randomly generated and the seed is the 'starting point' from building a character. From there the build grows into the NPC. If you use the same seed with the same configurations you will get the same NPC.</p>\n<p><em>Why maximum CR is 12?</em></p>\n<p>Because from that point on the NPCs would start resembling monsters, with legendary actions and/or too many hit points to feel anything 'humanoid'.</p>\n<p><em>What version of Foundry does it currently support?</em></p>\n<p>Its supporting both v9 and v10.</p>\n<p><em>For how long the module will be maintained?</em></p>\n<p>At least by the end of 2023. If plenty of people are using it will be maintained indefinitely. In any case, there will be a 6 months notice before maintenance stops.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: in the screnshots I use the Tidysheet module (a free module for sheet visual) for demonstration purposes, because it condenses most character tabs in a single screen.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T15:29:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3ed0d1475282c47ac04ff270f1cf83e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mad Wizard"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
