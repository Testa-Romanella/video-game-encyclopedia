The first thing we did was set up all the UI focused on importing the assets that were given to us. After that we started to most of the items on screen to be interactable when you left click on the mouse button.. After that we started to make the formula on how to edit the chocolate. WE would be given a formula where we simply had to solve for X. After that we started to work on having the chocolates to show up in the chocolate bar as you increased the number. If you get the question wrong you would be able to try again and this time a hint button would appear which would show the amount of chocolate. Once we got the button to show we worked on making it so the chocolate would be visible as we added the amount, we need it to visual show us the answer. Finally if you were successful we would have a short animation in which the chocolate goes into a bar and we feed the NPC. We then would work on the next equation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T16:56:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/274/274f4051a1a529d4b249f9e5f9df4171.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stephen Pappacena's Portfolio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
