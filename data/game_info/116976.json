{"id": 116976, "slug": "puzzle-tv", "name": "Puzzle TV", "name_original": "Puzzle TV", "description": "<p>Puzzle TV, is a game originally made for my 4 year old and 9 year old daughters.  It's a non-violent 2D top down movement/puzzle game.  It is being built from the ground up for modding. Things such as levels, sprites, items even the font are changeable.  As progress continues more of these will be accessible and editable.</p><p>It is currently early alpha.  The basic systems are in place but there is no real level design, or artwork beyond the place-holder.  Regression bugs can happen at this stage.</p><p>It is updated regularly, with new features, bug fixes, graphics and behind the scenes alterations to expose more of the internal workings.</p><p>Level creation and other information is in the README.</p><p><strong>Latest changes<br/></strong></p><p>Larger levels (now 20 x 20)<br/>Scrolling<br/>Added switches so Exits can be locked.</p><p><strong>Source code lost.</strong>  We lost the hard disk in the development machine.  So duly bought another and tried to recover the backup.  Turns out that disk had died some time ago but I never checked.  So this project is on hold until I find the hard copy of a slightly older version of the source code....  And always check my backups in future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/354/354b431cba597245696c6782c60c92fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["1022 Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
