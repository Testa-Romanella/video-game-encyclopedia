You play as a little tank thing and shoot the \"bubbles\" and try not to be hit by them, there are different types of bubbles, powerups, only 20 levels, local score board and score multiplier. It's just like the old bubble popping games except they are big squares. I couldn't be bothered making any sprites so I just used a white pixel stretched and re-coloured, even the letters and numbers are all done with one white pixel.</p><p>There is an option to donate money to me but I am absolutely not expecting anyone to pay for something like this. I am kind of just posting this one here and forgetting about it, I will check back every so often though. I am working on other bigger projects, a city builder and an adventure type game. But if anyone does donate to me I will be eternally grateful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdf/bdf8b973aa12d353964fb9322bf69b3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iiskitty"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
