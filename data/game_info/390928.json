You must battle them and drive them out for the good of your homeland and for the sake of the forest so as to not let it all fall into ruin. Homeland is a pixel art game with a nice bright fantasy style and a soothing soundtrack for your exploits. It features a big forest map for you to explore and of course bandits to kill or not kill if you so choose. The game isnt 100% complete unfortunately but nonetheless I hope you all enjoy and good luck!</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Top down perspective</li><li>Hack and slash combat</li><li>One large map to explore</li><li>Fun and challenging combat</li></ul>\n<p>This was my first attempt at making my own game, its not 100% complete and I wasn't able to add everything I wanted but I had a lot of fun making this as part of a Uni Assignment.
