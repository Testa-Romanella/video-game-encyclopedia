Like this game, many real people must navigate daily the pedestrian-hostile world of our suburbs, experiencing the same level of frustration and annoyance that this demo seeks to inspire. My hope with this project is that it is novel enough to generate at least a small amount of conversation about how we choose to design the places we work and live, and maybe to inspire interest in better alternatives.\u00a0</em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/9170e7defd45bb617b854840034ae8fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["roberts concepts"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
