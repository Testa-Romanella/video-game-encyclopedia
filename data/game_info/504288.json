The goal of the game is to sail the seas making quick and lucrative trades, surpassing your rival in the process. Jump from port to port loading up on stock and then offload it when demand rides high! You only have limited time to prove your worth, however, so be efficient. Only the most determined of traders can prevail!</p>\n<p>Cycle of Pawmerce is meant to be played with two people (it was designed with the Winnitron arcade machine in mind), but there is also a single player mode where you can go for the high score.<br/></p>\n<p>Competitive trading game made during Ludum Dare 47.
