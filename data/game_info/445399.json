I love them so much and I feel like they need more love!</p>\n<p>The story is developed around the battle with the Tsukiyamas (i.e. Rose)\u00a0. There will be a route which completely displays what the manga does, but I decide that this is too sad and there should be alternative endings.</p>\n<p>So! Based on your choice, will you be able to lead Koori and Hairu to a happy end?!</p>\n\n<p>Although I finished this game, this is going to be the first version and is intended for bug exposing as in the short description. It doesn't mean I did not test the game myself, but there could be more potential bugs than I thought since I know what will come up next and would go straight to it.</p>\n<p>Also, since no translator works for my game... I have to do it manually. That's why there's only a Japanese version. It's in Japanese just because it's easier for me to write the dialogue that is the best fit for the characters. I'm neither a native Japanese speaker no a native English speaker\u00a0so potential mistakes are expected.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T05:49:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb3/fb3d9216cf23b7af87fe61707b1b392f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rinne_yukisawa"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
