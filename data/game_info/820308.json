Her loadout? Three D20 dice. She\u2019ll use these dice to move and open doors, but she will have to be careful how much she rolls. While Rachel\u2019s movements don\u2019t make a sound, rolling dice across concrete does. She\u2019ll have to weigh her options, choose when and how many dice to roll, and get out of the base as fast as possible. With luck, this agent won\u2019t die, she\u2019ll just roll them.</p>\n<p>(Works best in Google\u00a0Chrome.
