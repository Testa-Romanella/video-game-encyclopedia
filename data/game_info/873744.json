It has a retro style and a very simple concept. You Drag to shoot But be careful there is a cool down, the objective is to destroy all bricks before the time runs out. The bricks and Time limit are random allowing for relaxed gameplay which can become tense as you slowly run out of lives. I made this in 2 days but don't worry I put a lot of effort into this game making sounds and sprites. This is my first game (that I'm publishing) so please message me about any bugs at cratior#7703 on Discord.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T09:48:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/836/836e98b37c8caae9d90f6aa0f32e3bfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cratior Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
