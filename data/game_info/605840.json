Your Owner is always either giving you too much or too little water, they don't fertilize you enough, they placed you on a shady bookcase when your label clearly indicated your need for direct sunlight! But you've heard of a mystical place: the Neighbor's place. They're much better at caring for plants than the Owner is. If you can make it to the Neighbor's, you'll get a much higher standard of care . . . but you didn't think it'd be THAT easy, did you? Get around obstacles and battle malevolent forces as you travel to your new home with your other plant friends!</p>\n<p>Grow As You Go is a Lasers and Feelings hack.
