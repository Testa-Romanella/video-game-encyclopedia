This is our second game. We have used Unity for the first time ever. \u00a0This release is basically a demo. There only 4 items, 3 enemy types\u00a0and 1 level. We also didn't have any artists so the assets are... there. We have used AI to generate them and used Clip Studio Paint to edit them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The width of the features we wanted to implement are there, however we couldn't explore them in the depth the game deserved.\u00a0Don't forget to\u00a0give us feedback, we are looking for ways to improve our game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't hesitate from joining us in this journey!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T10:12:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1e/c1ea606d39f97fa4af3422e2e61866ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cem Kaya", "bersoy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
