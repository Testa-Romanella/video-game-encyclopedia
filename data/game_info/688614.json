You'll encounter many different types of passengers that have different personalities and roles. Some may be nice, some might be bad and a few might even let you engage in a fun mini-game! Just board the train and enjoy the ride...</p>\n\n<p>Encounters play out rather simply, you enter a carriage and click the passenger you want to talk to. This will either lead to multiple dialogue paths that could kick you off the train, restart the dialogue or allow you to continue through to the next carriage. You may even enter a carriage that has set or unique piece of dialogue that leads into a mini-game, for even more fun!</p>\n\n<p>You can earn currency from the mini-games, which will allow you to buy new colours for the train and even the mini-games which you can then play whenever you want. Future cosmetics are planned for the shop, including external train decorations and even themed terrains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Further content is planned, but for now a Halloween content update will arrive on launch with the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T10:06:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/104/104f3c3df7c671a9bf312eb8b02904a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WideLuke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
