Once your\u00a0<strong>Commander</strong>\u00a0is defeated, it\u2019s game over. Over time the waves of enemies will increase in size, frequency, and abundance. You\u2019ll need to think fast to dedicate the appropriate type and amount of troops to counter your enemies\u2019 plans while also having a quick enough hand to execute your strategy in time. Everyone will eventually be overtaken by the unending onslaught of foes, but how long can you hold your ground?</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p><strong><em>Hold The Line</em></strong>\u00a0is played exclusively with the\u00a0<strong>Mouse</strong>. All unit commands and selections are performed via the\u00a0<strong>Mouse Buttons</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Mouse Wheel</strong>\u00a0(or the\u00a0<strong>Q</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>E</strong>\u00a0keys if you\u2019re on a track pad). You will always have full vision of the entire battlefield and can deploy your troops anywhere you\u2019d like. Troops are dispatched by spending\u00a0<strong>Supplies</strong>\u00a0in proportion to the size of the unit being deployed.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button (click and drag):</strong>\u00a0Scale/Orient New Unit\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button (release):</strong>\u00a0Deploy New Unit\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Right Mouse Button:</strong>\u00a0Cancel New Unit Creation\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse Wheel or Q/E Keys:</strong>\u00a0Select Unit Type!\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f21/f216daec6907d7987e209ec666459673.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["pwnofprophecy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
