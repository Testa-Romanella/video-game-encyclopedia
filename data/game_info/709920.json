By splitting yourself into multiple copies you have to maneuver onto all goal tiles simultaneously to progress.</p>\n<p>The goal with this game was to iterate on a few novel mechanics in a sokoban world, and play with the consequences to discover interesting scenarios. The game contains 50 puzzles that intend to explore those mechanics.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Linux version built and tested on Debian 10, Debian 11, and derivatives.
