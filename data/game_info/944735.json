Otherwise, use arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Bottom Feeders:</p>\n<p>Collect the ripe fruit. Pears give you +5, rotten gives you -1, and regular fruit gives you +1 points.</p>\n<p>Luck of the Draw:</p>\n<p>Pick a card. Any card! When both players pick a card, whoever has the greatest value wins that round. When a player loses 3 rounds, the game is over.</p>\n<p>On the Move:</p>\n<p>Move away from the boulders!
