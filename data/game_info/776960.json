This is the <strong>SECOND</strong> in\u00a0a series of small prototypes being developed to get the hang of working in the\u00a0Defold\u00a0engine, and get a head-start on some of the minigames that will be available in the larger game. (Check out the 1st Prototype Here)</p>\n<p>This second prototype continues more with the flashcard game mechanics, but now introduces a\u00a0<strong>Spaced Repetition System</strong>, or SRS for short. SRS is a scientifically proven method for learning and easier memory retention, while minimizing unnecessary revision. If you've ever used Anki, or Duolingo, you've experienced this sort of mechanic in action.</p>\n<p><em>(As an important side-note, if you're currently not studying Japanese, you may not get much out of this in it's current state.)</em>\n</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<ul><li>This second prototype lets you review the kanji.

All have their pros and cons, but trying to use multiple methods at the same time has proven incredibly unwieldy. Additionally, different methods progress at different rates or have different lesson plans, so doing 2 lessons concurrently leads to a lot of wasted effort.\r\n</p>\n<p>I've tried some games to help me study hiragana &amp; katakana, and those were great. But after graduating from that, the game space for language learning dried up. There are some interesting games out there, but they didn't quite click for me\u00a0as they tended to be somewhat superficial- only focusing on a small aspect like simply teaching you vocabulary. They tend to also\u00a0stick pretty closely to \"traditional\" Japanese-as-a-second-language education, while there's some pretty excellent literature out there on better ways to approach language acquisition and make it stick.\r\n</p>\r\nThe Refold System\r\n<p>In devising my own lesson plans, which I'm implementing in the game, the biggest source of inspiration is the\u00a0<strong>Refold</strong>\u00a0system of language study (which is an evolution of the\u00a0<strong>Mass Immersion Approach\u00a0</strong>to learning a new language). Refold mirrors a lot of what I'd been reading about Stephen Krashen's\u00a0research into language acquisition.\r\n</p>\n<p>The core guiding philosophy of Refold is\u00a0<strong>immersion in the language</strong>: where you can learn a language much faster and easier if you are constantly surrounded by it (usually\u00a0live in the land using it) and are required to adapt to it, versus trying to practice it in isolation.\r\n</p>\n<p>While myself or most anyone can't quite pack up casually and move to Japan, I'm aiming to build a game with\u00a0all its design around this philosophy, and push the learning language games\u00a0field forward.\r\n</p>\n<p>And finally, just the act of having to research and verify the language to use it properly in this game has been a helpful exercise in retaining what I've learned so far.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nSign up for more upcoming Prototypes and development news\r\n<p>Please feel free to leave comments and feedback!\r\nOr reach out to me at\u00a0Belief Engine.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T10:17:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/550/5507bd986343606089d761babf010ca0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Belief Engine"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
