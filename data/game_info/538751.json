One of them factory-fresh and on the way to join the fighting\u00a0- to die for her insane god's visions of victory</em><em>. The other abandoned by his heroes, </em><em>doesn't know</em><em>\u00a0anything but war and grim hatred for the enemy - but he</em><em>\u00a0is hellbent on finishing a mission that was never meant to be finished</em><em>.<br/><br/>When their world collapses, is there a way for them to put aside all they ever believed in and\u00a0survive together?</em>\n<p>In this game you follow in the track marks of one of\u00a0two soldiers who are\u00a0fighting in the conflict that followed WW3 and the extinction of humankind.\u00a0That war is called the Great Machine War, as it is fought by war machines powered by AI. It's a merciless and bitter struggle, its fronts hardened after more than 20 years of fighting.</p>\n<p>No one knows when it will come to an end, neither side willing to budge even an inch.\u00a0It seems like nothing and no-one\u00a0could reconcile the two factions and their leaders, even if all sense and purpose of their conflict is long forgotten. After a long deadlock on the frontlines, there is almost a sense of equilibrium, a new normal.</p>\n<p>But then, an event of cataclysmic dimensions shatters the world they know and forces everyone to reconsider their definitions of friend and foe, and everything they thought they stood for.</p>\r\nEARLY ACCESS DEMO\r\n<p><strong>This game is still in early development.\u00a0Its current state is not representative of the finished product but should give you an idea what to expect from it.</strong></p>\r\nCurrently implemented features:\r\n<ul><li>player tank operation (driving, shooting)</li><li>one playable tank</li><li>ammunition mechanics\u00a0(penetration, reloading, switching)<ul><li>three ammo types: AP, HE,\u00a0HEAT</li></ul></li><li>interactive environment<ul><li>destructible trees, tank tracks leave marks, water waves</li></ul></li><li>a test map\u00a0(the \"Proving Grounds\")</li></ul>\r\nPlanned features:\r\n<ul><li>character customization<ul><li>player can find/buy and equip new parts</li></ul></li><li>inventory system</li><li>two playable tanks</li><li>interacting with NPCs and objects</li><li>intertwined stories</li><li>several maps</li><li>choice between \"realistic\" and \"arcade\" controls/mode<ul><li>different gearbox types and ground physics</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T06:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bf/2bff856b417f98642c82b2bc8047ec6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OnTrack Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
