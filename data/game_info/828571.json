Here, the \"garbage\" are instead some cute (?) critters called \"Leeshos\". A Leesho usually comes to try to help a player who is losing by some margin... as long as you don't hurt them. Don't drop stuff on them, neither make matches that cause them to fall from a height, or else they will be hurt and unconscious for the rest of the game. If you treat the Leesho well, it will leave, giving you some gift in exchange - maybe a multiplier bonus, or some points... maybe even points enough to surpass your opponent?</li></ul>\n<p>Everything was made by me, except the music and the text font (which are Public Domain).</p>\n<p>The current version was made for the Pacifist Jam (Honest Jam IV)</p>\r\nDefault keybindings on the embedded emulator\r\nPlayer 1\r\n\r\n<ul><li>F: A button\r\n</li><li>D: B button\r\n</li><li>Enter: Start\r\n</li><li>S: Select\r\n</li><li>Directional: Arrows\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>There are no default binding for Player 2, they can be changed clicking on the D-Pad icon on the top right.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T03:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48e55e554e5237a750e1011747659ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wendel Scardua"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
