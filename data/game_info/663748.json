Although the game looks like a real-time battle, it is actually a turn-based game. The protagonist\u2019s skills are the same as those of monsters and summons. The cooldown is calculated on the same schedule. When the cooldown time is up, the player can get a corresponding number of uses of the skill. Compared with the traditional turn-based game, our game is more flexible. As long as the skill has the number of uses, you can use it, and the rhythm is faster. If you don't know how to use the space bar to pause the game If you do, you may even feel that you need hand speed<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe protagonist will have a fixed role skill and a random skill at the beginning. As the monsters gain experience, the protagonist will upgrade to obtain new random skills. The combination of skills with high affinity will double the protagonist\u2019s combat effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers can get money from battle. Money can buy equipment in the store, and use the purchased equipment to synthesize advanced equipment with better attributes. You can also change skills in the skill store. No matter how good the skill set does not have the attribute support of the equipment, it will not work. Yes! Some advanced equipment will even provide passive skills. Of course, the equipment will only take effect if you wear it on the protagonist, don't forget!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to buying equipment, money can also buy mercenaries in the mercenary market, and you can also spend money to upgrade mercenaries purchased before, up to the same level as the protagonist. Players cannot control the actions of mercenaries, but mercenaries will be selected by monsters As the goal, it can disperse the pressure of the protagonist's blood volume, but once the mercenary is still dead at the end of the battle, it will be removed from the team.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the recent version of the game mechanics, we have added a new mechanism: treasures, unlike equipment, treasures are often free and obtained through the victory of boss battles, but the positive effects of treasures are often accompanied by negative effects. After all, there is no free in the world. For lunch...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is a save button at the bottom of the settings panel. After saving, you can use the load game button to return to the current situation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is currently under development. It is best to use the save button frequently.
