I was debating on whether or not to submit, but I figured that I could use this as a first milestone in my journey as a game developer. It will be fun to see how far I've come even 6 months from now. Hope you like what little is here. Feel free to leave criticism, but I am aware of the many things this game still needs (entire art assets, bigger enemy variety, hazards, actual cut scenes, transitions, shaders, finalized music/audio,etc.) I learned a lot here and am excited to see where I go from here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you do end up playing my game, I appreciate you taking the time to check it out. <br/></p>\n<p>Matt<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:55:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/718/718fa1cac90cbf526194393641f57d55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Denny'sGuy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
