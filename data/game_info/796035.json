Literally, nothing special here. If you don't know how to spend your precious time on earth, give this game a try and see if you can get as many clicks in a row as you can! <br/>\n</p>\n<p>Creator's Note: This is my first publicly released game ever and as I am still learning to code and working with game engines such as Unity, I decided to create a small and simple game. I just wanted to see what releasing a game is like. As I said, I am still learning and this game is just a little experiment. Never meant to be taken seriously. But to be honest, it was actually pretty fun to make! My next games will be \"better\" as I'm constantly getting more and more experience and knowledge from doing these little projects. If you want a \"real\", \"serious\" game, stay tuned for my next release! \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T09:49:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/957851b23efa34d0412843b19f1a2f0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sproto"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
