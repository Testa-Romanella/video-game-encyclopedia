It features a database of fictional movies that you, the rental store clerk, will sort through to find the right movie customers want. It also features a Commodore-64 style game. It has about 9,000 words of dialogue and other readable text.</p>\n<p>Game design-wise, I started it as one type of game (job simulator) and this portion of the game was quicker to make than I had anticipated, so I added the Commodore-64-style game as an extra. But then that part of the game was so fun to make, it became a bigger part of the game. The third section of the game is mostly-dialogue. All three portions of the game were fun to make.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please let me know in the comments if you liked the game overall, or if one part of it was more fun than the other, or anything else I should keep in mind.</p>\n<p>This game was worked on from September 13, 2021 to September 26, 2021, for a couple of Game Jams.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:18:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a3df07d8d2bd307f142998660cbb25c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SnakeWinter"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
