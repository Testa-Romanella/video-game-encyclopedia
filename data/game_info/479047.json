One of the first things that came to our minds were the little toy rewind cars we used to play with when we were young. That inspired us to make this game.\u00a0<br/><br/>It is a\u00a0 2-4 player\u00a0co op game and it is a little buggy put we worked hard on it. Play it with your friends and please leave feedback below. We only have controller support so that is something to know up front. Make sure to heck out the controls.</p>\n<p>All Assets were made from scratch ecept for a few particle systems.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45bc51cc83994cd702dfe4e6d272f40a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hans Meulblok"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
