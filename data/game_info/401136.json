{"id": 401136, "slug": "solitaire-project", "name": "Solitaire Project", "name_original": "Solitaire Project", "description": "<p>A small game I've created to learn Godot Engine and inspired by golf solitaire and similar games like  Faerie Solitaire.</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<ul><li>Only the topmost, unobstructed cards from the tableau can be removed. When a card is removed, the cards that were beneath it and are no longer obstructed become available for play.</li><li>To remove a card it has to match the current one from the stock. Cards match if they are either one rank higher or one rank lower.</li><li>Cards rank A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K and there is \"wrapping\" (Ace on a King and King on an Ace). The Joker is a special card that matches any other card.</li><li>Whenever there are no possible plays, turn cards up one at a time from the stock.</li><li>The hand is over when the stock is exhausted or there are no more cards in the tableau.</li></ul>\r\nIn development:\r\n<p>Right now you can play hands based on a couple of card layouts and randomly modified depending on the selected difficulty (by default the difficulty is set to random). I haven't had the time to fine tune the difficulty so there's room for improvement there for future versions. Also, I'd like to add a mode with more hand crafted levels and objectives at some point.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T02:55:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b7a03c75a21299bab35e25d8383d319.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["binarynonsense"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
