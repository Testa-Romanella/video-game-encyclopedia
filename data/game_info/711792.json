In this game, you play as Mike who is trapped on the piece of ice that float on a lake. But the ice is melting! So you have to jump on the ice tiles until they break. But somehow, there's a restart button that spawns new, unfrozen ice below you, so you can live here eternally. You technically can, but will you survive there?</p>\n<p><strong>=CONTROLS=</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&lt;-</strong> - move left</p>\n<p><strong>-&gt; </strong>- move right</p>\n<p><strong>[SPACE]</strong> - jump</p>\n<p><strong>=GAMEPLAY=</strong></p>\n<p>You have to jump away from melting ice (it melts suddenly, without any indicator), and you have to collect\u00a0 to reload the entire ice layer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T06:53:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0b/b0b98d8a360892587da49e99566764dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lasermtv"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
