What started out as a normal haunting extermination has turned into a race for survival.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You're trapped in a house with only one way out. You have to find the three skulls hiding somewhere in the house and destroy before you become a permanent resident of the estate. The skulls could be hidden anywhere. In closets, under tables, in jars or barrels or even just lying on the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are three types of ghost that hinder your progress in the game:</p>\n<p>Casper the not so friendly ghost, the black phantom,\u00a0 and the worst of the all\u00a0 the plague. It's best to use your iron sword against all your foes, maybe just against everything in the house.</p>\n<p>There are three different house layouts that are randomly chosen at the beginning of each start so you have to stay on your toes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good luck and hopefully you don't have to stay too long in the house!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/246/2462b7fe4910b2b90ba7a9c7113a78f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KeskiDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
