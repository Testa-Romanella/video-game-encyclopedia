If you like Portal or Superliminal, you'll probably like <em>Push the Button</em> (though as it was made for a Jam, don't expect as much depth.)</p>\n<p><strong>PSA:</strong> For the best experience, please download the game. WebGL is provided as a convenience, but offers inferior performance (AKA you'll get stutters as new areas load) and visuals. Though if you're wanting to play on Web GL, it's heavily recommended to use a Chromium-based browser. \u00a0Firefox has a weird issue with the mouse controls. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Team:\u00a0</strong>Just 1 dude with a heavy helping from the unity asset store.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Den of the Drake and The Bear Bard for additional voices</li><li>Crowe's Perch and Zydein for testing</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Asset Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Radio Music &amp; some sound effects - Motion Array</li><li>Various sound effects - George Hufnagl, Sidearm\u00a0Studios, GameMaster\u00a0Audio,\u00a0Universal\u00a0Sound\u00a0FX</li><li>Various icons -Qubits, KatGrabowska, Game Vanilla</li><li>Various models - Asset Store Originals, float3D, Polylabs, Elcanetay, Reynard Droste</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T11:45:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f06/f068265823ccbf34daa38a8545a507d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kunic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
