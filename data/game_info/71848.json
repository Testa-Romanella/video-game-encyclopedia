It's your job to help out with filling the orders of all the hungry kids, who want to fill their mouths with sweet caramels, chocolates, fruit bonbons, crunchy cookies and crispy waffles. But it doesn't end there. Some will want yummy gummy and jelly bears, nuts, marshmallows, jam donuts or gum bubbles! Others just come over to see the dough mixers spin, buy a gift bag filled with goodies, get some jars of syrup or a can of soda. Be careful with the empty jars though, they'll quickly get in your way. And if that's not enough to make you yearn for sweets, there will be some complex orders where you'll have to fill an entire basket with candies! Also let's not even mention the conveyor belts that will make your job just a tiny bit harder. Or easier, if you play it smart!<br/><br/>NEW WAYS OF MATCHING<br/>Sweet Candies 3 doesn't stop at simple lining up candies to make match-3. Making matches of 4, 5 or 6 will create super candies and rainbow candies. You can also create an explosive bag of popcorn by matching your candies in a 2x2 square.<br/>Entirely new in the world of candy matching is the doubling up of candies! Just swipe a candy over another one of the same type, and it's doubled! This will become a useful strategy for those who are not afraid to experiment. And yes, tripling is allowed as well!<br/>Of course, you can also mix and match the various bombs and special candies for a massive sugar rush blast!<br/><br/>BEST BOOSTERS EVER<br/>Although boosters are entirely optional, they can be a great help in your journey through candyland. The Joystick let's you collect candies using one of 3 unique patterns. The Candy Gun can be used to shoot and collect all candies of a chosen color, while the Sugar Paintbrush will change one type of candy into another one! Finally, the ultimate dessert is our huge Ice Cream. Drop it on the candy grid however you want to collect a huge amount of sweets!<br/><br/><br/>For more match 3 sweetness, check out our other games on the store.
