It's a color text based game in which the player tries to dodge falling Blocks by moving left and right. Usually, the whole game is controlled from the arrow keys. In Normal Mode, collect Bonus Points to get +50 score. Wanna play with a friend? Invite your friend to play on WSAD with 2 player with Two Player Mode! The half-cooperative dual play version of DodgeBlock. Sadly DodgeBlock is programmed in C# .net framework, so it only works on Microsoft Windows, but we're working on a Linux port in .net core.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T03:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94f/94f98f784c8211cfd549372564889378.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["othello7"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
