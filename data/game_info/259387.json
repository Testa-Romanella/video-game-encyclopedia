This game was made in 4 days for the 7dfps 2018 and procjam 2018. This is also the first time I am ever making an FPS! The level layouts are procedurally generated and then filled with content which has been pre-made; targets are added later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The level generation is pretty straightforward as it basically walks a random path on a grid to reach different rooms and then backtracks if there is no way for it go. I rewrote the code from one of my earlier prototypes, you can read more about that\u00a0on my blog -\u00a0https://yadurajiv.com/2017/05/28/spelldown-devlog-3-weekly-roundup/</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun staying up trying to finish this on time. Even if it isn't extremely great, I'm pretty happy with what I have done in less than four days :) and yay!! Two jams one shot! lol :3 Thank you for checking the game out! &lt;3</p>\n<p><strong>What is this game?</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to clear the targets and get to the end of the level with the best stats possible. There may be a snack at the end of it for you :) If you want to replay a level, start the game without changing the seed. If you find any interesting seeds, do share them here.\u00a0If you find any bugs, do leave a comment below.
