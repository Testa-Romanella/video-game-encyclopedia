A puzzle game about a lone coder seeking to create a program that can simulate cooperation. You play as just another bot in the simulation, and must work hard to collaborate and help with\u00a0your fellow AI to reach your goals. Will the next simulation be a success? Or will you fail to properly collaborate, AND BE SCRAPPED!\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>DEV'S NOTE:\r\n</p>\n<p>Hi, I'm Houston! I'm 13 years old and I have been toying with Unity for 1 1/2 years. This is my first Game Jam Game!\u00a0I'm really proud of how it turned out. Sadly, because I was taking quality over quantity too seriously, and was only working at most 6 hours a day on this game, there are only 2 playable levels. There are a few bugs that will be patched and developed on further if you guys like my game, like the Stuck-When-Going-Down-Stairs-Glitch (just turn around and come back down again), but it's nothing a quick restart can't fix. I also want to give a big thanks to the HeatlyBros YouTube Channel for providing the game with their royalty free music. Anyways, I hope you enjoy, I'm tired,\u00a0I'm gonna catch a break. See you.\r\n</p>\n<p>PS. This game is NOT controller-supported.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T21:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdbc99360800d209b0edd1857b9f6f77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Somewhat Nerd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
