Explore a dreadful dungeon and fight smart enemies that will plan and collaborate between themselves to defeat you.</p>\n<p>COMPLETELY SKILL-BASED COMBAT: Each enemy has its own set of skills, behaviors and collaborations. Learn their patterns and discover their weakness before they lay their hands on you.</p>\n<p>EXCITING PROGRESSION: Be responsible for rebuilding and maintaining your guild's village. Meet new characters, choose your traps, your weapons and keep track of your discoveries and unlocked content.</p>\n<p>HANDCRAFTED &amp; PROCEDURAL GENERATION: Designed to make each new run a completely new experience.
