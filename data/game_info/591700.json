You can beat it and there is no lose condition at the moment. There are quite a few bugs so I've added an easy reload (F10) for players to easily try again and avoid those bugs.</p>\n<p>Please report bugs to the projects discord here, see whats on the to-do list, and talk about the potential of the game:\u00a0https://discord.gg/FTTU9XACXy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T06:24:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/374/3749d96a8256a254cfed23703f953baf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarcZaFire"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
