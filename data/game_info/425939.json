As the sun begins to set,\u00a0shadow creatures take shape and the little girl\u00a0hops homeward. Now it is your time to shine, Guardian Angel, to make sure that she gets there safely by keeping\u00a0her our of harm's way. Destroy or distract various\u00a0enemies and change the environment. The more you influence the world, the harder the game will turn out to be. It is up to you when you decide to act and when you'll let nature take its course.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration &amp; Style</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by Eyvind Earle's concept art of the classic Disney animated film \"Sleeping Beauty\" of the late 1950s, \"Guardian Angel\" combines similar visual elements with a well-known and easily accessible genre, the 2D Auto-Runner, making it particularly suitable for mobile phones.</p>\n<p>The decision to interpret the color spectrum of the different game levels in a way that is contrary to the norm, allowed the game to have its own visual signature, while at the same time leaving enough time to create a well rounded gameplay experience through balancing, optimized level design, bugfixing, additional illustrations and supporting narration.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Design Decisions</strong></p>\n<p>The game mechanics are slowly introduced to the player,\u00a0through a cleverly designed screenflow, as they are\u00a0led linearly through a tutorial and then three levels, which intensify in difficulty. The focus here is clearly on the game's mechanics, which are supposed to force the player to react quickly through waves of enemies of three different types. The challenge arises from the fact that the course of each level varies slightly, as the reappearance of the opponents (respawns) is dictated by the timing of the player's actions and the individual game style. Illustrations and narration are used to subtly convey the context of the game and the lore to the player without hindering the flow of the game.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Download Log</strong></p>\n<ul><li>31.01.2020 - Build 1.0</li><li>xx.xx.2020 - Build 1.1</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cc/1ccecfacfdaa346a75778c572f2a2329.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["BelaB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
