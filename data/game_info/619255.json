Made for the GMTK2021 game jam.</p>\n<p>CONTROLLER REQUIRED! <em>(Bug warning: for some reason the game speeds up with each reset. I recommend refreshing the page instead for the time being!)</em></p>\n<p>Play as an anti-virus bot lost in the system, when a vicious self-replicating virus attack is taking place! You are always on the edge of overloading: a virus hitting you, and even dodging an attack constantly push you closer and closer. Do not fear however, as the closer to the edge you are, the stronger your attacks become, and your sensors become much more focused, perceiving time slower!<br/><br/>How long can you handle the onslaught?<br/><br/>P.S:<br/>Lots of thanks to my brother for helping with the music!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:01:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed458c84565ee627d79ddfe073dd0d44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LapnLook"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
