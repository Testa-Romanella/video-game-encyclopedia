{"id": 983, "slug": "wazhack", "name": "WazHack", "name_original": "WazHack", "description": "<strong>Time moves forward only when you do</strong> in the dungeons of WazHack, so you can take your time to solve problems instead of just spamming 'attack' and 'drink healing potion'.<br/><br/>With over <strong>300 unique items</strong> to be found, you will invent your own solutions to sticky situations. With over <strong>150 different monsters</strong>, many with unusual attacks, you will find plenty of sticky situations!<br/><br/>The <strong>procedurally-generated dungeon</strong> and vast array of possible items gives immense replay value. Some games you'll find a good weapon early, other times you'll rely on wands or potions or spells.<br/><br/>You don't see it much in the all-action video above, but some of the most fun is had just standing still trying to work out how to get out of a sticky situation. Should you try that unknown potion? Maybe it's Healing? What about that wand? Maybe it's Magic Missile... or maybe it's a Wand of Create Monster, and it'll get even stickier!<br/><br/>You start with your choice from <strong>16 character classes</strong>, each with different starting equipment, stats, belief system, and available talents. The game you play also depends very much on what interesting loot you find. Maybe you'll find a great spellbook and put all your efforts into turning your uneducated knight into a master battle mage!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-03T11:43:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/185f18c129fb7653e9e9f4cd6aefdf96.jpeg", "website": "http://www.wazhack.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 94, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 337, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Warwick Allison", "Waz"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Warwick Allison", "Waz Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
