The game wasn't intended to be named 'Dodge Covid', I just changed the name before uploading. If you want the audio to work you just have to click the buttons(in the settings) twice\u00a0(just one of the bugs in the game involving audio). Controls: Drag your mouse/finger on the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T03:51:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2ddf351ff76a803243a3e326a09724a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["snapshotworx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
