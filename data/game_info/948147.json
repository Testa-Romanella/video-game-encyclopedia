Dust off your jetpack, grab your dynamite, and prepare your laser eyes to dive deep into Klaus' first challenging adventure! \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou remember Klaus Lee, right?!  No? Well, you should!  He almost became a cop in Beverly Hills but then applied to be a private investigator in Hawaii and got bored waiting to find out if he got it. Moving back to Cali, he worked as an unknown stuntman while running a squad of troubleshooters that kept getting beaten to the clients by A much more successful Team. One time he barely missed his job interview at a New York startup and some dude named Zeddemore got the job as an exterminator of spirits. \n<br/>\nDid you know that Klaus trained Maverick how to both fly his jet and play killer beach volleyball? This is only a glimpse of everything he experienced living life to the max. Klaus was a really busy guy!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the first chapter of the famous action hero Klaus Lee. He was the role model for Colt Seavers, he made Chuck Norris walk as a toddler and prepared some water for Bruce Lee. He dated all Charlie's Angels at the same time in the same restaurant at different tables and he taught Steve McQueen how to drive a car. We are honored to work with him.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStrap on your experimental jetpack and fly through caves, dodge nasty insects, temple traps, and other hazards. But beware: fuel is not an infinite resource. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unknown creators of the secret temples build puzzles to keep intruders out of their sacred caves. Are you smart enough to solve them?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRiddles aren't the only thing keeping unwanted visitors away, you have to prove your skills against cursed walls, chasing spirits, moving stones, and other threads. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate your own levels. Jump in the level editor and discover the countless possibilities.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic platforming action with attitude </li>\n<li>Over 100 levels created by our cruel level designers</li><li>\n</li><li>Build your own levels with the comfortable level editor</li>\n<li>Share your level creations cross-platform with the world</li>\n<li>Discover a potentially endless number of user-generated levels</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T06:38:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97e/97e9a692f550b500fe5174e2a4b74e48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NUKKLEAR"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Assemble Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
