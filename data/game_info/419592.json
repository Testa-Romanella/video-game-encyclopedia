But all of Skullcrusher's weapons (and fortunately, those of his\u00a0enemies, too), are stuck to his giant electromagnet. You'll just have to shove the pirates off into the sea before they can do the same to you. Go for the high score, and see how long you can last.</p>\n<p>Super Pirate Box was almost completely developed by me during a 48-hour game jam at UC Irvine through the Video Game Development club. The design of the game focused on reducing complexity as much as possible rather than introducing more, and dedicating extra development time to the \"polish\" phases to give the game a distinct and satisfying look and feel.</p>\n<p>The game was developed using the\u00a0SDL\u00a0library and OpenGL rendering.</p>High Scores<p>See the high scores.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Uses SDL by\u00a0Sam Lantinga</li><li>\"The Flying Dingles Twinkles\"\r\nmusic by\u00a0NGXmusical(NGX)</li><li>Font \"Liberation Sans Bold\"\r\nby\u00a0Pravin Satpute, Steve Matteson</li><li>Sound effects\r\ncourtesy of\u00a0The Game Creators</li><li>Game title\r\nBlatantly borrowed from Super Crate Box\u00a0by\u00a0Vlambeer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:04:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af1399cb78380bd8bebdb78bc9e96e5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brian MacIntosh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
