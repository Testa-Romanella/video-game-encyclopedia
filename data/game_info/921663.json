Controls</p>\n<p>are as follows:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Hop</p>\n<p>This action is performed by tapping or clicking</p>\n<p>when both squares are not airborne or jumping.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Leap</p>\n<p>This action is performed by holding down on the</p>\n<p>screen or computer mouse to buffer another jump</p>\n<p>consecutively after another jump.</p>\n\n<p>Powerups:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Forced direction</p>\n<p>This powerup will force your next jump to be performed</p>\n<p>on the side of which the arrow is pointing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Orb</p>\n<p>This powerup will force your next jump to have full power.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of a level, you have 2 directions to</p>\n<p>split off to, swiping in a L/R direction on a</p>\n<p>touchscreen will decide which path to split off</p>\n<p>to. Alternatively, for computer users, A is for</p>\n<p>left, and D is for right.</p>\n<p>I think if i were to have joined the Jam on time,</p>\n<p>I would have added way more gameplay features.</p>\n\n<p>I rushed the level design :L</p>\n\n<p>Programming - Blahooga (me)</p>\n<p>+ FPS Extension by @Ahnaf30e</p>\n<p>+ Is On Screen Extension by</p>\n<p>@Bouh, @Silver-Streak and @VictrisGames</p>\n<p>Art - Blahooga (me)</p>\n<p>+ Free GDevelop Asset Store stuff</p>\n<p>Music - Blahooga (me)</p>\n<p>SFX design - Blahooga (me)</p>\n\n<p>There were some tracks that had to be scrapped due to lack of time.</p>\n\n<p>SOFTWARE USED:</p>\n<p>GDevelop</p>\n<p>Audacity</p>\n<p>Medibang Paint</p>\n<p>FL Studio Mobile</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T00:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d0051e9b08594ad0569e50942aba555c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["blahooga"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
