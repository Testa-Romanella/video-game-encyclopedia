This design is about 7.5 inches in diameter. This is made with Stitch Fiddle, and as I am not a pro and this is just my hobby, it is free to download. If you like it or any other of my cross-stitch patterns, I would appreciate a tip. Thank you\u00a0and as always, the commissioner is doing a great job!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Original Logo by Jadey on Discord.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T04:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a11a9a56c2b607813f578ece9e4f28df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Large Recycling Man"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
