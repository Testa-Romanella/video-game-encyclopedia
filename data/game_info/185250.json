We\u00a0  focused on getting great assets in and polishing up a decent central experience on which we intend to build--the resulting gameplay will include minigames played \"on-top of\" a 4p deathmatch game. <br/></p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates later this summer...and in the meantime, just enjoy blasting your friends with salt.</p>\n\n<p>Art by Steven Hancher @stevenhancher</p>\n<p>Code by Brendan McCracken @icynotesdx</p>\n<p>Music by Ben Roberts<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa9/aa9dc247e2363d776fb7423728cb4ae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["icynotes"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
