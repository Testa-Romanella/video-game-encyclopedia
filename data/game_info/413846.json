By right clicking and dragging, the user is able to \u201cpaint\u201d in whatever pattern they choose. With a left click, users are able to delete the objects they created. On the left side of the user interface, there are three sliders corresponding to each of the three available colors. Above those sliders is a dropdown menu allowing for the choice of one of three shapes to paint with. Finally, on the bottom right hand side users can \u201cliquidate\u201d the screen completely clearing their canvas. They may also toggle whether painted shapes disappear after a few seconds.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T05:02:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e31cd3bbe38a310466376cad6d786435.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AJS259"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
