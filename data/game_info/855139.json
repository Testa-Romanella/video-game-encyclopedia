You'll only be able to create 5 or 6 in total with the amount of Crystals available on this demo, and depending on how you use them. So you can get different teams on a new playthrough.</p>\n<p>Enemies appear on the overworld. There are no random encounters. If you choose to escape a battle (except Boss Battles), you'll be transported to safety at\u00a0the entrance of that area.</p><p>There are no save points, you can save wherever you want. You can heal at your house or at the Inn (for free).</p>\n<p>Future updates will include proper animations,\u00a0better graphics (colors),\u00a03 new areas, the conclusion of the story, and more!<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it! All feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T11:52:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82a/82afcb55431131c6218a5ad9ab6c7002.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ophidian Ren"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
