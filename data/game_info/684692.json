My father and his father and his father's father were all accomplished scary Halloween painters. Together with their help I have made the most amaze paint game the world has ever seen.</p>\n<p>I live in a very old house in the middle of the city. It has an odd layout with a triangular gable at one end. My sisters and I were always afraid of the downstairs bathroom. It was dark and dank. The toilet was a separate structure behind a thick flaking green toilet paper roll. The shower curtain rod was hung from the ceiling so it could make sounds like the metal snapping of a finger.</p>\n<p>As a result, it was always very cold in the bathroom. This cold was especially unpleasant since we had three children. I would go in to take a bath, but as soon as I shut the door, I would scream and run to the refrigerator. There I would hold a plastic bag of applesauce to my head as I soaked my sad little brain in sugar.</p>\n<p>I knew that if I could make a Halloween-themed bathroom that I would never be afraid of the bathroom. And so I did... oh yes, I did.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T09:53:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/770/77012768aeba1f3f758a5f8dbae0e220.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BigHardCheese"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
