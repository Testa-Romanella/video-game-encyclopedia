However, it is not a full-fledged sequel to the game but rather a spin-off. The game\u2019s tone and style are much more light-hearted and comedic than in the original, and the color palette is significantly brighter. <br />\nThe game\u2019s story takes place two years after the original game in a fictional town Night Springs, Arizona. The series protagonist, Alan Wake, must defeat his dark doppelganger, Mr. Scratch to escape the Dark Place. American Nightmare\u2019s gameplay is very similar to that of the original game; however, this time it is much more action-oriented, rather than story-driven. Its combat is centered around the same chief combat mechanic \u2013 focusing the flashlight on enemies on making them vulnerable to weapon.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2012-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-17T17:41:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0b3/0b34647c42271600399b93d19b10f1aa.jpg", "website": "http://www.alanwake.com", "rating": 3.4, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 483, "owned": 4426, "beaten": 650, "toplay": 95, "dropped": 180, "playing": 14}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 788, "suggestions_count": 467, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 794, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Remedy Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "THQ Nordic", "Remedy Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
