{"id": 978645, "slug": "real-life-3", "name": "Real Life", "name_original": "Real Life", "description": "You find yourself in a dark labyrinth dungeon, you need to find the key and defeat the boss to go to the next level or return to the tavern with the loot. The deeper you go down, the more dangerous the enemies become, but the reward is better. When you die, you lose everything and are revived in the nearest tavern penniless. You will have to find out what this place is and if it has a \"bottom\". The most important thing to remember is that the most dangerous enemy in the dungeon is a \"human\".<br/>\r\nThe development of the game is divided into two stages Roguelike and Mmorpg.<br/>\r\n1. Roguelike is based on procedurally generated mazes, I will be adding all the mechanics that I have planned, as well as maze modes. When all this is done and the balance including PVP between classes and builds is fine tuned, I will move on to the second part of the Mmorpg.<br/>\r\n2. Mmorpg will be based on Roguelike, without progression transfer, in fact there will be 2 different games in one client. With open world, siege and node systems, city management.<br/>\r\nFor the base of atmosphere and experience for players taken from various anime in the style of SAO \"sword art online\"<br/>\r\nand other similar anime about dungeons and survival in them. Also various works of litrpg such as \"Moon Sculptor\" or \"Heart of the Dragon\"<br/>\r\nGames that inspired me, let's say references that I look up to and try to carry over the best.  Ragnarok, Lineag2, Aion. Diablo, The Witcher, The Elder Scrolls.  Elden Ring.<br/>\r\nThe first thing I want to say is that I am making a game for myself, the game of my dreams), because I am disappointed in the game industry in pursuit of fashion trends and okazualivanie everything. <br/>\r\nI want to create a game with an old-school hardcore feel, where you don't play and live it, and your time spent isn't devalued by people. Where you find friends, enemies, love, join guilds, meet in real life.  You can go alone, or you can team up with a friend, but be careful, because a friend can shoot you in the back and take your drop. You can meet with another group in the depths of the labyrinth, and kill them, taking everything, but the value can be huge, you can negotiate with the strong and separate for a fee or together to defeat the boss, and then be what will be. The main thing in time to stop and after killing the boss to return to the tavern to exchange the drop for the necessary and become stronger. And here you are with your friends in full equipment ready to go further. Here at death you lose everything and maybe even your friends. Welcome to my world of Real Life.<br/>\r\nI also want to clarify, in all games I play as a sapparent, I am generally a good hitter), and I really like crafting. These aspects will be given a lot of attention. What this means, means that hit is a team player, and I will strive for that balance that good players in the team, but playing not coherently, will lose, average players, but playing as a team. <br/>\r\nSolo players will also have a place, but will need to have a high skill game. There will be worked out team play, but choose your party wisely, because there is a \"fire on their own\" On the complexity of the game will be reminiscent of Souls like games.<br/>\r\nWill there be Pay2win?   <br/>\r\nI want to say that everyone has a different concept of what Pay2win is. But since I'm making the game for myself, I just hate Pay2win. The monetization method will be as follows, but can change if it works out, the game itself will be free \"if we can effectively fight cheaters and bots\" and there will be a subscription. The subscription will include, x2 drop \"Core\" is the core of monsters, local currency, falls from each 1 pc. Also, such as increased carry weight, about 10-20% of the base weight. Maybe an extra warehouse or room in the tavern.
