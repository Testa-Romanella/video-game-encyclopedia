You will face 10 increasingly eldritch bosses, in 10 increasingly bending levels. Battle your way through the abyss to save a lost soul from a dark underworld.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Dual-Stance Combat </strong>- Epoch has two combat stances - light and heavy - each providing a unique gameplay experience and are balanced to be contrasting, yet complementary. Each stance has various movesets that can be unleashed by experimenting with different combinations and weaving the two stances together.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Combo-Oriented Movesets </strong>- Our combat is not limited by systems like stamina but instead based on the player's ability to chain moves together and react to attack windows. Successful combos reward players with even more moves, damage increases, and many forms of utility.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Essence Bar </strong>(white bar HUD) - A departure from classic action-combat resource systems, the Essence Bar is a resource that rewards aggression and skill. Players can strategically use and manage Essence to unleash powerful attacks or use it as utility in various situations.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>Earn powerful skills </strong>- After defeating each guardian, gain a skill point that can be used to gain a new passive ability via the skill tree. Traverse down one side of the tree to unlock a ridiculously over-powered final skill, or traverse across using the link skills to make the perfect build for your playstyle.\u00a0 In addition, you get an active ability that was that used by the enemy you defeated. Each ability will drastically change your combat style. Re-spec between attempts to try out different builds.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>Destroy the Guardians </strong>- The bosses are the focus of Epoch. Each punishing attempt offers new insight into the boss\u2019s mechanics. Use this to overcome each enemy as you travel deeper into the abyss and further from what you understand.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>LMB - Primary Attack</li><li>RMB - Alt Attack</li><li>Space - Dodge</li><li>Shift - Backstep</li><li>X - Change Stance</li><li>E - Essence Heal</li><li>L CTRL - Block/Parry</li><li>Q - Active Skill</li><li>T - Toggle Sword</li><li>R - Potion</li><li>MMB - Reset Camera</li><li>F - Lock on</li><li>Tab - Skill Tree</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T06:39:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dde/ddeead491125c4631c99c46ecc45c39c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Death Rattle Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
