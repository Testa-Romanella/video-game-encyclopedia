{"id": 917304, "slug": "caveface", "name": "CAVEFACE", "name_original": "CAVEFACE", "description": "<p>You, the player, wake up in a strangely large cave. It all feels cold, colorless, empty, and lonely. Luckily, you can solve those last three by crafting your own pet! Combine two gold nuggets into an ingot, and that ingot into a red ball, and you've got yourself your own companion! Defeat monsters, which can drop seeds which can be combined with another to create an apple which increases your pet's speed! To create a home for yourself, you can also break and place different objects, mostly taken from other randomly-placed structures scattered around the open cave.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was created in the span of about 4 months. Even if it's not much, I hope you all can get something out of it!\r\n</p>\r\n= CONTROLS =\r\n\r\n<p>WASD - Walk around\r\n</p>\n<p>Left click - Place\r\n</p>\n<p>Right click - Break\r\n</p>\n<p>Hold middle click - Crafting mode\r\n</p>\n<p>Q - Drop weapon\r\n</p>\r\n== Some crafting recipes ==\r\n\r\n<p>Push two moveable objects (i.e. nuggets) together while holding down middle-click to craft!\r\n</p>\n<p>- Nugget + Nugget = Ingot\r\n</p>\n<p>- Fluff Nugget (the pink stuff you mine from fluff ores) + Gold Ingot = Fluff Nugget (currently useless)\r\n</p>\n<p>- Red ball + gold ingot = Pet\r\n</p>\n<p>- Iron Ingot + Iron Ingot = Sword\r\n</p>\n<p>- Gold Ingot + Gold Ingot = Pickaxe\r\n</p>\r\n== Some helpful tips ==\r\n\r\n<p>- You don't click to attack with a sword, monsters that touch the sword itself get hurt regardless. It's reccomended to swing your sword just because :)\r\n</p>\n<p>- Enemies sometimes drop apple seeds which, when two are combined, create an apple\r\n</p>\n<p>- A lot of stuff is pushable, such as ingots and other objects, so feel free to see what can and can't be pushed.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T09:29:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbd1cef05126bf7ef4fb727ed5698552.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthono220"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
