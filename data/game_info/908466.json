You lead the way, but you can hang back as your team takes out the various bad-elements in the city.</p>\n<p>An Asteroid crashed in Regulator City, and an Alien substance called the Ooze started seeping out of it. This was quickly turned into a drug mutating who-ever Oozes up on it. Gangs around the city have been using it to become stronger and more dangerous.. but our scientists made a safe version to level the playing field by giving you super abilities!<br/><br/>So come lead your team to regulate the city and control the Ooze!</p>\n\r\nYOUR TEAM IS YOUR WEAPON\r\n<p>In this top-down shooter you are not alone, you are backed up by a team of trigger happy experts. They will help you out by taking down enemies, breaching doors, gathering intel, and destroying stuff! Use them as your main weapon!<br/><br/>You can lead the pack - but you can also just dictate the direction and let them do the dangerous work. It's all about you surviving the missions.. we can clone new team mates !<br/></p>\r\nSHAPE THE CITY\r\n<p>Completing misisons will allow you to select new buildings for future missions, and the type of building is important!
