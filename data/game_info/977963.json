You will need to rely on your teammates if you are going to make out of the city alive.<h3>LIGHTNING FAST ACTION</h3>New Alestead has a disease... and you are the cure! Dispense justice quickly and thoroughly because these criminals wont wait to attack you one at a time.<h3>EVERYTHING IS A WEAPON</h3>Sometimes you need to improvise! Use crates, barrels, planks, bits of door, arms, a variety of City Watch approved civility moderation tools or even your foot to bring criminals in dead or alive.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>MISSION DISPATCH</h3>It's not all City sanctioned murder and wanton property destruction, sometimes you actually need to arrest some people, secure contraband or escort important VIP's out of the city.<h3>ON STAKEOUT</h3>When you find the criminals hideout, you will be outnumbered and outgunned. Wait and watch from the shadows to observe enemy patrol patterns, gang composition and any environmental objects that you might be able to use to your advantage.<h3>NO PLAN SURVIVES FIRST CONTACT</h3>When it all kicks off you're going to have to think on your feet and coordinate with your partners. Just try to make sure you take out more bad guys than other officers in the process!<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>A CITY RULED BY GANGS</h3>Three rival factions control the city. The Fogtoof Boyz, an Orc gang with a reputation for violence and destruction. The Commision, a band of rogue merchants whose lust for power put them on the wrong side of the law, and The Corpse Cult - an religious organization infecting the city by turning its followers into mindless zombies.<h3>FIND THE KINGPINS</h3>Each gang has a kingpin. Take out the kingpin, you take out the gang. You will have to work your way up the food chain in order to find the kingpins location and assault their hideout.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T09:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c96/c96a4bbfc318fb3b1127a39c2407c26e.jpg", "website": "https://guards.cool", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WYLDERZONE", "Lowkey GameDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WYLDERZONE"], "esrb_rating": null}
