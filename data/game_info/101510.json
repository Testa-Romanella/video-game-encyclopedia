No, it's time for <strong><em>3D Platformer Maker</em></strong>!</p>\n<p><em><strong>3D Platformer Maker</strong></em> allows you to make your own platformer level via intuitive interface - no coding or 3d modeling skills required - and it is open source!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can make a stair or a long line of 100 spheres easily by using\u00a0<strong>offset\u00a0</strong>when adding objects (just type \"100\" in \"x\" field and click once to make 100 objects). New object also preserves the <strong>rotation</strong>, <strong>scale </strong>and <strong>color </strong>of selected one.</p>\n<p>After hard work of making a giant castle, tower, pool, car or an impossible level that only you can finish you can <strong>save </strong>it and send to your friends. Can they beat your level?</p>\n<p>And with <strong>3PM Importer for Unity</strong> you can import your creation into Unity with all scripts attached (player movement, camera controller, spawners). You'll just need to replace debug messages when level finishes or player falls. Now you can publish it as your own game!</p>\r\nObjectCan be a spawner? *CubeYes!SphereYes!CapsuleYes!CylinderYes!PlaneNo :(QuadNo :(\r\n<p>* Each object can spawn up to 10 clones, any extra will scale down and disappear (oldest first). This is done only to improve performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Input</strong>\u00a0<strong>in Play mode:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>W</strong>, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, or<strong> arrow keys</strong> to move **</li><li><strong>Space</strong> to jump</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Input in Edit mode:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>W</strong>,\u00a0<strong>A</strong>,\u00a0<strong>S</strong>,\u00a0<strong>D</strong>, or<strong>\u00a0arrow keys</strong>\u00a0to move camera **</li><li><strong>Mouse wheel</strong> to zoom</li><li><strong>DEL </strong>to delete selected object</li></ul>\n<p><strong>General Input:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Shift\u00a0+ Esc</strong> to quit <strong><em>(remember to save your work before quitting!)</em></strong></li><li><strong>F5</strong> to switch edit/play mode</li></ul>\n<p><strong>**</strong> This input can be modified when launching 3PM.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro-tip: </strong>Click on object name when player or finish is selected, and its top will be selected!
