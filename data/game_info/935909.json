My strongpoint is making art, I am not great at coding yet. Feedback is welcome.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Rat &amp; Ruin </strong>is\u00a0to be a puzzle platformer with a light story sprinkled on top. Without spoiling the plot, it is about a Rat explorer who is searching for something in an abandoned world. He has to scour deserted tombs and ruins to collect the Big Key to open the Big Door to each next stage. Along the way he will collect loot for points, solve light puzzles, do some platforming and uncover bits of the story.\u00a0</p>\r\nAlpha Demo (feedback welcome)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>I am putting my first version of Rat &amp;\u00a0Ruin on Itch.io to get feedback on the player controls and other aspects of the game. I'll be regularly posting new versions and dev logs.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Style of This Game:\u00a0</strong>The vibe for this game is to be a little \"slower\" than most action platformers which have dashes and a lot of action happening. This platformer will have some story elements sprinkled throughout and its ok if its a bit slower. It's not totally about \"skill\" but more about finding the Key, grabbing coins and having a chill time.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>WASD keys to move and jump.\u00a0</li><li>SPACE BAR to open chests and activate doors.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T18:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/915/9155e43029f70d0b1076fcdee43db1fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pixel Basement"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
