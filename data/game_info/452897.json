{"id": 452897, "slug": "cave-rocket", "name": "Cave Rocket", "name_original": "Cave Rocket", "description": "<p><strong>Description<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Cave Rocket is a simple gravity based simulator. You control a small ship to fly through the\u00a0procedurally generated caves. The more you advance - the more difficult the caves become. Once you finish the last level you'll have a chance to infinitely continue your journey with next caves becoming longer and longer, but to compensate that you'll be awarded additional lives from time to time.<br/></p>\n<p>You may also want to unlock some achievements which are currently 8 in the game with 1 being secret (you only know it's title, but don't know the conditions).</p>\n<p><strong>Current status and plans for future</strong></p>\n<p>It is in some sort of \"beta\" now hopefully being stable. Currently only Windows build is available, but I hope to get it built for Mac and Linux soon. Web build is currently impossible unfortunately due to some bugs in Game Maker Studuio 2 itself. But as soon as they are fixed - hope to also build for HTML.</p>\n<p>Though the game is functionally ready, I may add some new features to it later. Probably some statistics to track your time/progress spent in it. At maximum - more level variety or even new game modes, but that is not so likely. Who knows.</p>\n<p><strong>Donations are welcome!</strong></p>\n<p>This game is distibuted for free, but if you wish to support my further work and projects - I would highly appreciate any donations, that will help me a lot\u00a0during these difficult times of COVID-19.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Feel free to leave any comments regarding this game, especially if you find any bugs. It is always very pleasant to know what other people think about your work :)</p>\n<p><strong>Good luck to everyone and take care!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3af/3af233ab26f84e73eca42e5deff65aeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amegatron"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
