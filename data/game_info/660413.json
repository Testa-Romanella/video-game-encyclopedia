You are capable of making Yes/No choices. Now, after an unknown amount of time, you are reconnected to the Machine Network to once again make decisions, the outcomes of which  will shape the path your kind walks, so think very, very, <strong>very</strong> hard about your choices, if you can.</p>\n<p>= = = = = = = = = =<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in <strong><em>3 weeks</em></strong> from start to finish as an entry into the NieR:Re[in]carnation Content Creator competition. As such, it is sure to be a little rough around the edges here and there, so let me know if you find any crazy bugs!
