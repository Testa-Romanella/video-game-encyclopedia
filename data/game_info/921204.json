Be careful there's a cooldown on that (check the UI to see the CD). To destroy those evil numbers swipe and click with the mouse - as soon as you get it, it's oddly satisfying haha.</p>\n<p>As soon as you reach the next level you receive a kader of power ups you can choose from! Choose wisely my friends!</p>\n<p><strong>What's the goal?</strong></p>\n<p>Survive. As. Long. As. Possible. - You'll receive a grade after you die!
