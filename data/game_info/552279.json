For this game, what is less for one player is more for the other. You can help your ally by taunting more monsters to attack you instead of them, and there is only one hammer that needs to be shared between the two players.</p>\n<p>Programming and sound was done by <strong>Vykri</strong> and most art was done by <strong>Bloodinia</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you're having any issues with the game connecting, try using Chrome.
