The only problem is they have a really short life span....like\u00a0<em>really</em> short! Croaked is a fast paced arcade game in which you help a new settlement of toads make a forest home. Collect and bring back the various items required by sending out a new toad every 20 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Movement - WASD</p>\n<p>Pick Up/Drop Object - Left Click</p>\n<p>Exit Game - Escape</p>\n<p><strong>Game\u00a0Jam</strong></p>\n<p>Croaked was made for<strong> Ostara: Games for Spring 2021</strong> Game Jam. The theme for this game jam was:\u00a0<strong>After This: We Regrow</strong>. The toads in Croaked are starting from scratch and it will take a lot of work to get the place to their liking so that they can one day\u00a0<em>grow</em> again.</p>\n<p>This game jam also came with additional modifiers to challenge and inspire games. I tried my best to incorporate a few of these \"growth modifiers.\"\u00a0<strong>Intergenerational</strong> required a player to leave something behind in game that effects the next playthrough. When a toad's time is up, the player restarts in the center of the level, but the progress from previous toad attempts is saved. The locations of any dropped items is also kept. A strategic toad might work to get as many objects close to the center as possible for cashing in!\u00a0<strong>Down to Earth</strong> required no verticality in the game. I managed to do so by keeping the world flat but using a shader to bend and warp the world to keep visual interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music Used:</p>\n<p>StupidBlues2 by Tozan using the CC0 License</p>\n<p>Weird Boss Music 2 by\u00a0GoatBoy\u00a0using the CC-BY 3.0 License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T05:41:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a7ba06a43b32f6a8ca233d753e6b247.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["tonicwater"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
