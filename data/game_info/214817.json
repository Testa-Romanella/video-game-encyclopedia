This game was inspired by a tutorial project I completed in game maker, a game called \"Lazarus\". I'll admit that completing a puzzle platformer in game maker was way easier than unity, especially when all the sprites and animations were provided\u00a0in the tutorial files. This jam was a blast, feel free to rate my game honestly. It doesn't have the polish that many other games do.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>Controls:</em></strong><br/>\r\nMove Character - A and D <br/>\r\nPause - Escape <br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Source On Github</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6e/e6e4a6ba4b7c9528bedc2d4fb9a57216.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tanman555"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
