{"id": 406054, "slug": "the-beach", "name": "The Beach", "name_original": "The Beach", "description": "<p><strong>THE BEACH</strong> is the first <strong>ENDLESS\u00a0BATTLE ROYALE</strong> game for 60 (80? 100?)\u00a0players where you play as a hapless seagull trying to avoid a relentless wave and other obstacles to survive longer than any other player!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE BEACH</strong> is an endless battle royale game, which means that you not only want to survive the longest, but if you die, the leader rotates to the next person in line. It's your job then to survive for as long as possible!</p>\n<p>To do that, your main priority\u00a0is to <strong>AVOID THE WAVE</strong>. If you touch the wave you'll <strong>POOF</strong>! This clears all your gold and leaderboard status, so you'll have to start over from 0.</p>\n<p>It would be easy if you could just avoid the wave forever, but to get on the leaderboard you need to <strong>DIG UP GOLD</strong>. There's more gold the closer you are to the wave, so you'll want to push far out to grab gold, but don't overextend so you don't get <strong>POOFED</strong>!</p>\n<p>At your disposal as well are <strong>ITEMS</strong> that you can use for gold to mess with other players! The <strong>BOTTLE </strong>blocks a players movement, and the <strong>BREAD </strong>sucks seagulls to it (because seagulls love bread). Spending money to spawn these items doesn't deduct from your leaderboard score, so feel free to use items like crazy!</p>\n\n<p>We highly recommend the game be played with an Xbox controller on a PC, but we also support both Keyboard-centric and Mouse+Keyboard-centric control schemes:</p>\n<p><strong>Move:</strong> WASD | Arrow Keys | Left Stick<br/><strong>Sprint:</strong> Left/Right Shift | Right Trigger<br/><strong>Dig Ground: </strong>Left Click | C | B Button<br/><strong>Change Selected Item:</strong> Q/E |\u00a0Left/Right Bumper | Scroll Wheel<br/><strong>Spawn Item:</strong> Right Click | F | X Button<br/><strong>Options:</strong> Esc Key</p>\n<p>You can also view controls in the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE BEACH</strong> is currently in an alpha state! It's working, but has some obvious bugs and places where we could improve. In fact, there's a ton of stuff we want to add to the game (more items, cosmetics, persistent leaderboards, etc.) but want to hear from people who are playing it where we should best focus our efforts!</p>\n<p>So please reach out through either the comments below, our Twitter account, or our email to let us know what you think!</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Kyle Kukshtel</strong>, Designer/Programmer<br/><strong>Kevin Waters</strong>, Designer/Programmer<br/><strong>Emily Grimaldi</strong>, Artist</p>\n<p>Thanks also to Max from Normal VR/Normcore for helping us debug!</p>\n<p>Twitter: <strong>@thebeachgame</strong><br/>Email: <strong>thebeach@afterschool.studio</strong></p>\n<p>Song is\u00a0The Beach (Apoxode Mix) by Apoxode</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:07:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eec/eec2a5294713cdb3d47060a9b8f79c56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["afterschool"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
