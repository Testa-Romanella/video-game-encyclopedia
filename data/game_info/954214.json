Then move your mouse to where you want your tower. If the tower is red, you can't place it there. When your mouse is where you want the tower, and the tower is not red, click again to place it. Press the \"Towers\" button to show and hide the tower shop.</p>\n<p>Tip: After awhile of shooting, not actively playing the game\u00a0, or lag, a tower will stop shooting (IDK why). Simply sell it by pressing Q while touching it with your\u00a0mouse will give you a full money back guarantee.</p>\n<p>Tip: If you clicked a tower, but don't want to place it, press Z on your keyboard to sell it without placing it.</p>\n<p>First off, no tower aims toward enemies, so you need to know what each tower does, what you can change about them, and the best spots to place them. I will leave that last one to you. ;)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use the glue trap to slow down enemies. It unlocks after beating wave 6 And costs 8$ per trap. It can only be placed on paths.</p>\n<p>The first tower, the spinny tower, spins. It costs 30$. Once placed, it can be changed to start spinning the other direction.</p>\n<p>The second tower, the Aiming tower, Points towards your mouse. It costs 60$ and is unlocked after beating wave 3. Once Placed, it can be changed to stop it from pointing at the mouse, and just fire in that direction. Change it again to get it to point at your mouse again.</p>\n<p>The third tower, the splitter tower, quickly shoots bullets in four different directions. It also costs 60$ and is unlocked after wave 9. Once placed, it can be changed to switch between shooting Straight and diagonal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 15 Waves for now, I will add more later.</p>\n<p>Find a bug? Tell me in the comments and I will try to fix it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T06:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/247/247518252d495849375c9696044c17b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheNetherKing"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
