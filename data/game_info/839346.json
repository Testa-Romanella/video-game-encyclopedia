Any suggestions for content would be appreciated as well since this didn't ever have any plans. It was more of a small game that meant to have a very tiny scope and it will stay that way. However only having one or two enemies is a little\u00a0<em>too</em> small in my opinion.</p>\n<p>Anyways,<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for checking this out! It means a lot and I hope you enjoy this work in progress game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T06:54:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f62/f6226a59d2d1ddfc890c0174ff76d1f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GudBoiNero"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
