Together, they have to complete tasks that keep the spacecraft running smoothly. However, soon after take-off, a loud thud sounds on the hull, and they find a crewmate half-eaten. The remaining crewmates group up and look for an alien that might've snuck onboard. While they're searching, the alien eats two more crewmates and hijacks one of their bodies, becoming an impostor among them. When the crewmates discover and report another body, they become suspicious of each other and don't know who to trust anymore. Different functions on the ship continue to suspiciously malfunction, and more crewmates suddenly drop dead. The real crewmates must look for clues to find out who the imposter is and eliminate them before it's too late.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:43:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94f/94fb7ea9419f82b4624da40cfbfb5c8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["annao"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
