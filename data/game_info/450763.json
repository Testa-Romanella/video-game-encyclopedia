Thought I'd post it to see what everyone thinks.</p>\n<p>It's a short trail game based on the WW2 Operation Market-Garden. You play as a tank crew of the XXX corps that must travel the 64 miles to Arnhem to reinforce the paratroopers who landed there. It's not a long distance, but supplies will be short and logistics will be bad and of course, you're in a slow a** tank traveling through a warzone. It's not a glamorous adventure, but it's one your virtual tank crew will no doubt remember forever (or would, if they were sentient).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hopefully you guys enjoy and it's not too glitchy lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:17:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f42/f42566e8bc00f94aea7118fc2feaeb38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Venerable"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
