Try not to wreck or your score will reset to 0!<br/></p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for white Healing Lights and yellow Speed Lights, too!</p>\n<p>Made in less than 24 hours in Construct 2, Photoshop CC, FL Studio 12, and some BFXR. </p>\r\nDevelopment On Hold: Seeing as this page still gets some decent traffic, we are exploring the option of expanding upon this game. To avoid confusion in the marketplace with Hyper Light Drifter, the name of the final product will be changed to something more discernable. In the meantime, keep playing the LD34 version of the game and visit our official website to keep tabs on resumed development.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b226aedf3716e8a97fa2cd5447e83a0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thought Reactor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
