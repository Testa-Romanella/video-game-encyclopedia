It's a top down adventure game full of references to some teachers and classmates from my high school, so the game has a pretty limited audience.</p>\n<p>I used and downloaded a lot of sounds from other video games (mainly Zelda) and also royalty free sounds, but I made my own music using a software called LMMS, and used minimal, if any, drag'n'drop features, because I believe that's what HeartBeast\u00a0advised.</p>\n<p>The game is called \"Title\" because I was running out of time at the end of the school year and never could come up with a name for the game, so it remained \"Title\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T10:38:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1d/e1d772f347d064838e789cffac723583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aptBenj"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
