If you cannot build on a tile, the border of the <strong>buildable</strong> area is shown on screen.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are two types of resources: You see three <strong>building materials</strong>  at the top of the screen: metal, oil, and science juice. You need to  spend these as a one-time cost to build on tiles, but mining buildings  will also generate some resources (but they cost you space). \r\n</p>\n<p>The other kind of \u201cresource\u201d is <strong>products</strong>  of tiles that power settlements. They exist on the map, and depend on  the current tile configuration. They cannot be saved for later. To  sustain a population of N in a settlement, you need at least N energy, N  food, and N Oxygen from adjacent tiles. The output of some tiles  depends on its adjacent tiles.\r\n</p>\n<p>A settlement with N people allows  you to build inside an N-tile radius, up to 3. If you hover over a  settlement, you see the population of the settlement, the building  radius, and the products of adjacent tiles it can use. If the output of  adjacent decreases, the population and building radius can shrink, but  existing built structures outside the radius will stay in place. The  goal is to have a <strong>population of 25</strong> or more people over all settlements.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:14:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/6934f3c775ce103cbddb242504a9a189.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blubberquark Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
