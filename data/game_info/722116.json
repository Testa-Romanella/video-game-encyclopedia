This means that there will be NO official sequels to this game, unless I have a really good reason to make a sequel. A story expansion one day, maybe. But not right now.--</p>\n<p>\"Baldimore is still missing, and at large. He was the one responsible for the slaughter of 17 children on June 17, 1997. If anyone has any information regarding the current location of Baldimore, please be advised that there is still a $2,000 incentive for calling the South Cove police department with proper information. If found, he will surely be given capital punishment as soon as legally possible.\" -South Cove Local News; South Cove, Virginia.\r\n</p>\n<p>It's only one day before your partner tips the location of Baldimore, in effort to properly claim the tip reward in the event that your plan fails. Before sunrise, you must put Baldimore down for good in the way you know he anticipated. Or else the law will do it for you instead, and you'll probably go down with him. It's time for Baldimore's reign to end, once and for all.\r\n</p>\n<p>~This project is a mix between a Five Nights at Freddy's fan game &amp; a Baldi's Basics horror-like interpretation.~\r\n</p>\n<p>-Note that the story of this game is my interpretation of a horror version of Baldi's Basics, and character designs/locations are likely going to be different from the original Baldi's Basics. I've taken some specific liberties to change specific characters from their original canon in Baldi's Basics. (This is based on the ORIGINAL Baldi's Basics; the classic versions to be specific.)-\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:37:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7cfaa4b730bfba7ab01562e8004e473.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YORTUSIN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
