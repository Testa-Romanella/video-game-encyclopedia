Crazy, right?  This dress up game allows you to finally create your own magical character, based on a precious stone of choice!<br/><br/>Choose from a dazzling array of both clear and solid gemstones from throughout the universe. Customize the body of your gemsona intricately, down to each individual part! Dress her in an original and ornate outfit which reflects her position in the hierarchy.<br/><br/>The kicker? Once you are finished your character, you can add more characters and FUSE them together to see what their fusion would look like!<br/><br/>Drag and drop infinite characters onto the scene, choose backgrounds, dress up new characters and more!  I hope you enjoy this unofficial ode to a universal theme.<br/><br/>~OLa", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T10:33:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/8542116dfdd87573a6e70cb49d839827.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Doll Divine Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Doll Divine Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
