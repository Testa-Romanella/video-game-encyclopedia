The first few levels of the game will make you feel like the game is just an eerie maze. 2 level(s) are currently built, but only 1 is available as of version alpha 0.10. The game developed is in spare time though updated come out regularly. I do not want donations so they are turned off.</p>\n<p>Please leave feedback it is much appreciated, this is my first <strong>Unity</strong> game and <strong>all</strong> feedback is helpful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93c/93c864e3417a2aa2db03223ea8c92ca3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SnekySpider"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
