Unlike traditional rhythm games, the player plays the music instead of playing a pattern while music plays in the background.\u00a0 Different music is procedurally\u00a0generated using rules of composition\u00a0depending on the enemy encountered. In addition, gain new synthesizers and musical key signatures throughout your journey! If you like osu, you probably will enjoy this game.</p>\n<p>Bearly Dancing features an adaptable, scaling difficulty system that will pose a challenge to anyone without feeling overwhelmingly difficult. Play music, meet quirky characters, find secrets, and have fun!</p>\n<p>Currently, there is only a demo of the game. Bearly Dancing is set to release in about a year. Support the developer by playing the demo and following the project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/726/726f05032db4734d5962e86b8717339d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["oliver"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
