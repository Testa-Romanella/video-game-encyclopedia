Basically you press your key either A or L to deflect the ball using your shield, if the ball collides with your paddle you lose! The ball speeds up to put your reflex skills to the test. May update in the future to add more to it but it was just something small I wanted to make.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3e/f3e897e7b5cce7fa30d27204afc74109.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["0Bennyman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
