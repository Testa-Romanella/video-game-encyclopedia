This game is basically snake.\u00a0 BUUUT it's entirely rendered in a Console application using ASCII characters. It also features two Powerups, one of which is hard to spot, and Enemies that chase you. You, playing as snek, can only see things close to you, as the flashlight that you have on your head doesn't exactly shine very brightly. Goal of the Game? Why, of course it's getting as many points as you can, and maybe, if you feel funky you can compete against your friends too!\u00a0</p><p>Please leave realistic suggestions if you have any!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:06:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/951/951877b742b08f087c36ae0aeb9e0e52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["domjae"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
