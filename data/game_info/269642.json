This is the concept of this physics game, but in the end it's not that simple.<br/>Choose the right position for each block so that they don't fall down. If you've stacked all blocks in a save position the next level <br/><br/>gets unlocked. Every level has different blocks and needs another tactic to be solved.<br/>The higher the level the trickier it gets.<br/><br/>Have fun with BlockStacker!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d738595731734c6b2397efc33c1ac1bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["C-Apps"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Christian Wehr"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
