The WiiWare game features ten never-before-seen \n      single-player and multiplayer variations of Tetris, including Field \n      Climber, Stage Racer, Shadow, and Wii Balance Board-enabled modes. \n      Several of the modes give users the chance to take advantage of the \n      unique point-and-shoot capabilities of the Wii Remote controller. The \n      party doesn't stop there, though!\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
