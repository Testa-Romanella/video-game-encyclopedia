As a result it has a much smoother flow than usual, and convinced me that in future versions there should be a health bar to keep momentum. There is also no friendly fire, and although I considered giving an option where you could kill the other person on your team, I decided against it. I also wish I\u2019d included a tournament mode, so up to 16 players could enter, and then they\u2019d be played off against each, either 1 vs 1, or 2 vs 2, until the grand final, since I recal really enjoying the tournament modes in Super Street Fighter II.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I\u2019ve never been able to find three other people willing to play it, so I\u2019m not really sure how well it all works. Based on my solo attempts, I\u2019d say there\u2019s probably quite a few bugs still. Anyway, it should hopefully give you an impression of the potential TG had. The story was inspired an indie game competition some time back, where you needed to create a game featuring zombies, ninjas, pirates and robots \u2013 I typed it up in English, then ran it through Babelfish\u2019s language translation a few times, into Japanese and Chinese before back into English, then tweaked the spelling to be reminiscent of old arcade games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:35:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b66391087f020f39090b01ae8ff7edc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SZCZ GAMES"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
