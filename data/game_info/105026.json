You play a character who is searching an old temple for artifacts, however, you find something unexpected at the end...</p>\n<p>This game supports USB controllers!</p>\n<p>    In Artifact Hunter you collect artifacts that give you special powers(like speed boosts or slowing down time)! The gameplay is level based with \"checkpoints\" and new stuff every now and then. One of the unique things about Artifact Hunter, is that you have to figure out what different artifacts do. You must also figure out various ways to make use of multiple artifacts at once. Another thing you must figure out, is how the various hazards work!</p><p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>While a level may take around 30 seconds to 2 minutes to beat, the game should take an average of 2 to 4 hours to beat if you are a new player.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e38/e3812d0e18d6637e685cfae3c0d6db4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaFluffyPotato"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
