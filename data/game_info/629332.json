Or a touchscreen, if you're fancy.</p>\n<p>Pop the volleyballs, which can be easily punctured by your unicorn's pointy horn!</p>\n<p>Avoid the magic 8-balls, which will snap off your unicorn's horn like a twig!</p>\n<p>And for some reason your unicorn will spontaneously combust if it goes too far to the edges of the screen.</p>\n<p>This game doesn't contain any pancakes, thoughtful or otherwise, making it suitable for vegans and the gluten-intolerant alike.</p>\r\nLeaderboard\r\n<p>Behold... the leaderboard! This should update with any new scores. If you've just achieved a score, try refreshing the page and watch your name appear to the world!</p>\n<p>Entries may be removed for any reason, but the obvious ones are if an offensive/abusive name is used or the score is clearly cheated.</p>\r\n(open leaderboard in new tab)\r\nSources\r\n<p>As usual, I\u00a0didn't make anything myself.
