Sounds good, right? Well we really didn't think about it very much. The problem with this is the only way we could make this fun is to add way more complexity. Oh well, I'm happy with this.</p>\n\n<p>The game is about a game developer trying to make a game but facing all the struggles. It's really hard to understand the story but im happy with the execution, just think the idea is flawed.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:01:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51d2fe9ef49191c016ed4e3d0d759a1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Staber", "Living In Code"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
