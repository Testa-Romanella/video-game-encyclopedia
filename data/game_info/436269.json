Until that day comes, this gig is a part-time labour of love for me, so any donations are greatly\u00a0welcomed. You can do this by clicking the Support this Game button underneath the game window.</p>\n<p>The game is free to download and distribute. In fact, I encourage it. Tell your friends!</p>\n\n<ul><li>FUTURE UPDATES</li></ul>\n<p>This game is currently in development and will be updated regularly, so do check back.<br/></p>\n<p>v0.2 plans:</p>\n<p>- Implement a score system and hi-score table. Incrementing points for goblins knocked down in one shot.</p>\n<p>- More goblin types. Currently there's only Snatchers. I'm planning to introduce Grapplers in the next version; goblins that are able to grab and throw the player.</p>\n<p>-Fouls. A referee goblin will be introduced that will stop the game with a penalty if the player either a) Knocks down the wench with a goblin or b) Tries to pick her up.</p>\n\n<ul><li>CONTACT</li></ul>\n<p>I'd love to hear any feedback, suggestions and bug reports. I can be contacted right here on itch, or on my twitter @hairy_viking</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T02:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8a/f8a3c1e33bd598021548be84b451b582.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["HairyViking"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
