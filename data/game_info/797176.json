The theme was \"<strong><em>Death is Only The Beginning</em></strong>\". It was our first game jam and we enjoyed developing the prototype. Enjoy and leave us some comments. As of the first upload of the game, there are multiple animations that aren't finished, audio SFX that haven't been implemented and there\u00a0may be some minor non-game-breaking bugs.</p>\n<p>Team:<br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Programmed By: Dave Evans</li>\n<li>Art By: Chris Nace &amp; Dave Evans</li>\n<li>SFX By: Keith Chalkey &amp; Dave Evans</li>\n<li>Music By: Daniel Guerrera</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T18:38:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e3a01a4e85ff6bc8a55fc60e1001d37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["804 Game Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
