At the beginning of the week I thought I would try and make a Nidhogg style game. On paper it seems super simple but this game a week challenge makes you realize how much work goes into even the simplest concepts.</p><p>So instead of doing it in a really hacky way (having an two separate objects for player specific swords) I wanted to make the sword a generic object that the players spawn. I got player movement and sword stances working ok but could just not get players to die when they came into contact with an instance of a sword other than their own.</p><p>I think I had every other possible combination of outcomes but just ran out of time in the end. It feels like I've hit a bit of a plateau / wall with game maker. It's getting to the stage where I need to invest some time doing some tutorials to get to grips with the more advanced functions. On the plus side I feel like I've got the hang of creating instances of objects and assigning them the ID's of their owners.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/816dc35137067f714ca02975848c379c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HK UdP"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
