The best way to show what is does was to actually make a mini-game with it!</p>\n<p>This demo demonstrates that you can split rooms into individual scenes and still have your player moving freely between them like they were all part of the same area. Information can also be \"remembered\" by a room once it is unloaded/reloaded, and\u00a0communication can also occur accros different rooms.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T19:09:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e56/e56597a74ce1326a6b5893435ff3c162.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperValou"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
