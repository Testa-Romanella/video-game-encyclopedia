This means it has a lot of stupid stuff in it. Playthrough should take at least 1 hour and 45 minutes to 100% if you know exactly what you're doing. Free, because it uses some of the default RPG Maker assets and assets from Nintendo. So I can't sell anything.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/610/6104c2254309dbac8263fa38bc4e2543.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RTYG Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
