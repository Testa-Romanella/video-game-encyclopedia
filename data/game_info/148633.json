The 'studio' consists of myself, my brother (artist) and our buddy (musician). We're all self-taught in our fields (which means we fly by the seat of our pants and make mistakes often), have full-time jobs, and love video games enough to spend a significant amount of our free time making and/or playing them.<br/><br/>Loot Run is our current project and it's been in the works for a few years now.<br/><br/>We've created a linear RPG where you'll experience the core story while building a custom skill set and understanding of the game mechanics. Game mechanics are deceptively complex. It's a runner, so movement is limited to avoiding obstacles. The player assigns 6 skills to the skill bar (from a total of 36 unlockable) all with different synergies, strengths and weaknesses. Combat is one enemy at a time and fast paced. Some skills require a high skill cap, some are more spammable, and they all work differently together. The depth of Loot Run lies with the player's skill choices, specialization choices, and gear selection.</p>\n<p>If you like Loot Run, join our Discord Server!\u00a0 We use it for meetings (you can listen in), and take our closed beta testers for new games from the channel.\u00a0 We also have Key giveaways from time to time!</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/sPvttF<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a0520597916df8f45db9b44df8a21b79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ThreeGuysGameStudio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
