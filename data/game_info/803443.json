But don't worry, you don't have to play that one to understand this one.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Guy and Alma have decided to take the overworked Clerk of the store on an adventure to show him that there are more things in life than his job. After travelling through a mysterious forest and meeting a witch from the distant past they find an impossibly large mall and decide to explore. But of course, things don't go quite as planned as the mall reveals its sinister side.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>It's an RPG with strategic combat and a very unique world filled with strange characters.
