P. Lovecraft comes the first adventure in the Evilibrium Universe. The game invites you to an alternate reality at the end of the 19th century, full of adventure, mystics, horrific creatures, dark rituals, and secret cults. In this world, souls are real and sufficient material to be extracted and used as a source of energy. Souls are therefore a hard-to-get and expensive merchandise that many desire.<br/><br/>Strange hostile creatures from parallel worlds lurk in murky forests and deep dungeons. You play a member of the Brotherhood of Hunters, adventurous people who hunt these monsters and catch their souls.
