{"id": 851745, "slug": "schulz-wachtmeister-demo", "name": "Schulz & Wachtmeister (demo)", "name_original": "Schulz & Wachtmeister (demo)", "description": "<p>World War One is raging. Two stragglers make their way through the alps, seeking shelter in an abandoned house. The player controls Wachtmeister, a less-than-competent officer, as he attempts to get along with Schulz, his sergeant, and sole remainder of their squad. Depending on how far the player takes them, the two can fight, bicker, and even kiss.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is focused on storytelling. The short, self-contained story is revealed through a mix of internal narration and flashbacks that appear as the player interacts with objects found in two stories of the house. Each time the player plays through the story, a different ending can be achieved from the prior play-through. The mood is somber and wistful. Full colour illustrations will feature, alongside a number of specific, artist-drawn expressions for each character.  This game is a single-player, top-down RPG built using RPGmaker MZ. It will be commercial. Sprites conveying facial expressions are currently placeholders, and will be swapped out in future builds. Estimated release date is Q4 2022.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T15:49:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1d/c1d9812d627dce882dfc8c1129aa7095.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tristan de l'Arkadien"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
