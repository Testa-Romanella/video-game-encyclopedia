Outworld Battlegrounds is a fast paced, 2D, top-down, battle royale shooter. Start with nothing but your trusty knife and hope you find something with a bit more of a plasma punch.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOutworld Battlegrounds is the first time a top-down battle royale game has been done right thanks to its tension building vision system. Like most top-down games the environment around the player is totally visible however, any player or dynamic object that would otherwise be hidden from your direct line of sight is not. This allows for the kind of paranoia a battle royale game should produce.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f5/5f55c7ae0293a09626fbb4b7934a361a.jpg", "website": "http://www.outworldbattlegrounds.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["HitGrab Game Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HitGrab Game Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
