Enter the world as Lira, a bounty hunter who was cursed with \"necrolepsy\". This makes the user fall asleep constantly, constantly have nightmares, and the nightmares become a reality! As such, Lira has to fight through this dastardly group of necromancers that cursed her! Using powers she's gained from the journey, join Lira as she slashes through the Necromancers that cursed her!</p>\n<p>Jump through mystical lands, juggle enemies as if they were toys, find hidden upgrades! So much to see and do as you blast through the world of Necrolepsy!</p>\n<p>This game was mostly made by one person, with help from contractors for music and additional art, so this is quite a bit of a passion project too. I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14b/14b53e0120795f9d8c381db3d1c78c31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stolken"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
