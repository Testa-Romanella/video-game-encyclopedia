One day some vile butchers and their trained weapons of war are suddenly detected coming your way, probably to steal all of your Power Chickens. You of course have some defensive measures up your long light purple sleeves. A musket wielding automaton and a self-manning cannon are what you have at your disposal. Summoning them is the easy part, but they require magic power. You have a magical aura around you naturally, but you can also imbue some of your Power Chickens with a portion of it and send them out to power your summoned weapons while you are elsewhere. <strong>Look for the enemy, setup defenses and supply them magic! Do not forget to power your towers or they will do nothing!</strong><br/></p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>W, A, S, D - Move the flying wizard around</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Create a Power Chicken and it will fly to the mouse location<br/></p>\n<p>Q - Recall all Power Chickens<br/></p>\n<p>Power Chickens can be controlled by selecting with left click and right clicking where you want them to go, like a MOBA or RTS<br/></p>\n<p>Left-click icon or 1, 2, 3 - Select Towers or Sell Towers<br/></p>\n<p>Left-click to place tower</p>\n<p>E - Toggle visibility of magic aura<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Key Up/Down - VOLUME Up/Down</strong><br/></p>\r\nTEAM\r\n<p>Design, Programming, Sound - Rufflesworth</p>\n<p>Art - Isaac M, John P<br/></p>\n\n<p>ALL HAIL THE POWER CHICKENS!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:58:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/896/8963e1dfccd4bfe16df7cb3059f43064.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rufflesworth"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
