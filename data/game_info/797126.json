Activated nodes will attempt to activate their neighboring nodes. Nodes can only become activated when they have less than 2 non-activated neighbors.\r\nThe answer is based on the game's internal algorithm which was discovers the minimum required starting points for each level.\r\n\r\nBackround:\r\nThe game was originally developed as testing ground for the node solving algorithm, but once the algorithm became reliable and efficient it was possible to build a full puzzle game out of it.
