Every platform you land on gives you 1 point, the more platforms you land on the more points you get. When there are 9 seconds left you gain extra speed and you can catch the last colors.</p>\n\r\nBest Experience\r\n<p>For the best experience download the game on your computer and use a controller or gamepad. This is the intended way to play the game, as I have been testing the game this way. Please note that the web version is not functioning correctly so if you want to play the game with the least amount of bugs please download the Windows version of the game, and play it that way. I have not tested the Linux or macOS versions yet but please let me know if they don't work.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A: Move left</p>\n<p>D: Move Right</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Controller/Gamepad:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left Joystick To Left: Move left</p>\n<p>Left Joystick To Right: Move Right</p>\n<p>A(Xbox), X(Playstation) South Button(Other): Jump</p>\n\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>Hope you enjoy it and if you can\u00a0give please give me some feedback as you can. I don't think I will continue on this game but the feedback would help me improve in the future. Please give\u00a0constructive feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Here's is a list of\u00a0 bugs I know about:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Jumping right before you hit a platform makes you jump, you don't get the point before you fall and land on it again.</li><li>If you click outside the buttons in any of the menus you cant go back to the controller/gamepad. There is a fix, you can hold down click on a button then move the controller/gamepad joystick down or up then drag the mouse out of the button.</li><li>In the web version, the controller/gamepad sometimes doesn't work and you can only use the D-pad to navigate in the menus.</li><li>In the web version, the controller/gamepad haptics/vibrations don't work.</li><li>In the web version, it's hard to hear the clock ticking down after you have reached 10 seconds.</li></ul>\n<p>Made and developed by<strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>Bietlxn</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>for the<strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>One Minute Game Jam #5 2022</strong><strong>.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T06:09:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4abef0c480d3e5295084bf83fcc75409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["bietlxn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
