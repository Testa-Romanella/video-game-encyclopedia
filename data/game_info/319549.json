This demo includes a short tutorial that walks the player through mining and automating the bare essentials for surviving on a cold harsh planet! Art and models are completely lacking, but there is some limited amount of open-ended play available after the tutorial is completed. Prototyping the following systems were the primary focus:</p>\n<ul><li>Structure building</li><li>Factory machines and recipes</li><li>Machine plugin system</li><li>Inventory\u00a0item filtering</li><li>Conveyor and factory\u00a0automation</li><li>Tutorial missions</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T04:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/245/245143fa4e9301395440aee4ed24ceac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pilot Wave Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
