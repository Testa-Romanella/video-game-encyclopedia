But first! There's more delicious souls to harvest. Become the Overlord in this deckbuilding autobattler game where being evil never felt more satisfying - or been as fun.\u201d<br/></p>\n<p>Sarkos is a card based strategy game where you get to build your own dungeon and play as the bad guy. Your goal is to defeat the parodic heroes who have traveled the world to fight you. With their poor human souls as a currency, you buy trap rooms and monsters to help you. There are plenty of room and monster cards to choose from and as you progress in the game, even more options reveal themselves. How you make the heroes suffer is up to you! Acid, explosions, blood sacrifice\u2026 or are you more of a gambler? Then maybe the Casino Room will be part of your favorite combo!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Team:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Albin Pettersson - Game Design <br/>Felix Sandegren - Game Design<br/>Clara Karlsson - Graphics <br/>Emmanuella Olomina - Graphics <br/>Katarina Andrijevic - Graphics <br/>Michael R\u00e5dstr\u00f6m - Game Writing <br/>Carl-Vilhelm Johansson - Programming <br/>Jesper Larsson - Programming <br/>Martin Weidenborn - Music <br/>Julia Siljebo - Sound Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T11:33:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93f/93fb7c109f7a51e81df19f55b6d0b383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LuckyThirteenGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
