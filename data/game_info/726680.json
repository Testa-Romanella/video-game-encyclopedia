In your possession are the ancient stones of the Eternal Ones - and with them the power to overthrow the Gods and eradicate all of creation!</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>50 Phase-Out sequences are all that stand between you and the end of the universe, your one and only chance to undo all the work of your ethereal oppressors and to rebuild the Cosmos to your own design...\"</em></p>\n<p>The 16k release of PHASE OUT was created for the RGCD C64 16k Cartridge Competition 2013. If you like puzzle based games where you need to match the colours, then this is the game for you. According to the developers the goal of the game is to clear each level by swapping the position of the coloured gems in 'match-2-or-more' style. But as there's always a twist, you'll have to deal with black gems which can't be cleared and non movable wall bricks.</p>\n<p>Phase Out has been tested on both PAL and NTSC machines, and works on the C64, C128 and C64GS (there is no keyboard input required to play). Although it runs on NTSC hardware, it does play fractionally faster and will be harder as a direct result of this. The downloadable disk image is also designed for direct execution\u00a0on TheC64Mini and TheC64Maxi.</p>\n<p><strong>This level pack edition (LPE) contains 50 more reloadable levels (level pack summer 2018)\u00a0on the disk image which can be loaded after finishing the last 50 previuos levels!!!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T07:04:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/108230e1a4a42b8e7dfd32af78410c70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["INC-X GDG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
