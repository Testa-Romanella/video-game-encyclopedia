The theme was \"Signs of Life\".</p>\n<p>In <em>Seeds of Life</em>, you have to grow a planet using seeds. While growing, plants will create new surfaces for you to cultivate. Be warned though, for if you don't water your plants properly (too few or too much water), they will struggle to grow.</p>\n<p>The more a plant grow, the more it consumes water. It is a challenge that will reward \u00a0you with new seeds\u00a0if you do a good job, meaning you can expend your planet even more.</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy <em>Seeds of Life</em> as I enjoyed making it. Stay tuned for further updates !<br/></p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\n<p>Mouse grab'n'drag to rotate the planet<br/>Mouse click for other actions.</p>\n<strong>Credits:</strong>\n<p>Game entirely made by Emmanuel BARREAU (@Kaihyo) in 48h.<br/>Watering can and seeds icon : Flaticon.com\r\n<br/>SFX: Zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:07:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/232/2322bcaa624f124380d6272b3d9f8c67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emmanuel Barreau"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
