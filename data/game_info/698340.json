Faint of heart beware. Don't play if you have health risks from being spooked. I know jump scares are cheap which is why The Ranger didn't have them, but this game does. *shrug*</p>\r\nWhat am I looking at?\r\n<p>This is a demo of a game I had been working on for the LSDJAM 2021\u00a0game jam. The goal was to make a game that's about dreams.</p>\n<p>I've basically put two of my dreams in the game, though only one world is truly finished. Here's what the progress on the levels was:<br/></p>\n<p>Coconut: 90%, mostly missing polish<br/>Coconut (bad dream): 30%<br/>House: 20%</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Explore dream environments that are largely based on actual dreams I had. Every dream (except the house) has a way to end it in a \"good\" way and a \"bad\" way. Ending the dream in a good way brings you to another good dream, ending it in a bad way sends you to a bad dream. Falling off the map is a way to trigger a bad dream, for example.</p>\n<p>There are only 3\u00a0levels with only 1\u00a0bad dream.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>W/A/S/D to move<br/>Shift to run<br/>C to crouch<br/>Left click to use<br/>ESC to open the menu where you can adjust mouse sensitivity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T07:15:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73d/73d06c3d3c6294a858032243ed60f91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
