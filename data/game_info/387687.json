Somewhere in his despicable experiments, he succeeded, stealing colour from the world and ending entire environments of life. He did; however, also manage to create life, in the form of our avatars, the Chromakins. They held all the colours of the world in their vessels, trapped as they were in his hellish laboratory.</p>\n<p>The Chromakins stayed for eons in their jar prisons until, finally, they broke out, searching desperately for answers. They came across a book, one which described a world rich and full with colour and life. Now they have decided to bring back colour to the world and have set out on their perilous journey to do exactly that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:41:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d9226f02337c0a69923e9da40854f3b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["studiokaboom"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
