Defeat your inner demons and discover the true meaning of love and friendship - or don't, if that's not your cup of tea. The game has four different endings, so the level of self-discovery is really up to you.</p>\n<p>\"The Bear Next Door\" is a weird-ish dark humor visual novel that takes about 20 minutes to play through. Pay what you want, or nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Questionable content?</strong></p>\n<p>Do you find muscular bodybuilder teddy bears slathered in oil titillating? If so, this game might be erotic to you. To normal people it's just somewhat eccentric, I guess. Also includes a few naughtily worded rhyming couplets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f45614267020f6a0182bdb911d756f02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Instant Million"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
