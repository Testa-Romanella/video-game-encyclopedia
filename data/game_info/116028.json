There will be many obstacles along the way, and only you have the power to help her go through them all!! </p>\r\nGeneral Details\r\n<p>- Use default RTP and some imported resources and scripts.<br/>- Full of puzzles. Most of them are <strong>\"extremely hard\"</strong> to solve. Be cautious...<br/>- Various ways to deal with things. Many choices for you to be chosen.<br/>- Multiple endings. 4 Bad Ends , 2 Neutral Ends and 1 Good End. Only a good end is canon. <br/><em>*(A \"<strong>Good End\"</strong> is <strong>\"extremely hard\"</strong> to get. It can be achieved in the first play-through technically. But not logically. It may required second or more time.
