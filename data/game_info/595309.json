{"id": 595309, "slug": "third-party-duckonaut", "name": "Third Party (Duckonaut)", "name_original": "Third Party (Duckonaut)", "description": "<p>Third Party is a top-down stealth game where you play as a spy tasked with stealing important data from a rivaling government. Your task would be easy enough if your objective wasn't in a underground top-secret facility\u00a0 handling an alien outbreak. No hallway or corridor is free from enemy presence, most ways of infiltration would end up with you 6 feet under, and both man and mutation want you dead. Luckily for you, your favorite movie is Weekend at Bernie's.<br/></p>\n<p>Descend deeper into the heart of the facility...\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Either through bullets or teeth, death is indiscriminate: you die in one hit. Use the fallen corpses of dead foes to traverse safely within enemy presence.</p>\n\n<p>Every enemy will shoot anything that moves that isn't of their color: make sure you bring the right corpse!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>EchoDuck/Duckonaut: Lead Dev, Programmer</li><li>Trensient: Artist, Programmer, Level Designer</li><li>Nomis: Lead Artist</li><li>OS: Programmer</li><li>Graydee: Programmer</li><li>Nao: Artist</li><li>pkpseudo: Lead Promo Design, Artist</li><li>Salvati: Music, Sound Design</li><li>egshels: \"emotional support\"</li><li>Oroshibu: noticing one wrong pixel</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD: move</li><li>Left Mouse Button: Shoot bullet</li><li>Right Mouse Button: Hold corpse</li><li>E: interact with elevators</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T13:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99c/99c40f08f368c3acb6baa9d2b9fdd151.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Duckonaut"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
