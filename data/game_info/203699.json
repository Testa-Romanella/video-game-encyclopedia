I also wanted to capture the feeling of getting to explore and expansive map and see it change over seasons, and as new villagers arrived.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately... It's kind of boring! There's way too much clicking involved. \u00a0Clicking to get resources, clicking to travel the map... And unlike most clicker games, there's not really an idle aspect to the game, which would allow the character to explore the world without losing out on building resources. It just wasn't very rewarding to me!</p>\n<p>Still, I have this prototype made, which has a few buildings put in, some crops that grow overtime, as well as a crude day/afternoon/night system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Check it out if you're interested!</p>\n<p>I'd like to revisit this idea in the future, but not likely with this game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b9/1b968453de899594a33265a7f3566195.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adoxographist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
