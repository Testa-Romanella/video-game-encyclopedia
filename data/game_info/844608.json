The intent was to play around with the new UE5 Geometry Scripting tool, and we decided on the idea of playing around with folding paper. The theme is \"As above, so below\", so this piece of paper is able to change into a piece of plastic and survive underwater. Benting capabilities also change depending on your material, and everything is procedurally computed using Geometry Scripting.</p>\n<p>We hope to be expanding the concept eventually, for now it's more of a proof of concept/tech demo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>F - Fold<br/>Keep Shift - Lie down<br/>WASD - Move<br/>Spacebar - Jump<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T07:09:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f94/f945e9e29b5898dca5a25e5ed535a862.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Renard's Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
