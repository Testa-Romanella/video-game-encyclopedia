With small adjustments you can create freezing iceworlds, blazing deserts or juicy grassplanes.</p><p>Place your tribe within this world. You can tweak the animal's properties and choose if you want some strong and aggressive animals or some quick and lightweight.</p><p>This is more a tech demo than a finished game, but the core mechanics are present.
