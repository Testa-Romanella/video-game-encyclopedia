The gameplay is much like a text adventure game; the screen shows a picture of the room the player is currently in and to the right is a description of the room. The description mentions any items that can be used or picked up, but to do that the player must click on the item in the picture. The pictures change as the player moves to a new scene. There is no movement in the picture, but enemies are inserted when encountered, accompanied by sound effects. The player can then choose from a drop down menu whether to flee, and which way (north, south, east or west and occasionally up or down), or to fight, and with which weapon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-26T20:03:57", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Classic Macintosh"], "developers": ["Silicon Beach Software"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
