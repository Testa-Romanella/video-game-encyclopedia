Venture through the depths of this new ocean world with your capsule communicator George who is on the radio to guide you on your mission. You must take radiation tests every 200 meters you go to ensure that you are not risking your safety and to see if the planet would be suitable for human life to inhabit the planet once more. Encounter different creatures long thought to be extinct as you go deeper and find what lurks down in the depths.<br/><br/>You play the entire game inside your submarine and the only way you can move your lever is down. George your capsule communicator will be guiding you on the way to prevent you from getting lost in what you're doing. He will guide you through puzzles such as finding hologram discs and working other parts of the ship. You must also manage your hunger and vitals during the trip. If they get too low, you will die. Food can be acquired through fishing and the vending machine.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are 4 main rooms in the ship that you must use. The first being the bridge, the bridge is where you control the movement of your submarine, it is a semi-circular glass dome so it is also the best view for the environment around you. The radio that George uses to communicate with you is in this room so being in the bridge is the only way to hear him.<br/><br/>The next most important room is the research room, this contains the hologram pad which you use to display radiation levels, fishing and many more hologram discs. This is your living quarters and where you spend most of your time on the journey there. It also holds the vending machine which is your main source of food during the expedition.<br/><br/>The next room is the engine room, it is where the engine powering the ship is held, there isn't much else in that room but you want to keep an eye on it because it can overheat sometimes. lastly is the ballast tank, this is what controls the buoyancy allowing the ship to go down.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T03:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/02669c67cd57e97e2b866bd14f215722.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vyvex Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vyvex Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
