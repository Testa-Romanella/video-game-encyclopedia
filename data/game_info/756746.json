{"id": 756746, "slug": "dawngeon", "name": "Dawngeon", "name_original": "Dawngeon", "description": "DAWNGEON is a pixel graphic mobile RPG (role-playing game) adopted from roguelike (random generated dungeons and monsters) gameplay. The player uses two joysticks to move and attack, which requires a lot of skills to master. Around 50 different items and weapons with interactable objects enable fun gameplay! The player can fight, cook, grow, and explore. <br/><br/>DAWNGEON has an interesting story with three different endings. It takes place in a world after the apocalypse. The player wakes up from a very long hibernation and goes on an adventure to explore this distant world 50 years after the Cracks. The Cracks opened the gateway from the underworld to the Earth, and monsters have attacked the cities, nearly ending humanity. People have survived, but few used their military forces to take over the world. The Tyrannical Government uses its imperial forces to control people\u2019s thoughts, actions, and freedom. The player is given the choice to follow the rebels to end this depressing world or fight against them. <br/><br/>DAWNGEON is a student indie project that one single developer has created. All aspects, including the graphics, pixel art, soundtrack, game systems, and designs, are all completed by Youngje Park with some outside resources used for tree graphics and sound effects. This game is free of charge with no advertisements.<br/><br/>This project has been influenced by Soul Knights, Undertale, and Archero. Originally, Park created this game to further experience the aiming system from Soul Knight, one of Park\u2019s favorite childhood games. Later, Park adopted its gaming and graphics styles while combining his other ideas. The level-up system from Archero and storytelling in Undertale have also added depth to this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T05:10:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58e/58e2f81e61f3fd86c6bf6739c1775cdb_H1hoEPw.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mid-Pacific"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Mid-Pacific Institute"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
