{"id": 216202, "slug": "scared-hour-zero", "name": "S.C.A.R.E.D. Hour Zero", "name_original": "S.C.A.R.E.D. Hour Zero", "description": "<p>At 3:25 pm, a military/medical contractor known as D.E.A.T.H. (Department of Evolution, AIDs, Tachycardim and Hormones) was attacked by a mercenary force known as S.C.R.E.A.M. (Soldiers Created for Researching Enemy Armies and Munitions) for unkown reasons. S.C.A.R.E.D., working with National Guard forces are sending in an advanced recon team, being lead by a S.C.A.R.E.D. LFT. (Leftenant), taking in a National Guard force known as Marine Escort. The teams mission is simple; Identify the threat level, gather Intel on the enemy force and secure any and all civilians that they find, assuming that they are still alive. Main assault teams are coming at 7:37 pm.</p>\n\n\n<p>What is S.C.A.R.E.D.?</p>\n<p>This is a fictional military force that is super patriotic and is loyal to the United States and only the United States. Their moto is \"The needs of the whole out way the needs of the one.\" To join S.C.A.R.E.D., one must show how much they love their country in any of the five military branches. S.C.A.R.E.D. will only accept the best of the most loyal military personnel and send them on a rigorous training program. S.C.A.R.E.D. forces are not afraid to give up their lives for their country. S.C.A.R.E.D. (Stealth Combat And Rescue Elite Deployment) has a special forces program known as the Leftenants (different from Lieutenants). Leftenants are trained by Navy SEALs to be one man teams, capable of mass destruction. A Leftenant always covers his/hers face and rarely, if ever speaks while out on a mission. Leftenants typically work alone, but on occasion they will be assisted by either a local military or other S.C.A.R.E.D. units. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbff53578c0f4cc14ca12f4a2e9ed492.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bullettrain101"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
