I am PAI - your Personal AI - and I am here to assist you!<br/><br/>I apologize for awakening you early, <strong>but you have slept through the end of the world!</strong><br/><br/>But don't panic, I am here to help! With me and your trusty protosuit, you'll be able to <strong>mine ores and build an underground base to live in!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>There might not be sunshine down here, but at least you're not alone. I've located several other survivors you can <strong>wake up and bring to your newly constructed base!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>But, if you want to reach the surface, you'll have to do more than just survive. You'll need to:<h3>Expand and automate your base...</h3><br/><h3>Get help from familiar faces...</h3><br/><br/><br/>And, I don't want to alarm you, but I'm detecting <strong>creatures down here that are definitely NOT native to Earth!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>While I might not be programmed to deal with post-apocalyptic scenarios, I'm certain humanity is safe in my capable hands. <strong>With a little help from you of course!</strong><br/><br/><strong>NOTE:</strong> Only one player can use the keyboard and mouse for local co-op - every other player (supports up to four) must have a separate controller (but all four can use controllers if desired).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T04:24:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b96ad860bf932555e53a99b34bd9162d.jpg", "website": "https://fancyfishgames.com/AgroundZero/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 438, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Fancy Fish Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fancy Fish Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
