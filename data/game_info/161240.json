The levels start from easy but quickly ramp up to be very difficult!<br/><br/>Playtime: &lt;5min<br/>No sound.</p>\r\nAfterthoughts\r\n<p>Initially, I wanted to make a very simple game for practicing one's mouse control. I\u00a0believe the first 7 levels have a nice difficulty curve which suits that goal.</p>\n<p>However, I think the last two levels are too hard and precise. As a result, they force small, tense movements out of the player. These kinds of movements aren't relevant to everyday mouse usage, so they aren't useful to practice.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the difficulty of those levels make them very rewarding to complete, so I left them in.\u00a0 It is interesting how the difficulty of a level can change the player experience; the first levels play &amp; feel very differently than the last levels.\u00a0<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it is hard to control the difficulty for a game based on mouse precision. The difficulty I designed my levels to be will be completely offset for some players due to having a mouse configuration different from mine. It's also possible for players to artificially change the difficulty by changing their DPI, mouse sensitivity or the game window's resolution.<br/><br/>Overall, making a game focused on mouse precision has a lot of troublesome design issues. I\u00a0think will avoid using it as a primary game mechanic in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b36/b364a5a41af6110769a37929d4ae1c63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clorica6"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
