All the sprites are located in \" ../assets/2.png\" .It's a 512*512 png .If you do change it ensure the width,height ,file format and pixel format  remain the same .I don't think \u00a0editing the sheet will lead to any adverse effects .The triples are animated with three frames ,in the sheet are vertically aligned . <br/></p>\n<p>PS if you do change the art , feel free to re-upload the entire package to your own page ,but please do credit me . Also I'd be happy to do the 'credit/about' page and include your information .<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Authors notes</p>\n<p>The game was built using SFML 2.5.1(c++ binding)\u00a0 and the source code is available\u00a0 here . Thank you , for trying my game , i hope it brings you joy ! If you have trouble running the game , please do leave feedback in the form of a comment , this was my first time using a framework instead of an engine . Also if there is interest in seeing this project become something more , i may begin development again and look into porting to windows . I don't claim to be an expert (i am not,just a hobbyist), but if you are learning c++ or just have any questions about the code feel free to ask me a question in the comments here.  <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:08:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d3/8d348fd804279dfa3e0b69c87e9f49be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Romeosierra13"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
