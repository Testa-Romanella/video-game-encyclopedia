But please enjoy and let me know how I can improve it, any help is appreciated!</p>\n<p>In Operation Foxtrot, you play as one of 5\u00a0(technically 4 right now) agents that form an elite group known as Alpha-Squad. You are deployed in to prevent an army of unknown origins composed of drones and soldiers that are on a mission to wipe each of you out and gain control of the metropolis.</p>\n<p>Currently there is only an endless, wave-type mode but in the future I hope to add a campaign, character progression, skins, new types of enemies and much more, but for now please enjoy what I've come up with so far!</p>\n<p>My work so far:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T16:16:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5e/d5ed57630a1a828aff317a1bfe2f4ef0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ollything373"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
