You might come back from death, but those 3 seconds to re-spawn are enough for them to regroup and make off with the goods. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The game features an adaptive AI where enemies will switch their roles of attacking you or going after their loot, and flocking behavior that you can exploit to cause them to smash into each other.</p>\n<p>I am eager to see how well you all do. In the comments, post your top scores under the Top Scores thread. There are also a thread for feature suggestions, and all are welcome as I am working on piling a bunch of new features on future iterations of this game.<br/><br/>Controls: <br/></p>\n<p>Left/Right\u00a0 - Steer<br/>A\u00a0 Button - Thrust<br/>B Button - Shoot</p>\n<p>For debugging purposes, you can press menu and check Show FPS. Let me know if you have any issues. I would be happy to fix them. <br/></p>\n<p>Note: this is meant for the Playdate game console, but you can also also download the playdate SDK and play the game on your mac or windows computer. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T05:42:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/312/3124f3d8110b2037fb9b5c239b4a2d4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neverall Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
