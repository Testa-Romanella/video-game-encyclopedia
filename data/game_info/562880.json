This is a basic 2d platformer game but we spent a lot of time to make this game\u00a0and we tried to make each level different and special. However, there are not much levels in the game. If the game receives enough reaction we will\u00a0continue to develope the game and add new levels.</p>\n<p>By the way, our next project will be a 2D Action RPG game. We will work harder for the next game and we need your support.\u00a0</p>\n<p>See you next time, enjoy the game !</p>\n<p>-\u015e\u00dcKR\u00dc AK\u0130F GAMES</p>\n<p>(The game only works properly\u00a0on 1080p screens, your screen resolution must be 1080p and\u00a0the scale setting in windows must be 100%)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T12:42:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f59/f594c61a12f8b6d1e971c8c15d5488bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sukruakifgames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
