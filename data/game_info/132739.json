Little Radish has to cast spells on the rot and decay currently destroying her home. But the more spells you cast, the harder it will become!</p><p>The message is that the more you use anti-biotics, the less effective they are. Initially I was going to add another option to represent just taking a day off and drinking Ribena, I would have also liked to have a second level, in another world, demonstrating that travellers may not be immune to bacteria in foreign lands.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f57ade40a73cad230349fc0ae103b24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["A Little Red Panda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
