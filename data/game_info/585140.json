The game entails 2-minute minigames, where you must protect a family from imminent death with just one button cell battery.</p>\r\nHow to play the game\r\n<p>Play the game by wiggling the button cell battery with your mouse (typically found inside the wind turbine) out of its container and moving it to the appliance that needs it the most. This could be the:</p>\n<ul><li>Carbon monoxide detector</li><li>Sprinkler</li><li>Light above the ladder</li><li>Lamp in the nursery</li><li>First floor elevator buttons</li><li>Boiler room (top right)</li></ul>\n<p>However, every 10-15 seconds, some issues will occur in the house, such as a cloud making people disappear in the nursery, or a carbon monoxide leak. These incidents will damage the five people in the house; however, all the problems can be resolved by plugging your one button cell battery into the respected appliance for a period of time. The further into the game you are, the more issues will happen at once.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to last for 120 seconds of torment, until the lights come back on. A score will be calculated afterwards, based off your:</p>\n<ul><li>Survivors</li><li>Health</li><li>Time</li></ul>\n<p>If the situation in the house gets too dire, you can press `abort` to immediately end the game with a lower score.</p>\r\nWhat's the highest score?\r\n<p>240120 is the highest score in the base game. However, you can increase the duration of the game from the title screen, which will reward you exponentially higher scores!</p>\r\nWhy is the game monochrome?\r\n<p>As stated in the introduction, this game was made in a Game Jam, with the limitations of two colours and one button. Rating my submission would be massively appreciated!</p>\r\nWhy is it not monochrome?\r\n<p>If you see greys surrounding the text, this is probably because you are not in a 16:9 aspect ratio. As far as I am aware, you can't stop anti-aliasing on TMP Text in Unity, even though anti-aliasing is not present in any other aspect of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T07:39:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c49/c49ba7ab264f847bfa1b2f626e2b27b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["X1 Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
