This is a little bug I need to fix!</p>\n<p>The Animation and the textures are mine, but some models are from xdemeraldplays and from JuztAndy (sketchfab.com).</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>You can teleport to the doors and the wardrobe. If something(or someone) is in front of the door, you have time before they come. Just hide in the wardrobe.\r\nBut... someone put his Fox there...\r\nNo problem, if something is behind the left door just hide in front the right door.\r\nEasy? Good.</p>\n\n<p>PS: I don't know... I have a feeling that someone wait for me when I survived the night. Just a feeling...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T05:41:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fc/1fc54dbc1f044f54f909e078efb78cd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GerBGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
