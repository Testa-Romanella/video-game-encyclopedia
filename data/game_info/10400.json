The player aims to escape from the advancing hordes of zombies. The main task is to survive as long as possible.</p>\n<p>The player takes control of the nameless survivor, who is to build a base and labyrinths in the daytime and defend it at night. YAZD is a top-down arcade zombie survival strategy game. For construction, there are protective barricades and turrets. The hero himself can shoot the zombies, and weapons for him can be bought and upgraded. The protagonist also has a somewhat complex skill tree.</p>\n<p>The game can be played alone or with friends, using the possibilities of cooperative mode or multiplayer. Lack of content, the game compensates with time-tested gameplay, which will entertain the player for several evenings. And if you go through the game with your friends, even more time will be spent. Problems with the launching of the game will also not here: because of unpretentious graphics YAZD can be run even on a calculator. The game was repeatedly dirt cheap on sales, and developers released HD remaster of the original game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6f/a6fe99e55059f65da90663b128d70564.jpg", "website": "http://www.awesomegamesstudio.com", "rating": 2.09, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 64, "owned": 1776, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 54, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 156, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 156, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Awesome Games Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awesome Games Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
