You can spend very two minutes playing with the out-of-the-box \"plot\" or make your own story with your own character and arts!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>TEXTY<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Missed the old good text user interfaces? Here is it, back in town. TUI is still in use (I'm using some TUI software every day, like Midnight Commander), but it feels so nostalgic anyway.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CUSTOMIZABLE<br/></strong></p>\n<p>You are free to alter the assets. You can change the entire dialog to your self written and replace all scenes. Navigate to res/ folder and see. All scenes are just .txt files with ASCII arts. To change the dialog you should be able to deal with JSON format.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for GameOff gamedev jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/66515219a2705a4cfcd10a101568f836.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mozhavro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
