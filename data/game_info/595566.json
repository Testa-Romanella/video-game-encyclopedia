The submarine will stay attached to a chain so we can pull you up after you found the lost city. Be careful of all the monstrous creatures, we\u2019ve got you equipped with light spots to scare them away. The battery for your light spots is rechargeable with a simple button push on the celling of the submarine. The deeper you\u2019ll go below the surface, the stronger the pression will be and unfortunately, your submarine will start filling with water, still, we\u2019ve got you equipped with a pump to get the water out. In case you need, we\u2019ve equipped your submarine with a lever allowing you to move it left and right but be careful not go too far or you\u2019ll break the submarine and the water will flow in faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:30:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d597992ac0f3439e703aa58e4f6e8a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["benatiu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
