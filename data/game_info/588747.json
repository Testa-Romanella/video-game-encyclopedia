Tonight I streamed a little bit of game dev messing to some friends who were curious, and because of the tools I use, PICO-8 is probably the most obscure, I showed them PICO-8 from scratch. And I had a lot of fun doing it! Friends? They're good actually.<br/></p>\r\nGame concept\r\n<p>You're a bird gliding over some nice flowers, but there are clouds. You should avoid the clouds or you'll punch a hole right through them! Don't worry though, it doesn't do anything bad.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left and right arrows to move the bird<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:38:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ed/9ed269eb9c9ed912a6ef8ea217dc92a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
