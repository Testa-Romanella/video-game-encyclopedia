However, the moment he \n      flipped the switch for the first official test, the machine exploded and \n      sprayed all of the professor\u2019s new multicolored fuel everywhere. He now \n      needs your help to collect the precious fuel, and repair the damage \n      caused before the worldwide energy symposium begins! Twist your Wii \n      Remote controller to place wooden planks, funnels, and particle \n      transportation portals to guide the fluids back to the correct \n      collection channels and repair the damage in thirty warped levels. The \n      professor will even have you tackling the dangerous task of mixing \n      fluids to create new fuel colors. Just make sure to contain the spill \n      before you cause an overflow!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e40808f65478d6c2555da549ec2c35a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Digital Leisure"], "esrb_rating": null}
