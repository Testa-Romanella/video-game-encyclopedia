The game challenges your sense of direction and\u00a0provokes\u00a0 helplessness as you flee inside the maze looking for the exit. Three monsters guard each section of the maze, you'll have to get the key first (One of two keys hidden in maze) and then get out of the maze.</p><p>Note : Hard mode of the game changes\u00a0 few\u00a0\u00a0in-game areas and adds more patrolling guards who are faster than the normal version.</p>\n\n<p>If you liked the game consider donating here on itch.io \u2764</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>Dev - Ritvik Shukla</p>\n<p>Music credits:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/lennyboy/sounds/244417/\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0scari violin<br/>https://freesound.org/people/officialfourge/sounds/341977/\u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0eerie music<br/>https://freesound.org/people/darkzanite/sounds/262292/\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Monster growl</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T03:19:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eee/eee200c87df81b6c9fd8539bcbf2c097.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ritvikshukla"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
