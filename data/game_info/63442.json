(MMO)<br/>As a player you'll be running a company, signing contracts with other players involving the exchange of goods and services.<br/>In this simulation, you are, just like in the real world, doing business with other player companies to make your profit. <br/>It is possible to choose who you deal with and who's pricing you'll try to undercut. There are different business branches available from where you can make your money:<br/><ul><li>Oil Refinery<br/></li><li>Transportation<br/></li><li>Storage<br/></li><li>Farming<br/></li><li>Banking<br/></li><li>Power Plants<br/></li><li>...</li></ul>Key to avoiding bankruptcy is making sure you run your business more cheaply than that of your opponents. (Signing better deals)<br/>Most of the branches need other branches to function. As an example: to generate power you have to rely on storage as well as oil transported to your power plant. Someone will also need to build your power plant for you (someone with a construction branch).<br/><br/><strong>Ventura Inc</strong> wants to bring you a game in wich you can play with your friends , work in team, communicate, trade and get rich.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47b3fa2648c6da7ee764f3d9d606ab0.jpg", "website": "http://ventura-inc.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Strijbos"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ben Strijbos"], "esrb_rating": null}
