All that you see might not be true, you may need to use your ability of vision of truth to escape. Use the vision carefully because it's not unlimited, you need to wisely use the vision at the right time to help you complete the level.\u00a0 The goal is to reach the green portal before the time runs out.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!!!</p>\n<p>[Currently there are only 3 levels, and first 2 don't even count because they are tutorial levels. I could have\u00a0added more and I probably will\u00a0but I ran out of time so I decided to make just one challenging level (Not to good at that), because there are a lot of entries and in case I had\u00a0like 10 levels, still no one would have bothered playing through all of it. After all the jam is about creativity,\u00a0sticking to the theme and bringing your ideas to life, and I think I accomplished it.]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:06:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/1828b198555dc47c217590d3e59f50ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aryan Rai"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
