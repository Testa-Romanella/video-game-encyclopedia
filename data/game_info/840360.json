You can use it to make voxel art, or you can just play around with it. In 3D computer graphics, a voxel represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. As with pixels in a 2D. So basically a voxel is a 3D pixel.</p>\n<p>I made this project with no experience of how graphics API's worked, i had to learn everything from scratch and i learned a ton along the way. The project is made with C# and OpenGL.<br/></p>\n<p>The project is closed source, but i am open to offers to sell the project and full ownership.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T14:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e79/e79df3fa7ac9f3c01c419b8cf3bb37e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sjoerdev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
