As he climbs higher up, he meets another captured being, and revisits his forgotten memories by collecting a magical book. As his past flashes by, he regains his ability to wield magic weapons. The top of the prison is guarded by the spirit Rohkin and his glowing sword. Only these that surpassed the trial of the crystal spikes may escape and start their life anew. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T10:34:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/389/389757065b3c313981131b6c10b7d13d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crittiko"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
