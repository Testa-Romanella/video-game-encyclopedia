Medications do not help, he turns to the shaman. The shaman understands what is going on and talks about the battle that happened 30,000 years ago. The battle between the great hero and the two Sisters of Chaos. One of the Sisters controlled the Light of the Sun, and the other - the Darkness of the Moon. The sisters lost the battle, and the hero imprisoned them. The shaman sees that a person with visions is an incarnation of the hero, and visions can mean that the Sisters managed to escape from prison. Now the hero has to fight the Sisters again.<br />\nThe path to the Sisters lies through several areas. Each area is protected by a Protector. Protectors were independent, but now they are bribed by Chaos and serve Chaos.<br />\nThere are numerous and different beings born from the energies of Light, Darkness or others. These creatures are trying to block the path of the hero. The gameplay arises as the use of the energies of Light and Darkness. The energies of Light are deadly to the creatures of Darkness and vice versa. The game ends when the Sisters are again defeated and will see the beauty of the world and stop wanting to destroy it.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2011-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T06:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f80/f805774c679cca1a1a472d9ac39c78b7.jpg", "website": "http://www.housemarque.com/games/outland/", "rating": 2.9, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 242, "owned": 3494, "beaten": 82, "toplay": 42, "dropped": 164, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 333, "suggestions_count": 404, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 335, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ubisoft", "Housemarque"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment", "Housemarque"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
