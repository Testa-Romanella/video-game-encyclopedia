However, the palette will change the environment around you as well, requiring constant swapping to get through the game. What you see here is a test demo of the game's airdash mechanic and movement system, taking place in the green palette. Color swapping and full levels will be added very soon, but until then I would love to gather feedback about how the main character handles. The game has a tutorial screen but just in case here are the controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD, Analog Stick, or DPAD</p>\n<p>Jump: P, Space, A (or Equivalent) on Controller</p>\n<p>Dash: O, Left Shift,\u00a0X (or Equivalent) on Controller</p>\n<p>Restart Demo: R, Select (or Equivalent) on Controller (NOTE: PS button for PS4 controllers)</p>\n<p>Fullscreen: Ctrl + F or Alt + Enter</p>\n<p>If you have feedback for the game, questions, or just want to hang out, join our official\u00a0Discord!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T03:07:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14b/14b2d5cc0a9229fc61f9c59f1f188dff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperCitrus"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
