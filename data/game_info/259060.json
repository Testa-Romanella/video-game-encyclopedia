Koolor is your game!<br/><br/>Koolor is a very simple and addictive game that consists in identifying which color is different in each game screen and tap the different color tile. It will help you exercise and improve your eyesight!<br/><br/>***DIFFERENT SHAPES AND COLORS***<br/><br/>The level of difficulty increases as the game progresses. The number of tiles will increase and colors will look more and more similar. Squares, hexagons, circles ... the silhouettes will change shape, color and size on each screen.<br/><br/>In addition time runs against you. How many levels will you be able to pass in the proposed time? The faster you can identify the intruder color, the more levels you can complete.<br/><br/>Not suitable for color-blind. This game is aimed at those people who have a great visual acuity and are able to differentiate the different shades of color that exist. Pay close attention, some colors are very similar!<br/><br/><br/>***COLOR SHADES***<br/><br/>Koolor has different types of colors to play with; from the primary colors to the pastel tones or softer tones. Red, orange, blue, pink, purple, green, yellow.... Discover all the palette of colors that exist. <br/>Whether Pantone, RGB or CYMK, you have to have a graphic designer eye to differentiate them at first sight.<br/><br/>At first it will be easy but you must have a sharp eye to pass the higher levels. Do you usually differentiate the green melon color from the green apple color? Then Koolor is made for you.<br/><br/>A hint: When you can not see the color at first glance, close your eyes a little to better focus the view. This will help you to better differentiate colors and to know what is different.<br/><br/>***ABOUT LUDEI***<br/><br/>In Ludei we create simple and addictive games for all ages.
