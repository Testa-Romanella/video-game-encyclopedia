This is the first time I submitted my game to this big event. My piece is called <strong>REK</strong> because\u00a0you have to wreck every inch of the house.</p><p>HOW TO PLAY : Once you click the start button, a new scene will load. You should drag the items in the house and throw them anywhere you want. The more you move the items in the house, the more points you get!</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy the game as I do. There may be a few bugs along the way but I think it doesn't ravage the gameplay.</p>\n<p>If you play it, give some feedback and ideas of how I should improve my dev crafts!</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assets that I used in my game :</p>\n<p>https://kayillustrations.itch.io/parallax-sunset-mountains\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>kayillustrations (https://kayillustrations.itch.io/)</strong></p>\n<p><strong> (beautiful pixel art assets btw)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:40:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/5609491d11f58c26d97e83f444d0cf6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["InvestTiGator"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
