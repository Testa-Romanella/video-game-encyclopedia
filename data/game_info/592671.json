{"id": 592671, "slug": "turtle-time-trial", "name": "Turtle Time Trial", "name_original": "Turtle Time Trial", "description": "<p>(Initial build thought up and created over 48 hours)<br/>This turtle might start out slow, but collect enough gems and you'll be zooming!</p>\n<p>Steer your way to the best time in a three-lap race track. Collect gems for a chance of increased max speed or a single-use jump, but be careful, there's a chance to reduce your speed too. Avoid falling in the water and losing half your max speed, and make your way through each lap as quickly as possible!</p>\n<p>There is controller support! (Though not for the menus...)</p>\n<p>The theme was \"environment impacts you\". I had a few thoughts but went simpler with \"power ups\" affecting the player, which in this case are the gems, or the water which is a hazard and will cause you to respawn. Two things I wanted to add were speed strips on the terrain, as well as pads that would bounce you up. While I'd have liked to have added them, I diverted away because they just affect your height and speed like the gems already did.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>All art assets (save for some built-in Unity UI stuff like panels and text): Me!
