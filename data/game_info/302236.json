I\u00a0don't know. That's really for the player to answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Is it just a fiction generator? No. There is a full game simulation built from scratch running on the back end using a game system I made up over a couple days based on reading about the L4D AI Director and some of the things I find interesting about narrative tabletop systems like Blades in the Dark and Dungeon World.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0didn't make this expecting it to be good, I made it expecting it to be neat, and I think it's neat. I hope you do too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T04:11:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/abad8e69f5bafeb79b962f518b46ac5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["greater_nemo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
