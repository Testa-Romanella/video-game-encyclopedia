Unfortunately, a key ingredient is missing. Look around to see if you can find an appropriate substitute. If you're feeling particularly creative, you can substitute multiple foods at once for a fun combination. If you're feeling particularly desperate, you can use something that isn't food at all! And if you're feeling both creative and desperate, you can combine a non-food item with one or more foods for a substitution.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility</strong><strong>:</strong> voice accessibility mode (read items on mouseover) is on by default. You can turn this off in the settings.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> mouse. I wanted to make this work with keyboard/controller as well, but ran out of time. You can still use keyboard/controller in the menus (start menu, settings) if you like.</p>\n<p><strong>Bugs:</strong> there is a known bug that if accessibility mode is turned on, the audio for settings will play even after you close the menu. To stop this (assuming you want accessibility mode on),\u00a0leave the start page (start the game or open recipe select) and then the settings will not play again until you open the menu. Please report any other bugs you find, as I'm not aware of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong> I ran out of time to make in-game credits, so I've posted them here:</p>\n<ul><li>Catherine DeJager: programming, voice acting, sfx, collecting art</li><li>Rosko Vair: music</li><li>Art sources:<ul><li>Font: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/note-this</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/cc0-food-icons (OCAL and Glitch packs)</li><li>https://thenounproject.com/:\u00a0https://thenounproject.com/term/x-button/1600389/\u00a0by James Henry,\u00a0https://thenounproject.com/term/full-volume/208035/\u00a0and\u00a0https://thenounproject.com/term/mute/208037/\u00a0by Universal Icons, US</li><li>https://www.shutterstock.com/\u00a0purchases: https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/open-vacuum-locker-142446328, https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/sponge-vector-flat-icon-isolated-emoji..., https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/fridge-open-closed-300929471, https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/white-cauliflower-vegetable-isolated-o..., https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/illustration-japanese-seasoning-word-w..., https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/cartoon-seaweed-set-vector-graphic-ill..., https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/cardboard-box-set-on-transparent-backg...</li><li>http://clipart-library.com: http://clipart-library.com/clipart/1518252.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/1728490.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/yeast-cliparts_8.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/sugar-cliparts_19.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/22947.htm,\u00a0\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/61837.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/hay-bale-cliparts_10.htm, http://clipart-library.com/clipart/pT5o6XLkc.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/281423.htm, http://clipart-library.com/clipart/55902.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/1499064.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/1406365.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clip-art/soap-clipart-transparent-6.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/sponge-cliparts_3.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/tennis-ball-png-image.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/toothpaste-cliparts_12.htm,\u00a0http://clipart-library.com/clipart/57491.htm)</li><li>https://pixabay.com/vectors/strawberry-jelly-jam-sweet-jar-5281066/</li><li>https://www.hiclipart.com/free-transparent-background-png-clipart-xntkp</li><li>Godot Wild Jam wildcard art:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-31</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T04:32:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ce/9cea7e32f5e793b46516eaf156b7ffbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["cmd16", "Rosko Vair"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
