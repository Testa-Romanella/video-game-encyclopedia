It also aims to become a fully decentralized game based on the Steem blockchain. Please check the blog to see how transactions are expected to be decentralized on Steem.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Its first Steem token, the SPWALPHA, was already issued!</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Splinterwars, you will be able to play your card collection and engage in\u00a0battle against stacks automatically created from other player collections.</p>\n<p>You will fight in challenges, events,\u00a0collect trophies, achievements, and unlock new skills and items. Not in this first version, obviously; but the game is meant as durable.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements are strongly tied to your Splinterlands collection: this means you must have Splinterlands to play. It is\u00a0voluntary.</strong></p>\n<p>Please head to\u00a0Splinterlands website ( https://splinterlands.io\u00a0) to enjoy this game!</p>\n<p>This demo does not go very far at all.\u00a0It will take less than 10 minutes of your time to test it.\u00a0It\u00a0will reveal to you the first screens of Splinterwars, and hint at the next features to come.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nCurrent features include:\r\n* Connecting your account with Steem Connect and <strong>importing your collection</strong>.\r\n* <strong>Choosing enemy stacks to battle.</strong>\u00a0These enemy stacks are created from all collections imported thus far.\r\n* You can choose a summoner and creatures, and engage in battle.\r\n\n<p><strong>Unfortunately the battle will end with the \"very anti-climatic\", confusing\u00a0start of a battle log.</strong></p>\n<p>Yup, just like that!</p>\n<p>Next versions will of course include an animated battle, and fix a collection of bugs.<br/></p>\n\n<p>During the game jam, a new server and webservices were also set up (\u00a0on\u00a0https://splinterwars.com\u00a0). This is where most of the work has gone.<br/></p>\r\nYou may use its Public API, and read more about it on this blog:\r\n\n<p>https://steemit.com/@elindos<br/></p>\n<p><em>(\u00a0https://steemit.com/splinterlands/@elindos/splinterwars-first-alpha-and-public-api-released\u00a0)</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>As you can guess, a lot of time was dedicated to recreating the whole 113 creatures of Splinterlands, simulate it's battles and recreate a web server, online database, steem connect integration in an executable client,\u00a0and a collection of webservices.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>This demonstration shows the roots made in a two weeks time.\u00a0Next versions will include more features!</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Being a full webservice, Splinterwars says:</p>\n<p><em>I will exist and continue.</em></p>\n<p>This project does not aim at being a sole game jam experiment, but to continue as a full game and bring real value.</p>\n<p>Next features will include a campaign, much more polish, and of course an animated battle.</p>\n<p>Next releases will include Mac versions, and in the future, Linux versions too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Multiplatform is made easy as a multiplatform language was used to make the game; only problem being the costs of additional export licenses. (especially for mobile platforms)</p>\n<p>The following articles discussed what was made and a number of ideas.\u00a0Feel free to take part!</p>\n<p>https://steemit.com/splinterlands/@elindos/announcing-splinterwars-a-new-game-set-in-the-splinterlands-lore-and-assets</p>\n<p>https://steemit.com/splinterlands/@elindos/splinterwars-a-quest-to-give-valuation-to-our-assets</p>\n<p>https://steemit.com/game/@elindos/splinterwars-campaign-will-be-released-soon-after-the-game-jam</p>\n<p>You may also join its discord server.
