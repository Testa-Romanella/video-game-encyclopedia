Well, at least you thought that was the case. Like most everyone else, we think the simulator genre has gone too far (We're looking at you, KFC Dating Sim....).  However, instead of rallying against the deluge of downright weird simulators, we've decided to add to the growing abyss of them. Loading Screen Simulator started out as a joke between family members about the madness of the current simulator genre. Now it's progressed to a functional alpha build with goals to have a full game released by the end of the year. Keep checking back, as it's going to keep getting better? How, you ask? More loading screens, of course! Yes, there will be easter eggs for those of you that get through the first few loading screens. Will there be jump scares? Maybe. You'll have to progress through the loading screens to find out. Will there be some cool trivia hidden somewhere in the midst of all the loading screen madness? Possibly, if we can figure out how to code that. What's our end goal? World domination through a large amount of non-functional loading screens, of course! (We may be joking here, or there may be a Chinese spy balloon in there somewhere...If you're the CIA or any government agency reading this, we're just kidding! There's no spyware here). We just hope that our end product is as absurd as it sounds!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\no Loading Screen images rotate randomly<br/>\r\no Hundreds of loading screen images at launch, with more being added every day<br/>\r\no Interactive loading screens (maze challenges, puzzles, and more!) that can be turned on or off<br/>\r\no Real-life and fantasy scenery!<br/>\r\no Can be used as a safety screen in many situations. <br/>\r\no Music that can be turned on or off throughout the screens", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/534/53402def5a5a07ffad618a8594f79f7e.jpg", "website": "http://cakeeatergames.ru", "rating": 2.39, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 22, "owned": 565, "beaten": 33, "dropped": 26, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 66, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 67, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CakeEaterGames", "Blaze Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CakeEaterGames", "Blaze Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
