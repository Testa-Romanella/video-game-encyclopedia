Players have 100 turns to try to return home. In the final version of the game, this is extended to 200-500.</p>\n<p>While Temporian is well tested, and approaching the final stages of development, you may still stumble upon a few bugs here and there.\u00a0If you enjoy the game or have any feedback, please let me know! I'd love to hear from you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T14:17:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d1/4d1382ca6ca81c2cd225a7abc0226700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChallAcc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
