Wow! You're the last to leave a party, claiming the leftover BEANS and other party concessions. But watch out, as the security personnel are hunting you down! Frantically run in a scramble to take control of your own movements. Eating all the beans brings peace.</p>\n<p>You can use WASD <strong><em>or</em></strong> the arrow keys to move.<br/></p>\n<p>Picking up bottles resets your \"missed beats\" counter to avoid losing health, but also gives a little extra <em>spin</em> to your movement! Picking up beans restores lost health, and brings you closer to completing the game, but be wary for it increases the stakes too...<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK Jam of 2020! Our concept was mostly to mash up games like Crypt of the NecroDancer and Back Off Barbarian from Castle Crashers in order to incite the highest level of chaotic and frantic gameplay we could get - a perfect fit for the \"Out Of Control\" theme of the jam!<br/></p><p>Credits:</p><p>Hunter (borbo) Yager- Lead Programming</p><p>Ryan (Eternal Medic) Langlie- Lead Sound + Art Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:07:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92f/92f69da9eeaf7d7a02923f2901979176.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Borbo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
