Am i happy with the game i made? not really. It was my first time tackling the horror genre so i think i failed miserably. It\u2019s not a good horror game and its not a good game overall. Usually my games have a great focus on different and unique mechanics, this game seems lazy when compared to most of my games, it has a basic mechanic and its focus on story didn\u2019t help. Also i\u2019m not good writer so it just made the game worse.\r\n</p>\n<p>I also learned that unity HDRP can not be exported to web.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a6/7a66bca1ba178b7227b352696eac52e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lenan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
