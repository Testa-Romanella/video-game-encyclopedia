There have been two cases similar to this one, and with the help of a special watch, you can travel back in time to check out the past crime scenes. The string that ties them all together, all back to this one criminal, is the specific theme that denotes this character\u2019s figure in this film noir-style reality. When this killer strikes, a specific sting plays every time. Walk through three crime scenes: one from a year ago, one from two years ago, and one from the present day, to stop the killer this time before it\u2019s too late. As you walk around the scenes, the criminal\u2019s theme will gradually speed up, and when you\u2019re in view of a clue, the sting will play, letting you know what to look out for on the day of the crime. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T07:27:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4d/a4dda4a99c16066ad698c7833ebd332d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mattie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
