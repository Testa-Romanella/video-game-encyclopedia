Exploiting the flexibility with which our reality is constructed, it aims to challenge traditional systemic notions of truth. \u00a0<em>Depth Perception</em>\u00a0seeks to debase and deconstruct the conventional binary of abstract/mental and material/physical.</strong>\n\n\n<p>Immersive technologies serve to mediate our perception of the world. An immersive technology experience can make us aware of the malleability of our sensory perception in crafting an understanding or interpretation of all that we deem external to ourselves. An emergent field, immersive technology art and design includes virtual and computer-mediated reality tools, which can be deployed to raise questions and close the gap between conceptions of what is \u2018artificial\u2019 and what is \u2018real.\u2019<br/></p>\n<p>Jean Baudrillard, who coined the term \u2018hyperreality,\u2019 defines it as \u201ca real without origin or reality.\u201d In this most basic definition, stripped of any historical-cultural context, \u2018hyperreality\u2019 seems to suggest that fundamental authenticity is not only elusive, but without meaning. From this perspective, any understanding of the external world assumes a genericized role as yet another indiscernible layer of abstraction in an amorphous framework, existing without hierarchy. In this vacuum of both authority and meaning, the subjective experience of a unified consciousness becomes the basis for reasoning with one\u2019s surroundings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilizing immersive multimedia tools, such as VR, for their impressive resolution of representation and effectiveness in bringing these questions to light,\u00a0<em>Depth Perception</em>\u00a0aims to evoke a confused verisimilitude, suggesting a \u2018hyperreal\u2019 nature of existence, along with the arbitrariness and sentimentality with which we attribute authenticity to the perceived. The form of this project is that of a multimodal experiential installation, with the intention of creating a disconnect between the user and their environment. This installation takes place between an infinite number of room pairs, each room serving as a loose reflection of its counterpart adjoined through a common window, with a shifting relationship.</p>\n\r\n\r\nRead the full document\u00a0here.\r\n<p>Early first-look for the\u00a0Designing Multiplicity\u00a0exhibition.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd1ac570c4ffcabd66086ed7c29c17fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Juno AM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
