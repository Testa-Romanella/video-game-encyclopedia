After the attacker runs out of mana by casting spells, the players switch places.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This game was originally created as a submission to the Kennesaw State University Fall Jam 2019, and was tied for third place! The current version has a lot more features than the original jam version, which includes updated graphics, new characters, new spells, and a new single player mode.<br/></p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter for more updates!</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This game was inspired by the hit indie classic <em>Undertale</em> by Toby Fox. As a joke, I added a character from <em>Undertale</em> (Sans) as a playable character.
