(6 in total, 7 if you count starting area)</p>\n<p>*Added in some extra options in the pause menu.</p>\n<p>*Modified some sounds, weapons and effects</p>\n<p>Shoutout to Christian Pilz, who, during the 2020 Christmas Jam managed to throw together an awesome wolfenstien-ish fps called Ultra Nightmare. I remember thinking this was amazing and that one day I would have to make an attempt myself.<br/></p>\n<p>Also to Yuri Pourre, who's Oriented Bounding Box PR code I used for the Enemy Decal Hitboxes.</p>\n<p>Underground Exterminator!<br/></p>\n<p>Story:<br/></p>\n<p>The local village has been troubled with monsters coming out from the old underground gem mine.\u00a0 They don't have much to offer. Butkilling foes and collecting\u00a0gems was all you needed to hear. Hopefully those monsters are no match for your trusty axe\u00a0 uh.... yea. Maybe next time, come better prepared. Though with any luck you might find some better artillery laying around. Ya know... because the other guys didn't make it back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Game\u00a0Tips:<br/></p>\n<p>Press ESC\u00a0in Game to\u00a0check pause options menu for mouse sensitivity +\u00a0 extras.</p>\n<p>(In the HTML version you will have to press escape twice, once for the browser to let go of the cursor, and the second for it to register in the game, you MUST click the unpause button for libGDX to regain control on the mouse!)</p>\n<p>Look for keys to Open locked doors.</p>\n<p>Collect Gems (12 in total).</p>\n<p>Infinite ammo(because I ran out of time to balance it)</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for a special type of \"Booster\" powerup.</p>\n<p>For best performance, download it (obviously).<br/></p>\n<p>Tips for playing in the browser:\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game catches the mouse cursor. And the browser gets really funky with that. But I tried my best to work around it. Going to the pause menu and clicking Unpause should always work to re-capture the mouse in the html version.</p>\n<p>If you die and need mouse control: just press escape. libGDX won't uncatch the cursor in gwt for some reason.<br/></p>\n<p>Default:\r\n</p>\n<p>WASD + Mouse</p>\n<p>Cycle Weapons with Q or E\u00a0 or Mouse Wheel</p>\n<p>Open/Interact: Space Key</p>\n<p>Be wearing of performance. It's an unoptimized 3D game after all.</p>\n\n<p>Assets Used:\r\n</p>\n<p>Textures and Sprites:</p>\n<p>Weapons -https://www.realm667.com/index.php/en/repository-18489<br/></p>\n<p>Textures -\u00a0https://vectorpixelstar.itch.io/textures</p>\n<p>Enemies -\u00a0https://deepdivegamestudio.itch.io/demon-sprite-pack</p>\n<p>Other -https://untiedgames.itch.io/super-pixel-objects-sample</p>\n<p>Music and Sounds -\u00a0https://lonepeakmusic.bandcamp.com/album/freebies</p>\n<p>-https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsVfn9YIFmNA5BbgWyjLZ4MlDEemQqa7C<br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a0https://sidearm-studios.itch.io/ultimate-music-bundle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T11:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fb/3fb8d86ac06de3c8e3ae72414257a327.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["BobIsHere"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
