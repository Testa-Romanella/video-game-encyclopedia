Japanese crosswords? Paint by sudoku? They are the same: cleverly designed brain-training puzzles. Nonograms Prophecy has dozens of them!<br />\nHow does it work? The numbers on the top and on the left side of the puzzle show how many pixels need to be filled in horizontally and vertically. Use your logic skills to choose the correct pixels and reveal a hidden picture. Your score depends on the time it takes you to solve the puzzle. Every mistake adds a penalty to the timer.<br />\nKill a bit of time (while waiting for the bus, for example) to solve one of the easiest puzzles with 5x5 pixels. Be ready to devote much more time to deal with the bigger puzzles \u2013 pixels up to 20x20 \u2013 the hardest ones.<br />\nNonogram Prophecy offers over 100 puzzles with pictures divided into thematic groups: food, zodiac, vehicles, etc.FEATURES<br />\nInteractive tutorial will explain everything easily<br />\nA game for 10 minutes or 10 hours<br />\nOver 100 nonogram puzzles<br />\nFour puzzle sizes - from 5x5 to 20x20 pixels</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T22:27:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f31/f310b17f863a2b2fa7466db88c9c467a.jpg", "website": "http://fatdoggames.com/game/nonogram-prophecy-2-copy/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Fat Dog Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fat Dog Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
