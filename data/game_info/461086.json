Maybe THEY, don\u2019t want you to know about the game that lets you explain conspiracy theories, and can be played over zoom. Maybe THEY don\u2019t want you to wear a tinfoil hat. It\u2019s all starting to make sense.</p>\n<p>ConspirSAY is a group game that brings out your inner conspiracy theorist. One player plays the theorist and attempts to explain something only they seem to understand to the rest of the group. They draw pictures, connect ideas with pieces of string or draw frantic lines on a whiteboard, and point wildly as new words are slowly added to the goal sentence that only they can see. The theorist has to adapt, changing their conspiracy board as they go and hoping the group can follow their thought process. When the goal sentence is complete, a buzzer sounds and the theorist gets to explain... kind of. The theorist can speak as long as they don\u2019t use any of the words from the goal sentence while they\u2019re talking. Then, the group has to try to guess the sentence using whatever clues the theorist has left them on their board.\u00a0</p>\n<p>ConspirSAY was inspired by that .gif of Charlie Day from It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia when he\u2019s trying to explain Pepe Sylivia. We use that .gif a lot. We wanted to make a game where the player reaches a point where they gesture wildly at their wall of incomprehensible post-it notes and beg the other players to understand.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nYou while playing this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8facb6987d8ba1fc054572b172495dd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dennispr"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
