Can you and your kids find a way to both survive and kill the cultist leader in this adventurous dungeon crawler filled with a compelling story, AAA voice acting and an amazingly designed UI? Good luck!</p>\n<p>Made in 7 days with no proper testing for the Dungeon Crawler Game Jam 2023. A speedrun to the end credits takes about 10-15 minutes total.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move, QE to turn<br/>Interact with the world using Space or F, there may be secrets hidden in the walls.<br/>Once you get equipment, hit things with LMB, block things with RMB</p>\n<p>Can also be played with 4568 (numpad return is the interact key)<br/></p>\n<p>Has experimental support for a low res mode and a low poly mode, for aesthetics and/or performance reasons.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Hints and spoilers</strong><br/></p>\r\nStarting prison room 1You will need to find a loose brick in one of the walls, then press F or Space to adjust it\r\nStarting prison room 2Look for the wooden wall, then inspect the stone wall opposite from the wooden wall\r\nStarting prison room 3It's slightly above and right from the center, poking out. You can also see it while viewing the wall sideways\r\nSecond room 1Beyond the room there is a door to the left and a pathway to the right. Both of these corridors have a loose brick somewhere in them\r\nSecond room 2Each wall type has its secret brick in the same spot\r\nSecond room 3The red brick wall has a loose brick on the right side of the long straight corridor, one tile before the dead end tile<br/>\r\nSecond room 4The gray brick wall has a loose brick in one of the corner tiles. There is a torch on one of the corner tiles, and the wall is on the tile just before that\r\nwtf combat mechanics and magic?\r\nThe way you kill enemies determines which weapon gets stronger. You will need 3 kills more with the sword, or 8 kills more with the shield to unlock this power. However, if any weapon exceeds 8 kills, the other weapon stops functioning (e.g. the sword cannot attack anymore, the shield cannot bash/stun anymore)\r\nHow can I save everyone?Little Timmy can be saved by stunning The Beast of Tugadres to death at least 3/5 times. You will need to be below 8 sword kills, and each \"kill\" on the Beast also counts so keep that in mind. Little Jenny can be saved depending on your alignment. Stay below 8 sword kills and below 3 shield kills to not be forced to engage and let the cultist leader teleport out.\r\nHow can I get the perfect ending?This one is tricky. You will need to start the Tugadres fight between 4 and 7 sword kills, and you MUST end the Tugadres fight with more than 3 sword kills AND you must kill Tugadres with at least 3 shield kills. This will bring back Timmy. If you then have between 3 and 7 sword kills, you will not auto-engage the cultist leader, but you can throw a void bolt into his face. Don't hit little Jenny and the cult leader will die before he can kill her.\r\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Pretty much all the content in this game was made from scratch by myself within the 7 days of the game jam.
