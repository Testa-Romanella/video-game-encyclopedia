You\u00a0have to avoid traps, run, jump, climb, solve puzzles\u00a0and get to the checkpoint. This game is\u00a0made for the LOWREZJAM 2021. It's very difficult to guess what trap will appear next because of the FOV and game mechanics too. It's very fun to play but difficult as well.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ol><li>Move - Arrow Keys</li><li>Jump - Space</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T08:34:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab7/ab7b203c59237b545aa072953267f773.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GameForGaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
