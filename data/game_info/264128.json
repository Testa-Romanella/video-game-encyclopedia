Troubled by the poor quality of life and the excessive amount of damage inflicted on Earth, they decide to plant new colonies on distant planets. The Earth military (EDF or Earth Defense Fleet) is in charge of organizing and carrying out this immense project. During the colonization, the EDF encounters a new life form, which turns out to be extremely hostile. Multiple attacks on EDF key installations, as well as on a research ship, force the EDF to improvise new strategies for a full evacuation. You are a high ranking officer of the EDF, who is in the midst of all the action. Make sure you all get back home to Earth safe &amp; sound.<br/><br/>_________________<br/><br/>SPACE BORDERS ONLINE<br/><br/>\u2022 spaceborders.proboards.com - submit feedback, feature requests &amp; more<br/>\u2022 facebook.com/spacebordersapp - receive the latest news about Space Borders<br/>\u2022\u00a0http://spaceborders.proboards.com/thread/260/ - Conquest Mode FAQ<br/><br/>THANK YOU<br/><br/>Thank you all for supporting Space Borders with reviews, ratings, ideas for new features and a lot more.
