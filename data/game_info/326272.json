There is also an auction house, where you can trade from self-found items extracted essences with other players. There is no currency, you can only trade with those.<br/>In addition, you can craft your own items with those essences, which you can then not only wear yourself, but they will also be contributed to the game database and other players can find your items themselves, being confronted with your signature. To top it all off, there is a leaderboard, where the best players are listed. There are no limits, no highest level, no strongest item. You can always become stronger.Features:<ul><li> auction house<br/></li><li> randomly generated terrain<br/></li><li> unique ability system<br/></li><li> craft items<br/></li><li> crafted items can be found by others<br/></li><li> god powers<br/></li><li> no boundaries, infinite levels, infinitely strong items<br/></li><li> multiplayer (via internet)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-29T14:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ec/9ecd19918ee16adf6966c8d2d8759e2a.jpg", "website": "https://www.valleyofdecay.com/index.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mario Papadopoulos"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mario Papadopoulos"], "esrb_rating": null}
