I cut and paste parts of the track here and there &amp; used change speed/pitch in audacity to edit the song. These are the only changes applied &amp; I dont feel it is transformative enough to call it my own work. upon request I can make this version available.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/353ae6bc5a1ce3f2c5a1e9bf140d823e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mochamas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
