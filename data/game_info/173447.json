The Ruin Jam came to my attention because about everything bad about the game industry and I thought \"well in that case it doesn't matter if the game is shit!\" I decided to focus on both sloppy mobile ports and the abundance of microtransactions in mobile games. So after like, a day of \"work\"I uploaded the game. While it <strong>is </strong>a bad exuce for a videogame in general; I genuinly think my point of mobile games being mostly crap holds up. Take a look at this video, for example. Several of these were most likley made by downloading free Unity assets, adding something from a somewhat popular franchise and the bloating with ads and/or viruses to make money. All while spending the minmuin ammount of effort possible to make the \"games\". And that's more-or-less what I did! (minus the ads and viruses, of course) I downloaded GameMaker, slapped in some assets from the internet, added (fake) microtransactions and called it a game.</p>\n<p>i need to actually try and make games though</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLLS: Q and A to control the left paddle, O and L to control the right one, mouse navigates the menus.<br/></p>\n<p>Old description:<br/></p>\n<p>As we all know, smartphone games tend to be rather rubbish.</p>\n<p>What happens when one of the most important games of all time gets ported to the mobile phone?</p>\n<p>Let me tell you; it's not a good sight.
