The theme of the jam was \"unexpected anticipation.\" </p>\n<p>Bad Hombres is that moment in a western where someone walks into a saloon, and nobody is sure whether they're there for a drink, or to shoot up the place. </p>\n<p>You play as a saloon patron playing poker, and various potentially bad hombres walk in. Will you defend yourself, or will you shoot down an innocent man? Can you take down the bad hombres without becoming one yourself?</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a simple reflex-based one-input game where players can replay to beat their previous high scores. </p>\n<p><strong>Train Jam Info:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in 52-hours aboard the California Zephyr express.
