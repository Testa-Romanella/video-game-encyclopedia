You're a virus shooting code, and you're shooting your code.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blue guards are against you.\u00a0To harm a guard, shoot the combination of 0 and 1 which is above its head. A destroyed guard will drop red spheres \u2014 pick them to regain health.\u00a0When you see a weakened guard flick (its health is\u00a0 &lt;50%), press F to create an ally to fight beside you.
