I wanted to create an interactive gallery experience that could be played through and infinite, looping as a GAN does. There are many dogs in the exhibit, the player will notice. These are all based on different seeds input into the Generator. These first iterations, some of which are birds and some of which are dogs, are then refined into the second iteration, which are at the later half of the exhibit. As the player moves through the exhibit, the images in the frames change, showing the progression of how a GAN moves through latent space.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T15:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/022/022d74ab6dcf42e74944b245b5475f84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["TheBruceSwain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
