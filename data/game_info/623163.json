Besides adding a small amount of screen shake on heavy or critical hits, I also freeze time for a fraction of a second on successful hits.</p>\n<p>I made a few placeholder assets using particle systems for the hit effects, and small explosions.\u00a0I\u00a0also modified some of the character assets to repurpose them.</p>\n<p>Normal (original)\u00a0Attack animation with and without hits:</p>\n<p>Heavy Attack (I\u00a0slowed down the animation, duplicated slashes, and extended the visual range as well)</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Shield\u00a0Bash was originally a stationary\u00a0Block animation, but I didn't like how blocking played out in combat.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0used the first part of the Block animation then ended the animation after dashing forward\u00a0 to get a Shield Bash.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Certain enemies have an outline to indicate when they can't be stunned, and are not affected by stuns.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\r\nAssets Used\r\n<p>Hero\u00a0Knight - Sven\u00a0Thole\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bandits - Sven\u00a0Thole</p>\n<p>Medieval Warrior - Luiz Melo\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pixel Art Forest - Eder</p>\n<p>Pixel Font - Thaleah</p>\n<p>Village Props - Cainos\u00a0(Scarecrow/Campfire)</p>\n<p>Pixel Art Icon Pack - Cainos\u00a0(Potion)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T06:35:20", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jon"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
