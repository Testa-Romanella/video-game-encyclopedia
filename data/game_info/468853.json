And a lone warrior roams across these broken lands; made immortal by ancient rites...</p>\n<p>This is a concept demo. It's not intended as a full game but rather an exploration of ideas. I'm no artist, so the sprites are mostly from rvros monster pack here on itch and the music is from <em>Alexander Nakarada</em> <em>(www.serpentsoundstudios.com</em>). Its only 3 levels long (~15 min) but I hope you enjoy the game.
