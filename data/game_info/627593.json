Come, adventurer! Come and be a part of the creation of a world! Come and live, fight, and reap rewards in a realm ruled by imagination! The denizens of Ambardia await you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Players can use the extensive storyline, world mythology, and quest-driven gameplay as tools to help determine a destiny for their characters. The game graphics are based on tilesets from the Golden Age of MMORPGs, and an original soundtrack accompanies players on their adventures, providing a classic ambience as they explore everything the world has to offer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A nonlinear skill system with numerous options allows players to tailor their characters towards a host of activities and professions.
