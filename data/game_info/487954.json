You only make games based on periods at RMIT if you want to).</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Movement: WASD<br/>Jump: Spacebar or Leftclick<br/>View: Mouse<br/>Press ESC to close</p>\n<p>When the world is flooded, please head to the cervix (the large doughnut shaped object in the middle of the map)</p>\n<p>WARNING:<br/>You absolutely can jump off the map and fall off the world.<br/>...Please don't do that.<br/><br/>WARNING WARNING:<br/>This is a prototype. This means it's working on a wish and a prayer. Be kind!
