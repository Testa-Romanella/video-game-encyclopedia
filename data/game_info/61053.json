Using these two functions, you will run, jump, and at times even shoot your way through numerous chambers packed with enemies designed to test your ability. How will you overcome them all and face the final challenge, when your own weapon is damaging to use? How will you make every shot count, when shooting hurts?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is 100% free, and features no In-Game purchases or microtransactions", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a3/9a3ae8c6f19a53bd21667b79f0e7def9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jakob Vidal"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jakob Vidal"], "esrb_rating": null}
