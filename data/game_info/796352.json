Each unit has an attack and defense value that decides if a unit can push an opponent unit in its way or not.\u00a0To win you still have to get three units in a row, but to archive this you now have to think ahead and plan your next moves.</p>\n<p>Currently there are 5 different units to play with and with that this is a very small game with still much strategic potential.</p>\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>Online multiplayer with people that are not in your network is not supported.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>We would love to receive feedback on\u00a0what you think about this game!
