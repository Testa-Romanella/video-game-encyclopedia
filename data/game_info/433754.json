Explore the world, go off the beaten track, find new enemies and abilities, and much more!</p>\n<p>The game was made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 46 Game Jam, in which the theme was 'Keep It Alive'. I was the sole developer, who handled art, programming, ect.</p>\n<p>The game is short (about 5-15 minutes), but I tried to pack as much in there as possible! I plan on continuing development on the game in the coming weeks, fixing a few issues, as well as adding brand new things!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Music Credits</em></strong></p>\n<p>Music was sourced from\u00a0freemusicarchive.org, and the following songs were used:</p>\n<p>Audiobinger - Video_Game_Music_1</p>\n<p>Komiku - 22 - The_adventure</p>\n<p>Visager - 04 - The_Great_Forest</p>\n<p>Visager - 05 - Battle<br/></p>\n<p>Visager - 12 - Title_Theme_Loop<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Please Note</em></strong>: to continue forwards in text boxes, press E.
