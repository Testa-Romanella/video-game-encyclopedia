These beings look and act just like any person, however, they are born through the subconscious mind of another human called the host, and their lives are linked in several different ways:<br/><br/>Even though tulpas look human, they cannot die by normal means, but, in exchange, their lifespans are very limited.\r\nIf the human host dies, the tulpa will also die, and vice versa. For this very reason, they are forced to cooperate with each other if they want to stay alive.\r\nThe only way to extend their lifespans is by fighting and killing another tulpa and their host in a duel.
