Screaming into the void as its visage quivers through unstable anatomies.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The text [ body ] is relentless. The text [ body ] is an animal that desires survival. The\u00a0text [ body] is fierce and oppressive. The text [ body ] is continuous; it perseveres. Where are your blank spaces? With what do you fill them? Where is the mother of your body? Is the goddess of your variables a black hole like mine? The universe is infinite with permutations. Re-string the harps and loop the cups so they never empty.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>Written by Danika Stegeman LeMay</p>\n<p>Designed and Published by CLOAK.\r\n</p>\n<p>Learn more at\u00a0cloak.wtf\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T07:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e74/e742f1ab8a79cdacdc548862013b0a89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CLOAK"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
