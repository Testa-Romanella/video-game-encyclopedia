Its a arcade stile top down shooter with online leaderboards. Sadly the project ist lost due to a broken harddisk. I learned my lesson and will start developing other games now. This is the alpha version i was able to recover, i decided to upload this version and start a new project.\u00a0the Song is from bensound.org. The game should be running in this state, sadly i wont be able to update it anymore. Stay tuned for new games and thank you for downloading Drone Gunner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:54:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a4d9ebb3037c9db850f647a73a1abd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lazyday"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
