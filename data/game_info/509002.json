Siege of Azura has multiple 'layers' where you can build traditional towers, but also space ships that move in their respective 'lane'. Try to survive the increasing number of enemy space ships, with any that get through landing their soldiers onto the planet.</p><p>To build towers, click the tower button, and then click on a slot. Most slots start out locked, so you have to purchase them. You can buy ships by clicking on the ship button, and then clicking on the green space lane.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for the AngrySmile Beginner Jam #3 game jam by Ey3saac and GoldenMagikarpz. We consider this game to be in an unfinished but completely playable\u00a0state, but we wanted to be able to submit our game for the jam, and this took priority over adding all the planned features.</p>\n<p>Despite this, we hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Music - Vampire - Emmit Fenn</p>\n<p>Font Used -\u00a0Press Start 2P - CodeMan38</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cb/3cb5132efe07a2b5c92a7d002bfda15e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ey3saac", "GoldenMagikarpz"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
