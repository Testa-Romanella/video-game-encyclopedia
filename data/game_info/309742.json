The Knife is sharpened, That Guy is marked, and the clock is ticking...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:48:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/31e/31e750978aff63806d3a76149bf09b07.jpg", "website": "https://www.indiedb.com/games/knife-that-guy", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Flyover Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
