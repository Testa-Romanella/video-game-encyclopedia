{"id": 104406, "slug": "corvette-jam", "name": "Corvette Jam", "name_original": "Corvette Jam", "description": "<p>A project that began on a dare, Corvette Jam was a challenge to make a game of some kind <strong>within only a week</strong>. Really, the challenge was to make a game at all, but I\u00a0felt I\u00a0needed a deadline in order to force me to actually release something playable.</p>\n<p>While a lot of content and features had to be cut to meet the deadline, the mechanics are there and the end result is a playable game. A game that was made in one week, and a project I'm still proud of completing and ended up being more fun to actually play than I was expecting.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0really do feel like with a only a couple days spent purely on content and polish, without writing in any new features at all, this could actually be a decent game.</p><p><strong>Update:\u00a0I\u00a0released a version of this game with one week extra of polish and content development dubbed Corvette Jam Special Edition</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Features:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fly a space corvette with two mouse aimed turrets</li><li>4 different weapons:\u00a0Cannon, Shotgun, Flak, Grenades</li><li>Fight through waves of enemies to set a high score</li><li>2 types of AI\u00a0piloted ships: Fighters and the Frigate, each with their own flying styles and weapons</li><li>All ships are physics driven through forces and balanced with PID machines</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The ship is very straightforward to fly. It's more like a tank that can go up/down than a space ship.</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move in the horizontal</li><li>Space/L.Ctrl - Move in the vertical</li><li>1/2/3/4 - Weapon select keys</li><li>Left Mouse Button - Fire Guns</li><li>Right Mouse Button - Zoom</li></ul>\n<p>Middle mouse \u00a0will also lock/unlock mouse. This isn't actually a feature, it's a leftover debug option.</p>\n<p>Due to time constraints there are no graphics or control options. There isn't a mouse sensitivity slider. Sorry about that.</p>\n<p><strong>You'll have to either X out of the window, die, or use Alt-F4 to quit because I didn't have time to implement a pause screen while the game is going.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/805199d9e2a0c8db7efbe001db9fa41c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Why485"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
