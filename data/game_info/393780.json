Suprised? Okay, for real, the point of this game is to get a power core out of the play area by pushing it with arrows. However, the arrows cannot be placed in the majority of the play area. There are multiple solutions to the puzzles, so be creative!</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left click = place arrow</li><li>Right click = remove arrow</li><li>A/D = turn arrow</li><li>W/D = adjust tick index</li><li>SPACE = start/pause</li><li>Q = start/reset</li><li>E = single step</li></ul>\n<p>Each arrow moves one tile at the time. The arrow with the lower index moves first.</p>\n<p>An arrow can push other arrows, even multiple at once, but not if one of the pushed arrows arrow is pointing in the opposite direction.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Made by Nicolaj 'Eastvillage' \u00d8sterby at Create Jam 2019 Fall, Aalborg University.</p><p>Music: Infinifactory OST by Matthew S Burns<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T03:11:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca7/ca7ff405991affb6c71151094467db95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eastvillage"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
