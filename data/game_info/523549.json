The chip interacted directly with the neural network of the soldiers and amplified the electrical signals that the brain processed, giving them lightning fast reflexes. Newer installations of the <em>POLLUX </em>microchip augmented the soldiers' abilities even further, allowing them to block their pain receptors and analyze sound waves to triangulate the positions of their enemies.</p>\n<p>However the <em>POLLUX </em>program took a turn when the scientists realized that usage of the chip led to sensory overload and glitches. Many of the Cyborgs went crazy so the government decided to shut down the program.</p>\n<p>During an army raid to the facilities, a prototype Cyborg by the callsign <strong>C - 417</strong> was automatically activated by his microchip and tried to make a run for it.</p>\n<p>You control the Cyborg through these events.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T05:47:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71d/71dd142ac8d561ef1bf9df1b4ac100e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["poorlocke"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
