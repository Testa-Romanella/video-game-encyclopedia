Causing you not to be able to see the final cutscene. If you want to see it, you can watch it on youtube.\u00a0I also uploaded files with (only!) this bug fixed here:\u00a0https://gofile.io/?c=DDKr9O. Proof on GitHub, lol.<br/></p><p>Christmas is coming up, that means that it is time to find the perfect present for your wife; a diamond! Mine for ores in this procedurally generated marching squares world to improve your tools and find precious ores. Find a diamond to complete the game and see the final cutscene.</p>\n<p>My code is horribly unoptimized due to a lack of time so\u00a0the game might take a few seconds to load, especially on WebGL. Controls can be found by pressing the button in the bottom left of the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Yogscast Game Jam 2019\u00a0Submission<br/></strong><strong>Theme: 'Giving'</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0bef08e14cb40fc3f2747e04fc870c93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PseudoBytes"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
