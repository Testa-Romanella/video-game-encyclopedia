{"id": 2778, "slug": "surgeon-simulator-cpr", "name": "Surgeon Simulator", "name_original": "Surgeon Simulator", "description": "<p>Surgeon Simulator is a medical simulation game that makes you a surgeon named Nigel Burke. You need to carry out different operations, firstly on people and later on aliens. Famous for its controls, Surgeon Simulator literally gives you the ability to control your virtual left hand\u2019s fingers with A, W, E, R and Space buttons on your keyboard. The mouse is used to move your hand up and down.<br />\nAs these controls aren&#39;t easy to master, it&#39;s quite hard to carry on the first operations. But the game starts to challenge you from the beginning, offering to operate a patient&#39;s heart, brains, and other important organs. The game&#39;s physics model reacts on every mistake you make with blood rivers and a patient&#39;s death. Because of this Surgeon Simulator became a meme among gamers with videos of its playthroughs gaining thousands of views.</p>", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2013-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:38:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca8/ca840f2a8ebfc74aac1688367dc1f903.jpg", "website": "http://www.surgeonsim.com/", "rating": 3.42, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 113, "owned": 3130, "beaten": 204, "toplay": 35, "dropped": 391, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 282, "ratings_count": 551, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 553, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "iOS", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "Android"], "developers": ["Bossa Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bossa Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
