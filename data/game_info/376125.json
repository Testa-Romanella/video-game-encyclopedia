The simulation actually determines the creatures in the game: their bodies, how they swim, and how they think and behave. All the creatures in the trailer evolved on their own in the game; none were hand-edited!Virtual creatures evolve on their own to adapt to an environment you createAt Ecosystem&#39;s heart are evolving virtual lifeforms, who grow from synthetic DNA and live in a physically-simulated ocean. This synthetic DNA encodes everything about a creature, from skeletal structure to skin, from joint-types to mental processes. The genetic code of a creature can mutate, combine, be spliced with other species, and be directly modified by the player.<br />\nCreatures&#39; nervous systems evolve along with their bodiesCreature brains are also encoded in DNA and subject to evolution. The neurology of a virtual lifeform is a pipeline computer where, every moment, data from sense organs is passed through a network of neurons and finally contracts a muscle in a specific body part.<br />\nMovement is bound by the laws of fishicsTo swim, creatures don&#39;t just play an animation. They move like real sea-life, applying torque at their joints to push against the water in a way coordinated to propel themselves forward. Working within this physical simulation, evolution can produce an enormous variety of body shapes and swimming styles.<br />\nPlay for thousands of hours and never see the same animal twice!A wide variety of different creature populations share a single environment, where they swim, graze, prey on each other, and have children. The fittest creatures pass their genes along to their children, and over time a world of strange and unique creatures is born...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-07T13:43:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f601ddbd64fd063cf74e0ad9c8dbfb76.jpg", "website": "https://ecosystem-game.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Johnson"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Slug Disco Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
