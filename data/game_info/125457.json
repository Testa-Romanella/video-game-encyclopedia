{"id": 125457, "slug": "thrustcut", "name": "THRUST/CUT", "name_original": "THRUST/CUT", "description": "<p>THRUST/CUT is a short prototype for a physics-based dexterity puzzle game made for speedrunning. \u00a0It was \u00a0made by a one-man team in 48 hours during the\u00a0Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam. The theme was \"Dual Purpose Design\".</p>\n<p>In THRUST/CUT you are a flying disc in in 2D space, with a need to cut red ropes.</p>\n<p>Cutting black ropes will break a heart. Break 4 hearts and it's GAME OVER.</p>\n<p><strong>I recommend you play through the game multiple times to get the fastest time\u00a0</strong><strong>of completion (It only takes a minute or two!).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dual Purpose Design:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In\u00a0THRUST/CUT holding the space bar enables THRUST/CUT mode. This enables movement and makes any collisions with ropes cause them to be cut.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This mechanic is used to encourage the player to be deliberate about their movements as taking control makes them a hazard to ropes in their vicinity. However, high level play where a short completion time is desirable rewards risk taking, such as enabling bursts of movement close to ropes or enabling THRUST/CUT while over a rope.</p>\n<p>In addition the main UI elements are dual purpose, conveying intermittent messages to the player.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>SPACE - enable THRUST/CUT mode.</p>\n<p>While in THRUST/CUT mode you can move with ARROW KEYS.</p>\n<p>Any ropes hit while in this mode will be cut.</p>\n<p>ESC - quit game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tips!:</strong></p>\n<p>You will keep your movement momentum when THRUST/CUT mode is disabled.</p>\n<p>Enabling THRUST/CUT mode will only cut ropes if you collide with them. If you are already on top of a rope it will not be cut if you enable THRUST/CUT while in that position.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tools Used:</strong></p>\n<p>Unity 5.6.1f1</p>\n<p>Adobe Photoshop CC</p>\n<p><strong>Source is available\u00a0on github:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>https://github.com/sandeepSH95/Dreamcatcher_GMTKJam2017</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69c/69c55bc52e87e1925bca2730525a93fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoodSandwich"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
