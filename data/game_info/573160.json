Besides fighting in multiple arenas, micromanaging your ludus and gladiators is an important part of the game, which features:<br/><br/><br/>Any skill, armor or weapon is usable by any well-trained gladiator, generating lots of possibilities when it comes to creating new builds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Multiple items and weapons are allowed inside combat, but knowing the best time to use your gear is key if you want to be the champion of the arenas.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>To run a ludus (a gladiator school) you must always pay attention to the economics of your business. Fight to get money and prizes, train your gladiators enough to maintain a solid income and restore the old and abandoned ludus your family left you.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T02:48:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a30/a30a79e0435e650df22db4669ddd958a.jpg", "website": "https://t.co/vxiLllwYFP?amp=1", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Achenar", "Odd Giant"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Odd Giant"], "esrb_rating": null}
