The freeware also supports Lego's robot construction set, the Mindstorms NXT.\r\n<p><em>This file is about to get a big update. When the update is released, the software will also become more expensive, so download it now and save money.<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u00a0After starting LEGO Digital Designer 4.3.11, you can first choose between Lego Factory and Lego Mindstorms. If you are not interested in Lego robots and just want to tinker with Lego bricks, choose the first option.</em></p>\n\n<em>\n<p>After that, you can choose a predefined model or build freely to your heart's content. Without a plan, guided only by your imagination. Models you have started can be saved and continued later. To do this, drag the building blocks onto the work surface while holding down the left mouse button. You can scroll in and out with the mouse wheel. With the right mouse button you can rotate the view, just as you would with a real model.</p>\n<p>Clever: When you have finished your model, you can display the price via the menu \"Display, Determine price\" if you want to rebuild your model with real building blocks.</p>\n</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:38:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/900/90057a10991a4a5e3a65c8fead60e8e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lego Digital Designer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
