Currently it's in a really early state (like REALLY early) still with lots to add and fix, and the current estimated date for the first real build of the game will be around april 2023 or so. The game is about fighting robots on a rooftop while using an upgrade machine to upgrade your main weapons to defeat the enemies faster. Lore will be added aswell in in the finished product.<br/></p>\n<p>Keybinds:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: WASD</li><li>Shoot: Mouse Button 1 (left click)</li><li>Pause Menu: P (will be changed to ESC eventually)</li><li>Interract: F</li><li>(might be some hidden cheat keybinds)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T09:16:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/433/4334b8e2fe49b56f4234c03d90f82a23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GasterWS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
