No one got along better than these two catgirls when they were younger, but lately, they&#39;ve been fighting all the time.<br />\nDespite their sisterly love, a small misunderstanding ends up driving a wedge between them. As the story of these catgirl sisters unfolds, they&#39;ll grow to understand each other and strengthen their familial bonds in this heartfelt catgirl comedy, which is only a little lewd. Now open for business!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-25T11:56:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d41/d4188b34e71babfed6d510268b86404d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.51, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 51, "owned": 551, "beaten": 56, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 9, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 69, "suggestions_count": 463, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["NEKO WORKs", "CFK CO"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sekai Project", "CFK"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
