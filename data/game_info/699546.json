The whole time, my only goal was to actually finish it and upload it on itch. Unlike my other (failed) projects, I kept it very, very simple and was able to do it!</p>\n\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>You are the blue Icon.png at the bottom. Use the left and right arrow keys to move, and the space bar to shoot. Enemies (Red Icon.png's) spawn at random intervals that get shorter over time. They move downwards until they reach your level, where you lose. Shoot them, and they die. Simple.</p>\n<p>Font: JosefinSans</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T06:24:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aac/aacd88aa4f9660b1a80f15506ba9118d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SupercraftD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
