I am color blind... One day When I saw my daughter holding the 3D-printed moai, I suddenly realized that the moai was gray! That is a good color for me. You will see other colors in the painting because I use color code to draw each color, so I still don't know what color I painted on PixelMoais.\r\n</p>\n<p>I simulated the PixelMoai world of different color blind people. For non-color blind people, the moai retains its original color while the surrounding changes. But through the eyes of a color-blind person, all the color remains the same.\r\n</p>\n<p>1~2000 : Normal\r\n</p>\n<p>2001~4000 : Achromatopsia\r\n</p>\n<p>4001~6000 : Protanopia\r\n</p>\n<p>6001~8000 : Deuteranopia\r\n</p>\n<p>8001~10000 : Tritanopia\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you will find the one you like.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:27:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/010/010a3ab76f1bcf6c8de709849f4919b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pixelmoai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
