In <em>Possessions</em>, you play as a restless spirit, wandering from neighborhood to neighborhood and home to home,\u00a0possessing the residents therein, and messing with their relationships however suits your fancy. Why? Gotta pass time in the afterlife somehow.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li><strong>30 inventive levels</strong> of brain-scratching, spectral\u00a0fun across 5 spooky neighborhoods</li><li>Highly original program-manipulating gameplay</li><li>A challenge score for each level\u00a0that only the best possessors can achieve</li></ul>\r\nPossessing You Say?\r\n<p>In each level, your goal is to alter a given relationship\u00a0between two mortals by a certain amount. (For example, let's say you want to get the relationship between Mom &amp;\u00a0Dad up to five.)\u00a0Your otherworldly prescience gives you the ability to see what these mortals are going to do before they do it. (Looks like Mom is in the hall and is\u00a0planning on going to the Garage and Dad is in the kitchen\u00a0planning on making dinner.)\u00a0To accomplish your goal, you'll need\u00a0to do some possessing and alter one of their plans. (Maybe you possess Mom so that she goes to the kitchen instead to see the delicious meal Dad is making, thus improving their relationship.)</p>\n<p>But not so fast! You can lose a level if any relationship other than your goal changes by too much. (All the while, Son is planning on going to the study and will see that Mom is writing him out of the will! Do you deter him from that course or keep to your plan of redirecting Mom?)\u00a0It is these kinds of agonizing decisions and madcap situations that make every level of <em>Possessions</em> an absolute delight.</p>\r\nInstall Instructions<ul><li>You can sideload\u00a0<em>Possessions</em>\u00a0via\u00a0Panic's official instructions here.\r\n</li><li>You can download to PC/Mac and play Possessions in the Playdate Simulator, included in\u00a0the Playdate SDK.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game by Mick Johnson</p>\n<p>Art by Eve Moroyoqui (Dark Elf Dungeon)</p>\n<p>Additional Art by\u00a0Mick Johnson &amp; Aimee Venot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T15:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d33/d33b7a50abce00e49be9e770a56e17cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkElfDungeon", "mickajohnson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
