When he woke up, he met the holy bird Hoopoe, his future guide, for the first time.<br/><br/>Besides his ability to speak with animals, with this dream, King Solomon became aware of the puissance of the ring, which was given to him by God to rule over the 4th dimension creatures.<br/><br/>A convention with the attendance of 25 jinn clans took place at King Solomon\u2019s castle located at the Mount of Zion.

In order to take possession of King Solomon's ring and subjugate all the 4th dimension beings, he swore to eradicate King Solomon and every last one of his descendants.<br/> <br/>King Solomon used the wisdom of the book, Kenz-ul Havas, to create a strong incantation for taking his former descendants under protection and ensured with a chest to pass on this wisdom from generation to generation.<br/> <br/>Bir-un Shatan abused four of the clan leaders for his own interests, who formerly refused to be dominated by King Solomon and were inhibited to change dimension.<br/> <br/><strong>1955 - Village of Parlak</strong><br/><br/>The last soldiers of King Solomon\u2019s ancestry, Hafiz and his grandson Dai, settled in an Anatolian village near Izmir called Parlak, in the light of the wisdom acquired from the chest.<br/> <br/>The Ministry of Culture starts an archaeological excavation after the village\u2019s children find a jug filled with hundreds of gold coins.
