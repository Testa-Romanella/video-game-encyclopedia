And then  you need to go to the toilet but you simply can't because you are  frozen with fear. You are expecting monsters in the closet. Ghosts in  the drawing room.\u00a0 This game is the same. It recreates a few of those  childhood fears in a very weird dream sequence. <br/></p>\n<p>Contact : ShambaC#3440<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T09:19:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/270/2701c3a3cc6db0a15a0a85ebfd95d3e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ISOLATIONMEDIA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
