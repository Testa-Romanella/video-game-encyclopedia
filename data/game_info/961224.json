We are proud to announce that our tower defense game \u2018Moonbeam\u2019 has now landed on the Steam platform!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game, you will enter a magical world made up of sun birds and ice cream. In this world, you will need to use careful analysis and strategic placement of various weapons to experience the fun of defeating enemies and gaining resources.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter a long period of development and testing, we believe that \u2018Moonlight\u2019 will bring you a brand new tower defense game experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the game, we have designed five different types of weapons, including:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRainbow Blaster: responsible for attacking and defeating enemies.<br/>\r\nStink Stick: responsible for slowing down enemies and releasing poison gas.<br/>\r\nFrost Flyer: responsible for collecting energy.<br/>\r\nStrawberry: although it cannot destroy enemies, it can cause permanent damage to them.<br/>\r\nSky Fortress: can launch trackers that make the attack power of other weapons double, which is a powerful tool for efficiently killing enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe idea of the game is \"You have to kill the enemy near the Frost Flyer to gain energy\", which seems simple, but requires the right combination of each weapon to do it, which is very challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur development team has been working hard to improve this game. Prior to its release, we conducted extensive game testing to make necessary improvements and adjustments to enhance the game\u2019s quality and fun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe firmly believe that \u2018Moonbeam\u2019 is an outstanding tower defense game, and we hope players can try new challenges and stories and enjoy new game experiences through this game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThank you for your support!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T02:30:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b38/b3857eb357637f94199e5b81d6771091.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["LiuXiaoFan"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LiuXiaoFan"], "esrb_rating": null}
