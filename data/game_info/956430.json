They want to show them the horrors of slaughterhouses, but don't want to traumatize their children. I created this interactive video to allow parents to have a foothold when talking to their kids about why some animals are viewed by and large as pets while others are viewed as food. The game brings up the topic of speciesism, why antispeciesism is important, and where children and parents can go for more information. This one video alone is not enough to completely inform children about antispeciesism, but it can provide a talking point for parents who would otherwise be unsure of how to bring up the topic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5af/5af885156f47776243c296c3914e6bf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LaAdelita"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
