But there\u2019s a catch The longer you\r\nplay the game the more items will start flying in your direction from\r\nboth sides and it\u2019ll become harder for you to dodge them. So\r\nbasically it starts off slow but it\u2019ll gradually become faster to\r\nthe point that there wont be any success at the end, because it\u2019s\r\nto see how long you can survive for. </p>\n<p>Game\r\noutline: it\u2019s simple you\u2019re a figure of some kind that is just on\r\na simple map, nothing too crazy. You start off being able to jump\r\naround to get a feel for it then it\u2019ll tell you that it\u2019s\r\nstarting. As soon as it\u2019s starting the\r\ngame, the objects will begin to come across from both sides of the\r\nmap. There wouldn\u2019t be too much to add to the game, maybe some\r\npercs you could acquire randomly on the game that would slow down the\r\nobjects for a period of time when they come in faster. Also maybe a\r\nperc that clears the map of all objects giving that sense of relief\r\nfor a little bit before they start flying again. The goal is to be\r\nsimple yet a challenging game. </p>\n<p>USP:</p>\n<p>-\r\nFigure that jumps around.</p>\n<p>-\r\nObjects fly across both sides of the map.<br/></p>\n<p>-\r\ndon\u2019t stop jumping</p>\n<p>-\r\nsurvive</p>\n<p>inspiration/\r\nsimilar games</p>\n<p>Flappy\r\nBird/ Crossy Roads<br/></p>\n<p>Edit to the game:Jump around is a simple prototype that I came up with where the object of the game is simple. You jump around and dodge the enemies randomly flying around with a health system of 3. I know how it says points, don't pay any attention to that it would most likely be added when going back to it for making the game a little more interesting. I ended up putting an enemy that does higher damage than the other one so it should be easier to spot out and hopefully it works. Over all you just need to survive and have fun..good luck.\u00a0 Original document is still the same, this is just an added on description to the prototype. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T05:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d967f825e8251e632b9bc74eb5115f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bigsean109"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
