The game grid is composed of hundreds of hexagons, each of which has an attached timer that starts at a random value. When the timer goes to zero, a dangerous block falls on the square, killing the player instantly. Avoid getting trapped in enclosed chambers of blocks, and your time will increase substantially!</p>\n<p><strong>Is it customizable?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, it is! In the \"Change Colours\" menu, you can not only set your colour scheme to one of nine colour presets, but you can mix your own colours with the interactive colour pickers! In addition, in the \"Settings\" menu, you can change countdown speed and maximum starting number. Avoid putting this too high, otherwise, the game might take years to finish. Press \"Reset\" in either menu if you wish to put the game back to factory settings.</p>\n<p><strong>What Game Engine was this created on?</strong></p>\n<p>Unity 2018.2.2f1 Personal.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix Log</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1.0.1 - Original</p>\n<p>1.0.2 - Fixed black screen glitch</p>\n<p>1.0.3 - Fixed black color setter glitch, added browser version</p>\n<p><strong>1.0.4 - Properly fixed black color setter glitch, added \"Reset PlayerPrefs Button\", and added Game Icon for Windows and Linux builds\u00a0<em>(Current for WebGL, Windows, and Linux)</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0d1a78d3239a9045a76df4c4a4841bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mertios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
