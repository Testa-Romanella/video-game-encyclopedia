This is my first game that I have ever completed entirely and for the most part all by myself, including the creation of all the resources from scratch.</p>\n<p>I apologize for any errors you may be encountering while playing the game - I still had a lot of ideas for the game and a lot of things to improve, but due to time constraint I had to finish and upload it. Hope you enjoy it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T04:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8a/b8aa8aca1d202ac03fc33bd45659d8cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CroSnake"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
