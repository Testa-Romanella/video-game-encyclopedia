I probably won't come back to fix anything unless it's a game breaking glitch cause I'm just tired of working on this, honestly whether people come to hate or like this game I'm just glad i actually released something. Anyway have a happy Halloween!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T07:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28dcc3ddcfa26974e7792954b7b16b22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["h0rrid-gemst0ne"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
