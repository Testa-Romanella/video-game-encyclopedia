Buy articles and connect them together to create new posts. Not all connections are completely true, but as long you keep making money who really cares. It's not like one blog can really make a difference.\u00a0</p><p>HOW TO PLAY:\u00a0</p><p>step 1: buy articles:</p><p>The first three tabs (hot takes, the keeper, and daily news) are newspapers that will publish new articles each day. Look at the headlines and click the ones you want to buy.\u00a0</p><p>Step 2: combine articles\u00a0</p><p>Once you bought articles you can see which ones will connect to create a new post. Go to the \"my blog\" tab. At the bottom left you will see the articles you bought. Drag them into the two slots (grayed out post-its) and if there is a connection it will appear in the area to the left. There you can select it (there can be multiple connections) and hit publish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made in a week for Brackey's Game Jam.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming: Fiabot\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Design:\u00a0SulSuli</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0mintel19</p>\n<p>Sound:\u00a0\u00a0University of Games,\u00a0cabled_mess</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0\u00a0Cyberleaf Studio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T22:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f2/4f2bd7bf331e090da23bd584ec5c1044.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fiabot", "SulSuli", "Mintel19"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
