It follows the same plot and wherever possible I maintained the text (and typos) exactly. I did have to take liberties to make it work, but I don't think 12 year old May will mind too much...</p>\n<p>Art for Hawkmon and her various levels of digivolution was made by the amazing Chisai236 who you can find on her tumblr, http://tumblr.com/blog/chisai236.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art for other characters, items and backgrounds and scripting using the Ren'py visual novel engine was done by myself. You can find me on my tumblr, http://tumblr.com/blog/steviepatamon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All music and sound effects are from http://freesound.org where you can get free sound. It's pretty nifty.</p>\n<p>And of course, a massive thank you to May and Jay for creating an incredible podcast, Lost In Translationmon which you can find at https://lostintranslationmon.com.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this fun project we've been working on, and please let us know if you enjoy it so we know that people want to see more chapters in future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7e/e7ec312619d2404c33a8a8b1644d54e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SteviePatamon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
