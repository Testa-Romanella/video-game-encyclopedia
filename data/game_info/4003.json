Money is not needed, the main thing is to conquer the audience. The race will be held in such places as Paris, Hong Kong, Chicago, Dubai, etc. All the tracks, drivers, teams, cars and sponsors in the game are real.</p>\n<p>Compared to GRID (the first part of the series), there are more modes. There were races on the so-called &quot;Checkpoint&quot;,  endurance race and other several options. And the significant thing now that there is no driving on the rails, sudden acceleration of rivals and unpunished wiping of bumpers (also, damage to the machine is not displayed on the screen, it is necessary to focus on its behaviour and the replica of racing engineer).</p>\n<p>The main feature of GRID is time rewinding. The number of rewinds is limited, but with this, you can save yourself from a fatal outcome.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2013-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T20:22:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/27b/27b02ffaab6b250cc31bf43baca1fc34.jpg", "website": "http://www.gridgame.com/", "rating": 3.3, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 423, "owned": 6224, "beaten": 240, "toplay": 64, "dropped": 401, "playing": 32}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 170, "ratings_count": 810, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 811, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "Codemasters"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
