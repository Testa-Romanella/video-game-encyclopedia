But you've an advantage that no one else who tried has: the inability to drown.<br/></p>\n<p>A platformer made over the course of approximately 5 days for KaijuJam 2, with an emphasis on underwater movement and combat. It was originally meant to be more of a traditional Metroidvania, but there wasn't enough time to implement branching paths and upgrades.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>(All controls are explained in-game)<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys <em>or</em> WASD - Move. (Up and down only used in the water.)</li><li>Z\u00a0<em>or</em> Space - Jump. Jump while suspended in water to float, and while floating to sink back to the ground.</li><li>X <em>or</em> Left Click - Attack. While floating, the direction of the attack is influenced by your movement direction.</li><li>Shift <em>or</em> Right Click - Dash. While floating, you can dash in any of the 8 directions.</li></ul>\r\nNotes\r\n<ul><li>There is no ending screen. Once you defeat Leviathan, you're done. (This is why I marked this project as prototype instead of complete - the frame of the game is not quite there.)</li><li>There is a bug within Godot where polygons attached to skeletal animations may not be culled correctly. I didn't manage to find a workaround in time, so sometimes character pieces (especially for larger characters) may flicker at the edges of the screen.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T08:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e6d7a89ca268c90b05d261817501a66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Amorphous"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
