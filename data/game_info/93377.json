PLAY A WHILE, GO MAD FOREVER!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>And so you think you will succeed where everybody else has failed. I, <strong>Huenison</strong>, the Evil Master in charge of the conquest of your world, will see to it that you fail miserably.<br/>\r\n\tYes, conquest.<br/>\r\n\tWhy? Because.<br/>\r\n\tUnfair? Who cares. But enough, I am not wasting further time here. Go away. Or, if you're really serious about it, come down into my deep Mind Control Wells and... die.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>WHAT IS THIS?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Huenison</strong> is an innovative arcade shooter that takes various elements from <strong>Arkanoid</strong>, <strong>BOH</strong>, <strong>Decathlon</strong>, <strong>Dyna Blaster</strong>, <strong>Impossible Mission</strong>, <strong>Oil's Well</strong>, <strong>Pac-Man</strong>, <strong>Pang</strong>, <strong>Qix</strong>, <strong>Slam Tilt</strong>, <strong>Space Invaders</strong>, <strong>Tetris</strong>, and <strong>Vital Light</strong>, and puts them together in a hectic mix. All in retro visuals and synthetic sonorities that recall the revered <strong>Commodore 64</strong>'s <strong>SID</strong> chip.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou shoot at falling <em>bricks</em> with a <em>cannon</em> at the bottom of a <em>well</em> (and no, you haven't ever seen anything like this before). Your beams hit bricks only when they are of the <em>same color</em>. Hitting a brick produces a <em>specific effect</em> depending on the <em>type of the brick</em>. Missing bricks will let them accumulate at the bottom of the well, raising the <em>ground</em> where the cannon rests - and, on top of that, bringing the <em>deadly zapper</em> down, closer to the cannon.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBut this is just the beginning: each level plays differently, more and more brick types are introduced along the way, occasional <em>disturbances</em> will suddenly bring some more chaos, and lots of <em>bonuses</em> will help catch a breath (and score more points)!<br/>\r\n\tIt's a unique experience that can't be described with words. Just dive into <strong>Huenison</strong>'s <em>Mind Control Wells</em>, defeat him, and save the world!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>FEATURES</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>immediate and addictive gameplay</li>\n<li>25 levels</li>\n<li>9 game modes</li>\n<li>huge variety of bricks and bonuses</li>\n<li><strong>C64</strong>-style music, speech, and sounds</li>\n<li>many cool graphic modes</li>\n<li>exciting prog-SID soundtrack</li>\n<li>online hiscores</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>DISCOVER MORE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPlay <strong>Huenison</strong> on  (every customer gets a key).<br/>\r\n\tCheck out the online hiscores.<br/>\r\n\tRead the beautiful manual.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PHYSICAL EDITION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nIn 2018, <strong>Huenison</strong> received a gorgeous physical release:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you are interested in this item, please send an email to huenison@retream.com.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMINIMUM: 500 MHz CPU, 32 bit graphics card, 16 bit sound card, 16 MB RAM, 40 MB disk, 32 bit binaries support, <strong>AmigaOS 4.1</strong>, <strong>Windows XP</strong><br/>\r\n\tRECOMMENDED: 800 MHz CPU, internet<br/>\r\n\tOPTIONAL: joypad\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THE SAGA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Huenison</strong> is part of a saga that, as of writing, includes five different games.<br/>\n<strong>BOH</strong> opens the story, with the <strong>Evil Masters</strong> bringing chaos to <strong>Earth</strong>. <strong>Huenison</strong> focuses on the fight against one of them, the eponymous character. Eventually the Evil Masters were repelled, but, as seen in <strong>QUOD INIT EXIT IIm</strong>, during their retreat, Huenison and his companions happened to pass by planet <strong>Suinio</strong> and decided to cause trouble there as well. In <strong>MAH</strong>, years later, the danger came from the <strong>Apocalypser</strong>, the weapon that had been developed against the Evil Masters and that the <strong>Purifiers</strong> activated to destroy the Earth. Finally, <strong>KOG</strong> assigns a new task to the hero who turned the Apocalypser off.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c4/3c49b5682f8cc2308ff4362d4e973ac0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RETREAM"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
