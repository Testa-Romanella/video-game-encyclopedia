At least the main part of the game was done, so i think. Now its back on development again! with currently 2 puzzle to solve somewhat quite easy to navigate. This release is basically a graphic overhaul before I start crafting some more better puzzles.</p><p>Inspired by games like Myst, Syberia and XON episode 1. Currently under development and is targeted for mobile platform.</p><p>Not every play through will be the same.\u00a0</p><p>Hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5f/f5fbb55f8f261890dd61529ac6f173df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["irgamer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
