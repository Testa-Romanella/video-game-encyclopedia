We basically just used their concept and made a standalone game out of that. We are in no way associated with SuperTrinity and their project.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a49f227f7b60731faea5612e0cba6cb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hertzole"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
