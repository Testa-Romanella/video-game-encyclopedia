Input", "description": "<p>BEFORE STARTING, I'd like to acknowledge that many of the assets used to make this game are not my creation, such as the animations and the 3D models. Every piece of code present in the game however, is my creation, and the focus of this game jam in the first place.<br/></p><p>With that out of the way...<br/></p><p>The premise of this game is: it is a regular hack and slash with platformer mechanics with a big twist - all the inputs to control the character are randomly generated for each iteration of the run. \r\n</p>\n<p>Hence, you will need to PERSEVERE through a control scheme that is working against you. A fight against yourself.</p>\n<p>This is a game I have been meaning to create for a while, and it is quite personal to me. I first had the idea when having a play session of Need for Speed (EA please don't sue me) with my father. The port for the PC was quite rough in terms of porting quality, and the control scheme was completely broken. After digging around the internet for hours, I found out the reason was because the controller I was using was competing for control of the game with my mouse and keyboard. </p>\n<p>I ended up fixing it by MANUALLY unbinding each key that controls the game with the keyboard and mouse, so that they wouldn't input anything against the controller.</p>\n<p>Long story short, I came up with the idea of creating a game where the inputs are deliberately trying to mess with you by binding them incorrectly.</p>\n<p>Although incredibly frustrating for me and my father at the time, I appreciate the experience of battling against a videogame's own mechanisms of enabling play. \u00a0</p>\n<p>I'd also like to quickly thank my father and mother for always supporting me in my pursuit of a career in games. Had it not been for their confidence that I would succeed, perhaps I wouldn't have made this in the first place... </p>\n<p>Good luck! You WILL need it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T22:51:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44b/44bc768ea93435be6b7e7f7acf647c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ionatan B Maghidman"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
