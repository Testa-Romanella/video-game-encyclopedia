ADDS 'NEO MODE' AND OTHER CHANGES! PATCH NOTES IN DOWNLOAD AND AVAILABLE HERE!</strong><br/></em></p><p><em>Nutshack But Its a Game</em> <strong>SHOULD</strong> explain everything you need to know, but I guess there's some confusion or something. To elaborate: The opening sequence to the \"\"\"\"\"\"hit\"\"\"\"\"\" animated Myx television series <em>The Nutshack</em> will play, but EVERY instance of the word \"Nutshack\" spoken in the opening sequence is replaced with the next level (yes, even when the white guy says it). This means there is a level for every \"Nutshack\", and they say \"Nutshack\" a lot.<br/></p><p>The game itself is a platformer, played in the first-person perspective. Can you run, crouch, jump, and stumble your way to the end(s)? Yeah, that's right. There's multiple endings; a <em>Nut</em> Ending, a <em>Shack</em> Ending, and a <em>It's The</em> Ending (which is the game over screen, which you won't miss). There's also secrets and shit, so good luck with that.</p><p>Featuring fan-favorites like Phil from the Frisco, Tito \"Dickman\" Dick, King Dedede, Robbie Rotten, and MAYBE Mr. Rental, and more (I think). There's also a soundtrack comprised mostly of stolen music and high-quality rips (glorified stolen music), but there's also original (partially stolen) music created just for the game, as well as some fan-favorites from <em><strong>Christmas Satellite</strong></em>. Legends say that the theme song to the show <em>The Nutshack</em> also makes an appearance.</p><p><em>\"It's like an entire season of The Nutshack, but as a game\" - </em>Jesse Hernandez, <em>Nutshack</em> Co-Creator<br/></p><p><em>\"The quality far exceeded my expectations -- Cody's follow-up to the excellent 'Christmas Satellite' is challenging, charming, and based on a meme I only quarter-understand.\" </em>- PCgamer<br/></p><p><em>\"What.

Fuck.\" </em>- <em>Patreon</em> Donor</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6a2ccf72bd0d777ab218ea93e5c76c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Codybean1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
