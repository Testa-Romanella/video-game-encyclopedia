However the zombie army has obtained a new power from the teralact crystal: they can\u2019t be injured while in the darkness. Our hero Johnny Biker must think on his feet by using matches that burn out after 10 seconds and the lightning that flashes every 10 seconds (that\u2019s two 10 seconds okay) in order to take out his enemies.
