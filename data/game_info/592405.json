Employment is high. Everyone is happy, successful, and filled with civic pride. I\u2019ll bet your city has spent a lot of money telling you it\u2019s true.</em></p>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t believe it. Scratch the surface, and you will find the truth. That businessman\u2019s cheating on his wife. That politician\u2019s snorting cocaine. That cop\u2019s taking bribes to look the other way. No one is clean. Everyone has a secret, and most will do anything to keep their secrets safe. Even murder.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>But secrets have a way of getting out, and bodies don\u2019t stay buried forever.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Welcome to\u00a0<em>Dirty Secrets</em>. In this game, you and a few friends will create stories of corruption, betrayal, deception, and murder, all set in your own home town. Together, you will guide a single investigator through a complex web of lies, corruption, and murder as he pursues that most elusive prey: the truth.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you like the hardboiled genre and roleplaying games, this is a must buy. Seth gets the genre, and he has created the first RPG that really lets the players experience it properly. People will be designing games that are heavily influenced by it for a long time to come.\u201d \u2013Gerald Cameron,\u00a0MyPlay\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T09:24:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a48/a48cff14b6e8b15d7ccf5fe22c1af2c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seth Ben-Ezra"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
