It has a rigidbody that allows it to collide with normal cubes present upon the plane. The physics applied to cubes can be strong enough to launch them into the air. It was built from a capsule body that was greatly reduced in height. Users can move it beyond the plane without it falling since gravity is disabled for the puck.\r\n</p>\n<p>3) Launch Cube Projectile\r\n</p>\n<p>Users will be able to spawn a red \"projectile cube\" that will fall towards the present location of the puck. Users will have time to move the puck out of the way. The spawn button for this is E.\r\n</p>\n<p>4) Destroyer Puck\r\n</p>\n<p>If the projectile cubes collide with the puck, they are immediately destroyed. This applies to projectile cubes that are present on the ground. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Previous Documentation:\r\n</p>\n<p>This app is a game where the user is able to press spacebar and spawn cubes for as long as they are pressing spacebar. On the side, they have two sliders. One can change the scale of the cubes and the other the color of the cubes produced from dark to light. Once a cube is spawned, a countdown starts which destroys the cube once it reaches zero.\r\n</p>\n<p>Note: Cube size starts at zero, so no visible cubes will be produced if the scale slider is not increased.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T07:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08b/08b20a44626c32f512ee28e3d2568778.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rickyhernandez1000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
