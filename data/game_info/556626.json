It was made in ~48 hours for Global Games Jam 2021 using Gamemaker Studio 2. The theme for the jam was \"Lost and Found\". The design is very simple given the short timeframe. The player has to find the cabochon that was left behind by the character's grandfather. Once you play this game once, you likely won't play it again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:26:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4f/e4f139038a50b8990a077fe8168f23b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kafele Palmer-Hunt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
