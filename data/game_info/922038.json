{"id": 922038, "slug": "ca-root", "name": "Ca-Root", "name_original": "Ca-Root", "description": "<p>Influenced by a famous TV show from our childhood, Ca-Root is a comedy puzzle game that relies on visual and cultural cues. In Ca-Root, the player through the host character helps the participants reconnect with their loved ones and get back to their roots. Each round a participant provides hints which includes visual cues and/or cultural knowledge. Then the player is given a list of options and has to pick the correct answer based on the information they have. If they find the correct answer they move onto the next round, if they fail they lose a life and have to pick again. If the player solves all 4 rounds without losing 3 lives they will beat the game! Otherwise, they will face a Game Over screen. Ca-Root is a love letter to an era we consider our Roots as the developer team, and includes many nods to it. We hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T03:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ea/9ea4ef273ed8359dae2d255df48ed7ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["celik97", "Can Deniz \u00c7am", "melisdilisen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
