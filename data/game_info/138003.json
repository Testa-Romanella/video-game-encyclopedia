It\u2019s a laid back excursion into the serene and dreamlike environment where you are Sarah, a little girl in search of all the pages to her book. She must collect all the pages on each level to advance to the next. There are optional items to collect, including outfits. If Sarah is lost and needs a little help, she can gather a few crystals strewn about the level to activate the compass. It will point her to the next objective. There are no monsters or brain teasing puzzles in this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbb752522139fc4b30dd60dfadbd1541.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lumatap"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
