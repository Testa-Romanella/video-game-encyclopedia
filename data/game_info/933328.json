Controls below:</p>\n<p>Arrows or WASD to Move. Hold Q to hide in the snow. Hold Left Shift to sprint. Press the Space Bar to eat. ALT+F4 to exit.</p>\n<p>The music is all by me and my pal. Ignore the dude talking in the background if you make it to the win screen, I was bored in a zoom class lmao</p>\n<p>There are so many things I wanted to add, but didn't have the time to get to before the submission deadline. The big one is procedural level generation and multiple levels. Right now its just a sample level with 50 enemies, but I had plans to make them spawn in from one of many pre-made sections.</p>\n<p>There are lots of other things I would add if I ever go back and work on this game more: -effects like blood, footprints, screenshake. -more things in the environment to interact with like snow drifts to hide in or things to throw to make distractions. -some sort of timing or scoring system -better menu screens and a tutorial</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T09:00:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68a/68a38d7b6cbba7c425396cb89811945f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jesse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
