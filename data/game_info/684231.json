The breathing system was a mechanic I've wanted to play around with for a while, and a spooky game seemed like the perfect opportunity to try it out. The game ended up needing more work than expected to meet my full vision for it, so I decided to just make it a simple walking sim where you can enjoy a dark forest while playing around with the mechanic. I heavily relied on prebuilt assets, but the game put together entirely by myself. Enjoy!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T07:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e27c22feb1aff10108dd01446bf7c2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bckramer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
