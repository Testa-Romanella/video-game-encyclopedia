{"id": 814717, "slug": "rhythm-beach", "name": "Rhythm Beach", "name_original": "Rhythm Beach", "description": "<p>This is a Rhythm\u00a0Fishing game a la Stardew Valley and Rhythm Doctor.</p>\n<p>The current state of the demo is that the arcade is functional, and the overworld has bugs and test environments.</p>\r\nNarrative\r\n<p>A little fuddy-duddy seaside fishing port has long forgotten the tune of the sea. Since the days sirens faded to myth, the aging population of old sea dogs and cats have settled into rote repetition, catching and selling fish at the same faded beat.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You needed a change from the fast-paced world of the big city, and decided to buy a sea-side home you saw for sale on the net. It was advertised as a \u201cbeautiful ocean-view, with the smell of the ocean coming in through the windows.\u201d When you arrived, you find it to be misadvertised; Yes, all those things are there, but what they /didn\u2019t/ tell you is that it\u2019s basically an outhouse and the walls are barely-stuck-together planks and nails. The roof leaks as the ocean spray springs in. Thankfully, the local Dockmaster gives you an opportunity: Catch fish, sell them to him, and he\u2019ll give you a good sum.\r\n</p>\n<p>Further exploration of the seaside town has you encountering a Researcher investigating the rhythmic phenomenon, who tasks you with filling out a journal of all the new and altered species. Apparently, the Goddesses\u2019 blessing is also a curse, and has mutated all the local species. Not only can the other local fishers not catch their normal fish, they\u2019re having trouble figuring out the new Rhythm of the Sea to reel them in.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nGame Elements\r\n<p>You can move around in a top-down RPG world akin to Stardew. The area is relatively small, and focused on the beachfront and river accesses with a small town area where you can say hi to a few NPCs and a beachside area where you can sell your fish. You also have a very small fishing shack interior, and a freezer (inventory) where your fish are stored.\r\n</p>\n<p>For v1, we are focused entirely on making a functional game ONLY in the beachfront setting.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are three types of items. One is fish, which have a name, price, size and rarity attached to them. The others are fishing rod, bait, and hook. You can use money from selling fish to get new upgrades to these items.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T13:23:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/735/7352b185873296f35e22293c45d2ed64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orionhart"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
