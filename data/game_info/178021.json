I planned on adding a final boss that was unlocked after completing the others, but I didn't have any ideas and I ran out of time, so the 3 battles are all you get.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tLike with all my games, I have been unable to test Mac &amp; Linux versions, but I think they work. If you run into any problems, telling me will really help!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGround texture is from \r\n\tthis assetstore package.
