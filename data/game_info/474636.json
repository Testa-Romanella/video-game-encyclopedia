Help him gather ingredients, perform the ritual, and discover the truth behind the myth.<br/></p>\n<p>Supposedly, one can summon an entity known as the \"Bus Man\" by placing a plate with a tuna salad sandwich and a glass of water at any metro bus stop between midnight and 3:00 am (very similar to setting out cookies and a glass of milk to dunk them in on Christmas eve). No one who has entered the bus has returned to tell the tale of what horrors lie within.</p>\n<p>No one knows exactly who or what this mysterious being is (if he is real at all). Some speculate that he is simply a bus driver who never returned to the metro center. Others suppose he is something not from this world.\u00a0 Some say that he was once a man, but--driven by madness or tragedy--he built himself into the bus, becoming part man and part machine.</p>\n<p>I guess you'll just have to find out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:42:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a40f76fba46b37365dfed8ba9c0860ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ianrh2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
