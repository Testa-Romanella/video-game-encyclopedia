Chrome and Safari and a few others have a chance to not load. Edge always works for me.\r\nIt's highly recommended to play the downloaded version of the game, as the WebGL version is <strong>very </strong>slow <strong>and laggy. Your enjoyment of the game will be degraded on the Web build. While loading the game on the website version of the game, you may get a message saying the page had stopped responding, just keep clicking \u201cwait\u201d until it loads.</strong>\n<strong>Addressing ambiguities in the tutorial:</strong>\n<strong>- You can only equip a block and craft while in build mode</strong>\n<strong>- You can only place and destroy blocks while in build mode</strong>\n<strong>- The inventory must be closed to interact with terrain</strong>\n<strong>- You can only move people about while in People Mode</strong><strong>- In the tutorial, there is a person inside the house above you. You can click on people through walls to claim/select them.</strong><strong>- To claim a person, one of your people must walk up to them<br/><br/></strong>\n<p>Cubie is a game about uniting people together, whom all of which are stranded on floating islands! Can you bridge across to other people? After all, we're stronger together!</p>\n\n\n<p>Please be sure to play the in-game tutorial. I know we all love to skip it, but it'll help you understand a lot.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Rotate camera</li><li>Hold left click and drag - Move camera focus point by pan</li><li>Scroll Wheel - Zoom</li><li>Q - Cycle through modes<ul><li>Build Mode<ul><li>Left click to build</li><li>Right click to destroy</li></ul></li><li>Extend Mode<ul><li>Double click a block to select it</li><li>Drag spheres outwards to bridge</li><li>You must have enough blocks in your inventory to build</li></ul></li><li>People Mode<ul><li>Click a claimed person to toggle their selected state</li><li>Click somewhere for all people in your selection group to add that location as a target.</li><li>Click an unclaimed person as a target, and have a claimed person walk over to them to claim them.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>E - Open inventory<ul><li>Double click an item in inventory to equip it (Must be in build mode)</li></ul><ul><li>Double click a crafting recipe in inventory to craft\u00a0(Build mode)</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Brackey's 2021 Game Jam under the theme Stronger Together.
