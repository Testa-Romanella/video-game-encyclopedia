You will play as a Ukrainian military drone operator who fights enemy forces, salvages valuable equipment, and restores crucial communication lines disrupted by the conflict.<br/><br/>But that's not all. What sets Death From Above apart is that it's not just a game but also a means to make an impact!  <br/>30% of the net proceeds will be equally split between two Ukrainian organizations supporting non-offensive aid to the Ukrainian Armed forces: <strong>Come Back Alive</strong> and <strong>Army of Drones</strong>. This way, you can feel confident that your purchase contributes to a worthy cause. Once we\u2019ve broken even on the game, we will increase this contribution, sending 70% of our net revenues to these good causes. The remaining 30% will be invested in further developing the game.<h3>Key Features:</h3><ul><li><strong>Interplay between operator and Drone</strong><br/><br/>After you deplete your drone's ammo, you must return to your operator's position to rearm.

It\u2019s a conscious decision to engage with a difficult issue that directly affects millions of people's lives<strong> in Ukraine and beyond</strong>, a decision that some might see as controversial. <br/>While we embrace controversy and difficult conversations, <strong>we don\u2019t believe in controversy for its own sake or the sake of sales</strong>. We engage in these topics because we are convinced they are important and that the power of video games can be a tool for political and social activism. <strong>Death From Above</strong> is no exception to that. <br/>Additionally, we\u2019re proud to help spread this message of support for Ukraine\u2019s defense<br/><br/><strong>Are you ready to help Ukraine and make Death from Above the best game it can be? </strong><br/>If you want to help us or even become a part of the project, now is the best time to reach out!
