Currently only one level can be played, but more enemies and levels will be added very soon.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Be aware that clicking away from the game will result in it losing focus - if the game is not responding to keypresses, then make sure you're using the right keys (U and A/D), and try clicking on the GREY BORDER at the edge of the viewport to regain focus\u00a0(not the actual game canvas). If all else fails, try reloading the page.</strong></em></p>\n<p>You can also download the exe or blit files below. The executable and blit files\u00a0may have lower latency between keypresses and response than the web version.</p>\n<p>The repository, with the code and the latest versions of all OS builds is at\u00a0https://github.com/ThePythonator/Super-Square-Bros/releases/latest.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (keyboard):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A/D - left/right</p>\n<p>U - jump</p>\n<p>Gamepad/controller is recommended, since the controls will correspond directly to the 32blit controls.</p>\n<p><em><strong>NOTE: </strong>Since this is made for 32blit, web and exe versions will have incorrect input prompts (for keyboard). E.g. 'Press A' actually means 'Press U':</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Up/left/down/right = W/A/S/D</em></p>\n<p><em>A/B/X/Y = U/I/O/P</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd46324a7ca60c9fef2708be55bda12d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Scorpion Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
