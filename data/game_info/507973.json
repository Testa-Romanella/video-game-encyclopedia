Other than you can set any number to width and height and drop your own image to make a puzzle</p>\n<p>I have made the project with godot engine in a week. There is a shader that decides whether to have a hole in the piece and each piece holds near pieces as variable in gdscipt therefore It can be generated randomly and be merged later. Approximately there are 100 lines for the shader and 400 lines for general functions such as grabbing, mixing, generating pieces, image importing(1:07\u00a0at the video\u00a0).</p>\n<p>I've never code this type of puzzle before in any engine , even I haven't even seen this kind of puzzle made in godot. If there was one, it would be helpful so I had to learn everything and to use my previous experience while making the project.</p>\n<p>I can't share the source code for now\u00a0because the project is freelance.</p><p><strong>USAGE VIDEO:</strong></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:43:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c8/0c8467377948807f6e9c09cd89bdbf2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["cenullum"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
