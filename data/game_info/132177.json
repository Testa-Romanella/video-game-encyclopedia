There isn't anything fancy in here just an endless car game and avoid-the-obstacles type game. I got the musics using Chiptone and a freesound asset. Good luck in the game(you might need it). Let me know your high scores! I'll add the HTML5 versions in a few hours.</p><p>Controls: Your mouse pointer will work as the controller.</p><p>NOTE 1: When using the non web builds, set Display Resolution to 800 x 600 as that's the default.</p><p>NOTE 2: For the web build, wait 30 seconds for the game to load.
