It's a game about rising up in a world that is falling. Players embark on a vertical journey to reach a large alien structure in the sky \u2013 the Mother Cube \u2013 by jumping up falling platforms so rapidly that they start to rise in the game world. They start out on the streets of a futuristic city and eventually reach a great height, with a neon-soaked vista unraveling before their eyes. Their ascension is backed by a pumping, retro-futuristic soundtrack that reacts dynamically to their progress and also changes the environment, bringing it to life.</p><p>This is a prototype. It contains the basic gameplay and one dynamic music track.</p><p>Team Members:</p><p>Vadim Nickel - Game Design, Music/Sound Design, Programming<br/></p><p>Philipp Baumann - 3D Art</p><p>Matan Gantz - 3D Art</p><p>Hans Reitemeyer - 2D Art</p><p>Tim Scheller - Programming<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67eb4235f6a30bb2372151b85b2e40f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["secretstage"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
