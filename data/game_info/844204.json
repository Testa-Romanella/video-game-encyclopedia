No prior knowledge of YAGS is necessary to enjoy the series, although it does contain spoilers for works in the YAGS series of games and writing.\r\n</p>\n<p>(If you're familiar with YAGS,\u00a0then ADTF is the story of Jake post-graduation, in the \"route\" where he and Nate broke up shortly before their 5-month anniversary.)\r\n</p>\n<p>ADTF was created for YaoiJam 2022 and is a collaboration with Deevilj, with sensitivity reading by TangledVirus.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: This is a Kinetic Novel.</strong>\u00a0That means that this game has no player choices, and instead is more like a book with art. It also features a few CGs and unlockable character profiles.</p>\n\n<p>ADTF is a Kinetic Novel and does not feature player choices.</p>\n<p>The game features:</p>\n<ul><li>54.7k words across 11 chapters</li><li>6 CGs, plus 8 viewable background renders</li><li>Unlockable character profiles</li></ul>\n<p>You can also obtain some ADTF stickers! (Or see the full set of available YAGS-verse swag.)</p>\n<p>ADTF features explicit language, discussions of sex and sexuality, discussions of romantic and sexual relationships between two men,\u00a0and censored visual male nudity.\u00a0As such, the game is not for minors.</p>\n<p>ADTF does not feature explicit sex or explicit nudity in its sprites or CGs.\u00a0Unlike other YAGS-verse games, the game cannot be uncensored.</p>\n\n<p>YAGS, or\u00a0Yearning: A Gay Story, is a traditional visual novel with dating sim elements following a (different) gay man's journey of coming out and navigating college life. Its sequel ZAGS, or\u00a0Zen: A Gay Sequel, is a stat-based dating sim also set in college.\r\n</p>\n<p>Playing YAGS or ZAGS is not necessary to enjoy ADTF, as the game\u00a0includes a prologue chapter summarizing all character and plot information necessary for the series. It also includes in-game unlockable character profiles that can serve as a further reminder as you read.\r\n</p>\n<p>However,\u00a0<strong>ADTF will heavily spoil major plot points in both games and the YAGS universe as a whole</strong>, so it is recommended that you enjoy the games first before consuming ADTF .\r\n</p>\n<p>If you're looking for games or visual novels with player choice, you will instead want to check out other works in the\u00a0YAGS universe.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T18:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/445/4451e1a5219c19a75a14615a35df1bb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["bobcgames", "Deevil"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
