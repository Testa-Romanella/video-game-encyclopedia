Complete with a highscore record keeping that is shown at the game over screen, and with a title screen as well - this is the first 'complete' game I've created on my own without asking for help for the Channel F. This means its quite the achievement for me!<br/><br/>You play as the human character catching fish, while a shark attempts to eat you. Getting a fish scores you a point, the shark moves faster as you gain more points.</p>\n<p>Use directional buttons to move the diver, avoid the shark while collection fish. Push button down at highscore screen to start a new game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T14:34:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/499/4997fe6019acf22182cbef044fdb130c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mikebloke"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
