This game is pretty much just me testing out voxel-esque stuff! Either press the picture or click here to download and check it out! Atm I've only tested it on Windows 7 so I can't guarantee it'll work on other platforms (9=0=)9! I may upload a web version later but for now we have a download !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/145f0d4c1bc94d1bb2bad87bfd6f8f70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaikonConsole"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
