They provide you all information needed to successfully complete a shift and produce high amount of energy.</p>\n<p>Reactor is modeled by real-life<strong> nuclear fission equation</strong>. Without your\u00a0adjustments\u00a0power output\u00a0will grow/decay exponentially.\u00a0Also it\u00a0has some inertia due to the presence of delayed neutrons. This means that the power output will try to\u00a0move in the same direction it was moving before even after you apply sharp control.\u00a0</p><p>The game consists of 5 levels and takes about <strong>3.5 minutes</strong> to complete.\u00a0You can press\u00a0<strong>Enter\u00a0</strong>to go home earlier. That ends current shift immediately,\u00a0\u00a0but your score will be lower.</p>\n<p>This is my first ever released game, made for GMTK 2020 game jam. Please have fun and post your feedback &amp;\u00a0high scores in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af0/af0b1c623b7e271e575e434475830ba5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dkorduban"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
