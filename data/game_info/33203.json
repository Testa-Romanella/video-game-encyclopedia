Tolkien&#39;s panoramic vision has been included in this epic game.</p>\n<p>Follow in the footsteps of Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf as they battle to get the ring to the Cracks of Doom. Ranged against you are all the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron and the corrupt wizard Saruman. The odds are overwhelming, but you cannot afford to fail. The destiny of Middle Earth lies in the balance.</p>\n<p>Multiple playing levels let you control all the characters and armies that appear in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; from the broad sweep of strategy, right down to individual characters&#39; actions on the battlefield. There are infinite possibilities so no two games will ever be the same. Gripping action means you will always want another game.</p>\n<p>Guard carefully and travel well, my friend. May the fellowship of the ring be successful, and peace returns to all Middle Earth.</p>\n<h3>FEATURES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Highly detailed maps that cover the whole of Middle Earth  </li>\n<li>Cinema quality animation  </li>\n<li>Stunning sound C64 (digitized on Amiga, Apple IIGS, and Atari ST versions)  </li>\n<li>Icon driven controls  </li>\n<li>Varying depth of play  </li>\n<li>Save and load game features  </li>\n<li>One player only</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-15T23:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ab/1ab2894c5d26d233301beb3bb4858f87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Synergistic Software"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Melbourne House"], "esrb_rating": null}
