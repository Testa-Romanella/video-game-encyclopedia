The goal was to make a simple, 2D top-down procedural dungeon crawler, and we were given small amounts of art and code in the form of a few basic shapes and really rudimentary functionality to achieve the assignment requirements.</p>\n<p>Over the course of 6+ weeks, I wrote my own code, made my own pixel art, and figured out how to use a simple beat sequencer. I exceeded the basic requirements of the project, because my aim was to make a cool game that would be fun in and of itself, and not just a bare-minimum project submission. Hence, Genesis Tower.</p>\n<p>Thanks and have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T15:49:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb2f91d29eee6c84efdfeb107d5ae25a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Blocker226"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
