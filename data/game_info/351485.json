In this hell of a battle you won't be able to solely rely on your weapons. You'll have to use your creativity and set up different traps to survive. <br/>No more bullets? Summon a giant dwarf from the Wizard's hat. Can't push through the walls of enemies? Fly away on a magic elevator. When you feel like there is no escape, pray and an army of crusaders will storm to you on a dope ass tram. <br/>Even if that won't better your situation, you can always choose to run away to the forest where you can chill with Gangsta bears!<h3> Features</h3><ul><li>the insane atmosphere filled with fun<br/></li><li>the rapid pace of the game that won't let you break away<br/></li><li>endless waves of funky enemies<br/></li><li>the main boss is a glamorous TREX<br/></li><li>HOT GIRLS</li></ul><br/>Last piece of advice: <strong>DON'T LET THE ALIENS CATCH YOU</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77a/77a11ca34c28ba1ad43b46ee5d972fdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NIPSAPP GAMING SOFTWARE PVT"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NIPSAPP GAMING SOFTWARE PVT"], "esrb_rating": null}
