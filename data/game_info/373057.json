And yes, your score can actually get to negative numbers!</p>\n\r\nThe floor is lava\r\n<p>You are fighting in a tiled floor map which changes its identity every moment. If you walk on RED floors you lose your hard earned score!</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the GREEN floors always welcome you with a good score boost.</p>\n\r\nWell, That's very Abnormal!\r\n<p>As you might find out at first, this retro style shooter has a very colorful and classic interface which is based on Cute Adblocker.\u00a0You can find\u00a0Backrooms enemies and Dasher's bosses voices and even the great and powerful Masher itself in 3D!\u00a0That's a fun mixture to\u00a0enjoy! And of course, it's Abnormal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T06:33:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57e/57e962da45be3ada74ff071bdae59430.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["IEP_Esy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
