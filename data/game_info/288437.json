In it, you also have to walk around the field 5 to 5, but when possible moves end and the minimum number of filled elements is reached, the player moves to the next field. The difficulty of the game increases with each field due to blocked cells.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/868/868b02ffba880773621511b7020f1bd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Airsoft Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
