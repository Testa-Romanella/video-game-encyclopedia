Depending on the situation, you must either run away from the red cells, or attack them and loose some of your own cells while doing so. The red cells will do the same, and sometimes even try to surround you and pin you to a corner.</p>\n<p>You must think of a good strategy and use powerups wisely to get the highest score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/872/8727509d124df98c22e7b26f15f0f9c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["TassuP"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
