You are waiting for skirmishes with ghosts, a lot of puzzles, a funny, but no less terrifying storyline, and much, much more. Try to look around more often, because no one knows where the trouble will be: maybe in an abandoned house, maybe on the street at night, or maybe... maybe even in your own house.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T12:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a17b0e7cc59d1faf43af1e6f82e75ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanHryGame7"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
