The goal of the game is simple: you (the blue soldier) must shoot the enemy (the red soldier) and survive long enough to be the last man standing.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is no ordinary combat, though - you control both the player and the enemy! The enemy will mirror your every move, including running, shooting, and everything in between.\r\n</p>\n<p>No action goes without repercussions from the enemy side, so the player will have to be thoughtful and quick with every move they take.\u00a0You'll have to learn to play both sides of the battlefield if you plan on emerging victorious!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T13:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a41/a416bc66ffdb0c7c6ed02d915d041810.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["It's_Dreamcastic"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
