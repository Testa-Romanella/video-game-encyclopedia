It is only from a found note, signed with his own name, that he learns that he himself has chosen to forget the past in order to get rid of the severe wounds of his soul.</p><p>In an attempt to understand what is happening, Daniel will have to explore the darkest corners of the castle and see the terrifying inhabitants of the place, each meeting with whom threatens him with imminent death.
