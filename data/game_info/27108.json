Nintendo might even send notes to you too! As your note \n      collection grows and you spend Play Coins, you\u2019ll unlock new features \n      and be able to personalize messages even further by changing stationery \n      patterns, attaching photos and sound recordings, writing and drawing in \n      3D, and more. You\u2019ll even be able to surprise your friends with secret \n      notes that they can only open on a certain date! Passing handwritten \n      notes to your friends is a breeze, regardless of whether they\u2019re sitting \n      across the room...or across the world!\n    </p><p>\n      Please note that the SpotPass feature of Swapnote (the ability to \n      send notes to friends over the Internet) has been stopped as of October \n      31, 2013. We greatly appreciate your understanding.
