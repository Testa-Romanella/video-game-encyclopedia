However it is time to start testing for improvements with a dedicated community like itch.io.</p>\n<p>The game is set on the Falkland Islands and is a simple multiplayer cap-the-point type of shooter. I plan to add a build menu for weapon emplacements and maybe even more sophisticated stuff but that lays in the future.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy what you see and would be happy to take feedback.</p>\n<p>Please also write in the discussion board if you encounter errors (the one when people disconnect are always there, just clear them when in the pause menu).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b748084d7a398961870aa488cbfc3b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sneek"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
