TO ENTER THE <strong>GENERICANIUM?</strong></em></p>\n<p>In GENERICANIUM, you enter the GENERICANIUM. As you progress through it, various foes will put forward their best to slow you down and end your dungeon-diving career. You must rely on your trusty gun (not shown) and big white sword to end theirs instead. Their being a monster career, that is; They aren't also trying to explore it. Either way, you want to get as far as possible and they don't want you to get far at all. Rack up points, and try to beat your personal best! Good Luck!</p>\n<p>GENERICANIUM is also my first game. Contact me on\u00a0twitter if you want to share highscores or talk about the game.
