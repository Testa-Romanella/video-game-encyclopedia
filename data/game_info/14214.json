Instead, they just pop up organically. That is the case here, Best Buds vs Bad Guys is a 2D run \u2019n\u2019 gun from a game developer Dad and his 11 year old son, with a special message behind it. Richard and Lucas both have a love of classic pixel art games, and always wanted to develop a game of this genre together.<br/><br/>\"We call each other 'best bud', and really wanted to create a game together. We both love classic pixel art games; exploring and discovering cool stuff, shooting lots of nasties! So from there the concept was born, a game about teamwork, battling bad guys and using stupidly powerful weapons and power-ups to do it. A game about good over evil and about friendship, overcoming difficulties, and kicking bad-guy butt!\"<br/><br/>\"We wanted to create an authentic retro experience which draws upon Lucas' imaginative ideas for enemies and levels and my admiration &amp; love of classic 80s/early 90s arcade machine games like Contra, Ghosts \u2019n Goblins, Green Beret, Mega Man, Bionic Commando and more.\"THE BAD GUYS<br/>We love themed enemies and themed levels; and this is on full display in Best Buds! Each enemy and boss has been lovingly crafted to have a distinct look, theme, and personality.<br/>And we love variety and diversity too - so that's why we pixelated over 100 of them, Nasty!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04c/04c88cf71d93a80a66289e090d9b4f33.jpg", "website": "http://www.supericon.co.uk/bestbuds/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 39}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Super Icon"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
