The villagers need your assistance and have sent you several requests for you to perform using your Spell-o-matic 2000 (no free form spell casting is permitted since the 'incident'). There's just one catch ... due to a mislabeled shipment of newt eyes your vision is quite limited. Do your best and try not to mess up the town too badly.</p>\n<p><strong>A Wizard's Life</strong>\u00a0is the ninth chapter in my <strong>One day at a time</strong>\u00a0series.\u00a0The series\u00a0was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order. <strong>A Wizard's Life</strong> is based on the 2016 Global Game Jam theme of \"Ritual\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:10:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a38/a3838080a6623332cb893f753ca2467f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
