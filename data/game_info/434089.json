{"id": 434089, "slug": "plum", "name": "Plum", "name_original": "Plum", "description": "<p>In this 2D puzzle platformer the player explores some ruins and finds a mysterious being in a tank. As you take the tank the floor collapses. You wake up deep in those ruins and find some mechanisms. To find your way out, you must solve puzzles but activating switches consumes the liquid in the tank you carry. Meaning you must find the most optimized way to solve those puzzles so the mysterious being doesn\u2019t run out of its vital liquid. If the mysterious being dies, the game is over.\u00a0 <br/></p><p><strong>Note: some mechanisms can be filled/emptied multiple times</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A game made during Ludum Dare 46 \u201cKeep it alive\u201d.
