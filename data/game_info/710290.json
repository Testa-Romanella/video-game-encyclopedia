I hope everyone enjoys. It is still in development. The final game will contain more than 12 dialogs. I enjoy working on this project as I get to write which Is something I have a love hate relationship with\u00a0(which you can see clearly while playing). Thank you for playing and giving me your time!</p>\n<p>Things I\u00a0want to work on:</p>\n<p>Polish:\u00a0Stupid things that should be in any game but I couldn't implement yet</p>\n<p>Modding: I want to be able to allow you to create your own characters and import them for your friend to play</p>\n<p>Dialogs: I would like their to be 12 dialogs, that are all of decent quality, for the final release of the game</p>\n<p>You can see my progress on those things here:\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/milllkkkyyy/Nothing</p>\n<p>All\u00a0 music is made by Autumn Keys (Creative Commons)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Artist Note [For my class]:</p>\n<p>I made this project because It was something fun and exciting on my end. I have never coded or have ever wanted to code a dating-sim but I decided to give it a try because why not? Then it got me thinking how can I connect this to the pandemic. I decided to design my game in such a way where you talked to someone pre-pandemic then after-pandemic and you can see how they changed. Then after getting my idea down I went straight to the computer.\u00a0I\u00a0started off coding the main flow of the game which was easy\u00a0because its just text and images. I then moved onto dialog which proved to be harder for me as I am not a writing expert or good at writing in any sense so that was rough. I created a system for dialogs that anyone could participate in and understand. They could write a character and draw for it and I can just import it into my game and play it.\u00a0I finished it off with art and music that fit the correct mood for the game I wanted to set. The game is quick. I want it to feel that way. I\u00a0made it quickly. I also wanted to make you feel like you really don't know why these people changed. Some of them you do because of poor writing, but I don't really want it to be that way. I game tested with a friend and he complained he felt there was no arc for the characters and that's kind of what I wanted. You meet these people. A year goes by that everyone felt isolated and they now have someone from before who for some reason hasn't changed. I can relate this to the topics we have done in class as I remember feeling quick whenever death was involved. When we read Pale Horse Pale Rider everything was quick after she got sick. In Hamlet [spoiler], we only get blimps from his mom on the way to his funeral. The rushed movies or shows to just go out and create something. I just wanted to create something. I think its sub-par but who cares what I think. I\u00a0hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T09:06:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c99/c99fd1dcf004df9aa56ef0cdd18a63a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MachiTeaStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
