Yeah, it sucks but no time to fix it \r\nHow to Play:\r\n<p>For every bullet you shoot, there's a <strong>50/50</strong> chance that an enemy will spawn in the nearest spawn point to you. The map starts with ~14 enemies. Enemies always <strong>die with 1 shot</strong>. Killing an enemy gives you <strong>2 health points</strong>, including deaths from rockets.<br/></p>\n<p>Oh yeah, rockets! Press <strong>Q\u00a0</strong>to shoot a rocket. You start with <strong>1 rockets</strong>. Rocket spawners give you<strong> 1 rocket every 30 seconds</strong>.<br/></p><p><em>PROTIP:</em> Everytime an enemy spawns, a metallic-like sound plays from the spawner it spawned in. The game's audio is binaural, so you can probably spot the general direction of the enemy from the sound.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to move,\u00a0<strong>Mouse</strong> to look,\u00a0<strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> to shoot and <strong>Spacebar</strong> to jump. <strong>Esc </strong>also immediately closes the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:19:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97e/97ef1c6c53e05948688c62ed922f8dd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["androidwg"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
