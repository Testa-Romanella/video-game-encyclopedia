{"id": 828149, "slug": "demon-ninja-runner", "name": "Demon Ninja Runner", "name_original": "Demon Ninja Runner", "description": "<p>The Demons Revenge\r\n</p>\n<p>A young 8-year-old boy in a black hooded robe and black shoes was looking at the ground, he walked through the forest as he heard the hatching of a crow and looked up at the sky to see the birds flying above the trees looking at everything around them. He stood near the large river which usually is full of fish, insects, and lots of other wildlife, but today it was unsettlingly empty. He climbed up with ease and sat on a large branch in an oak tree overlooking the water. He had dark skin with brown hair, his eyes a deep brown as he held something in his hand, it appeared to be a pendant held in a silver chain. As he looked at the river he slowly looked down at the pendant, it had a circular design with an odd symbol on it from a language he has never seen before.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The boy was standing on the branch looking at the river and then looked down at his pendant, he took it off his neck and held it in his hand. He looked up to see a large bird flying above him, as he watched it fly away from him into the distance. The boy smiled as he put the pendant back around his neck. He turned around to look out over the forest that surrounded him but saw nothing except for trees, no animals, or people anywhere near where he stood. He looked down at himself and noticed that there were two symbols on each side of his neck, one on each side of the collarbone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0He looked down at them and noticed that they were in a language he had never seen before. He was confused as to what this meant but knew that it must be important for him to have these symbols on his body. He turned around and walked back into the forest, leaving the river behind him. As he walked through the trees, he saw no people or animals anywhere near where he stood, he thought nothing of it and, continued walking until he came to a clearing in the forest. He stopped and looked around him, there was nothing but trees all around him.\r\n</p>\n<p>The boy walked into the clearing and saw that it was completely empty except for one large tree standing in the middle of it. As he got closer to this tree, he noticed that its bark had turned black over time and appeared as if it were made of metal or something like that. It stood about ten feet tall with two branches coming off each side, reaching up towards the sky at least twenty feet above his head from where he stood on the ground. The boy approached the tree and stood in front of it. He looked up at the branches and saw that they were covered with symbols, just like the ones on his body.\r\n</p>\n<p>The boy walked around to one side of the tree and noticed a large crack running down its trunk from top to bottom, but he did not pay much attention to this because he was more interested in what these symbols mean. The boy continued walking around this tree for about ten minutes before he finally came upon something interesting. There was a hole in one of the branches where it appeared as if someone had drilled through it, but no matter how hard he tried he could not see what lay beyond this hole. The boy returned home after having spent several hours searching for the answer to this mystery.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0When he got home, he knew something was off. The entire outside of his house was covered in the symbols he saw on the tree and his body. He took a few deep breathes and opened the door to his house. He stood there shocked with fear, he investigated the house and all he saw was a Never ending inky black void. He took a few steps back terrified of what was happening. He tried over a rock and fell. When he got up, he was basked in a red light. He turned around and saw a pair of giant red eyes looking at him like spotlights.</p>\n<p>\u00a0He slowly walked away from the eyes when suddenly a mouth appeared. It had rows upon rows of sharp jagged teeth and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared child.\u201d The boy could not help but stare at this thing in front of him, still scared he made sure to keep his distance. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The boy said, \u201cyour body.\u201d It spoke. the boy was terrified \"why?\" he said shakily \"Why do you want my body?!\" it snickered\u201d Because I need it.\" The boy knew he had to try and escape from this thing, so he ran into the house and locked the door behind him. He then turned around to see if the creature was following him and realized his house was gone. he was standing in the void.</p>\n<p>\u00a0it laughed \"you really thought you could hide from me\" \"let me go\" he said \"it's too late now\" it said with a devilish smile \"I don't understand\" he said \"good\" it replied \"if you don\u2019t let me go you're going to regret it\"\u00a0 he said he was trying to act as tough as he could knowing full well he didn't have any plan on how he would force it let him go let alone what he would do when he got away \"acting tough are we,\" \"I was going to toy with you for a little but I think I will merge with you know\" it said suddenly there was a bright flash of light and the boy felt like his entire body was on fire.</p>\n<p>the demon flew into his chest. the symbols on the boy\u2019s neck grew and covered his entire body and started glowing a very bright florescent white light. the boy could barely stand up on his own. then he heard the demon start screeching \"NOOOOOOOOOO!\" \"What have you done to me\" it said the boy looked at his body realized the symbols on his body started Spinning around his body at impossible speeds. for moment there was silence the boy opened his eyes to look around but was immediately struck with indescribable nausea. everything felt like it was spiraling but no matter how hard he tried he could not close his eyes. suddenly there was an ear-piercing high-pitched sound. His head started pounding in unspeakable pain as he was brought to his knees he started screaming and wailing in pain saliva foaming out of his mouth, eyes strained from the tears he shed in agony, and cheeks stinging from his tears before passing out. He awoke few hours later from the sounds of crickets and owls hooting. He was in the middle of the moonlit forest. he stood up looked up at the sky and realized it was the middle of the night. he thought he must have fallen asleep while he was in the forest and a horrible nightmare. assuming he was fine he started walking home his body sore and tired all over and although unaware of this the demon had been sealed inside of him fuming with rage.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>7 Years later...\r\n</p>\n<p>Its early afternoon and Misaki just finished school he walked out of the ninja academy a little worried about the final exam tomorrow, because this decides whether, he well become a Genin a real ninja! A Genin is low level ninja who can start doing Missions for their village that the village gets paid for. Misaki started walking home thinking about what the exam might be. Transformation Jutsu, or could it be clone Jutsu either way he had to pass so he could become a Genin so he can train to become a Chunin. He was how before he knew it. The first thing he did was start training. He started with his kunai and shuriken accuracy and after that trained to perfect his Transformation and Clone Jutsu\u2019s. After a long day of training Misaki ate dinner. After that he went to bed nervous about the big exam but brushed it out of his mind and fell asleep. In the morning he rushed to school eager but equally nervous for the exam. He got to the academy and started school the day flew and before he knew it was time for the Genin Exams. Misaki waited for what felt like forever for his turn and when it finally arrived, he was more than ready to pass. This year to pass the exam one had too successfully use Clone Jutsu. Misaki walked up to the front of the class closed his eyes and focused. Then preformed the Jutsu perfectly creating two clones of himself, one on his left and one on his right. His teacher was impressed and Misaki passed the exam. The teacher handed him a hidden leaf village headband and Misaki returned to his seat. Misaki couldn\u2019t wait to go home and brag about how he had finally become a Genin.</p>\n<p>When Misaki got home he saw his dad standing outside the front door. He asked his dad what he was doing, and he said, \u201cpack your bags we leave first thing in the morning.\u201d Misaki looked confused but smiled and said \u201cok\u201d as he walked inside his house to started bragging about being a Genin. The night passed and early in the morning he woke up to knocking on his door. He checked the time, it was 3:45 in the morning, he opened the door to find his dad asking him \u201care you ready?\u201d Misaki replied \u201cyes.\u201d Misaki grabbed his bags followed his dad out if the house. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Misaki asked. \u201cWe are going to start your training to become a Chunin\u201d his father replied. They walked for Twenty-five miles until they came upon and old samurai training dojo. \u201cThis is where you will be training Misaki are you ready?\u201d \u201cWho is going to train me? and who is my sensei?\u201d Misaki replied \u201cI will be your sensei and, I will teach you the way of the secret Leaf Village samurai.\u201d said his father enthusiastically. Misaki\u2019s face lit up with glee. \u201cWhen do I start?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou start right now\u201d said his father as he opened the door to the dojo. Inside there was everything you could possibly imagine inside of a samurai training dojo. There were dummies, swords, staffs, kunai, shuriken's, a battle hall, and anything else you can think of. Misaki was mesmerized by all the different weapons and training equipment, he thought it was going to be all fun and games, but he had no idea what hell was waiting for him here.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are six months before the Chunin Exams and Misaki must learn fast, so training is going to be brutal. During the first month they focused on chakra control. The first exercise he did is called the Tree Climbing practice. The Tree Climbing Practice is a training method used to gain more skills with chakra control. This training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra to the bottom of one's feet and using that to climb a tree without using one's hands. If the stream of chakra is too weak, the user will lose their footing on the tree and fall off. If it is too strong, the user will be pushed away from the tree, causing the tree to break around the point of contact and the user will fall. The first day Misaki tried this he thought it would be easy. He backed ran as fast as he could up the tree but fell off and hit his head immediately. He kept trying and by the end of the week he had mastered it. His father was very impressed, and they moved on to the next exercise. Next is the Water Surface Walking Practice. This training method is used to gain better chakra control. To do this, the user must be emitting a constant stream of chakra from the bottom of their feet and using the repellent force to walk across the water's surface. This technique is more difficult to master than the Tree Climbing Practice, because the amount of chakra that needs to be emitted changes constantly. This technique allows its users to walk on sticky surfaces without being affected. It doesn't have to just be at the feet. A user under water can focus chakra on their hands or any other body part that makes contact with the water's surface. If they were submerged, they can climb atop the water as if they were climbing out of a pool. Misaki knew this one was going to be much more difficult he was going to give it his all no matter what. He stood near a creek about a mile away the dojo and consecrated. He spent a whole week trying to master this exercise, but something was off with his chakra. He couldn\u2019t control it the way he could before.</p>\n<p>Misaki started breathing heavily he put his face in his palms closed his eyes. When he removed his hands and opened his eyes, he froze with fear. \u201cit's been a long-time child...\u201d it said as Misaki fled in fear before realizing he was in the inky black nothingness of the void. He turned around to face it when he remembered something he\u2019s a Genin now he thought to himself maybe I can scare it away. He mustered up all his courage and said, \u201cI\u2019m not the same little kid I was the last time, I\u2019m a Genin now I am not afraid of you anymore\u201d it howled with devilish laughter \u201cHAHAHAHA\u2026 you really think I am here to harm you?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWell fortunately for you I just want to talk\u201d it said with a devilish grin. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Misaki said. \u201cI want you to let me go.\u201d It spoke. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Misaki \u201cThese past seven years I have been stuck inside of your body unable to do anything, and now that you are a Genin mastering your chakra control you woke me, and this dreaded seal mark has appeared on your body.\u201d Misaki looked at his body saw the symbols pulsing in a bright florescent white light. Confused Misaki said \u201cHow are you stuck inside me?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhen I flew into your body to become one with your soul, those symbols on your body turned into a sealing Jutsu so strong I couldn\u2019t escape.\u201d ARRRGGGHHH\u2026 it started coughing \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d said Misaki, but before it could answer Misaki awoke standing in the creek he was training in his father walked up and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Misaki his father replied, \u201cyou stood there lifeless for thirty minutes what happened?\u201d \u201cIt was nothing\u201d said Misaki afraid of telling his father what really happened. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me \u2013 \u201c\u201cIt was NOTHING\u201d said Misaki cutting off his fine father. \u201cFine but we are coming back to this creek first thing tomorrow morning understood?\u201d \u201cYes father.\u201d Said Misaki they returned to the dojo and true to his word they were out at the creek first thing in the morning. Misaki spent all day practicing the water walking exercise but was still unable to do it \u201cWhy are you having such a tough time with this?\u201d His father said impatiently \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Said Misaki \u201cI can\u2019t control my chakra the way I could before.\u201d His father was quiet for moment then asked, \u201cwhat happened yesterday?\u201d Reluctantly Misaki said \u201cI had a vison or something I saw this creature and it started talking how it got sealed inside of me seven years ago, but I don\u2019t what it\u2019s talking about.\u201d What happened in the forest Misaki?\u201d said his father \u201cWhat are talking about?\u201d said Misaki. His father replied, \u201cremember seven years ago when you told your mother and I that you fell asleep in the forest?\u201d \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d Suddenly Misaki had horrible flashback to all the pain he felt after \u201cit\u201d flew into him. He fell to his knees out of breath his father ran over. \u201cAre you ok Misaki?\u201d his father asked as he helped him back up \u201cyeah I\u2019m ok\u201d said Misaki \u201cok now tell me everything think that happened that night Misaki I need to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\u201cI started walking home but I noticed something I was off I didn\u2019t hear any birds chirping, water running or insects making noises.\u201d \u201cThat is odd.\u201d Said his father \u201ccontinue\u201d \u201cI continued walking and by the time I got home I was surrounded by nothing but the never-ending inky blackness of the void.\u201d \u201cThe creature was there too.\u201d \u201cIts eyes were like spotlights always looking at me never afraid.\u201d \u201cIt started talking about how it was looking for me.\u201d \u201cIt wanted me.\u201d \u201cI was the only one that he could do something with.\u201d \u201cI acted tough.\u201d \u201cI thought could scare it away.\u201d \u201cThen it said something about merging with me now.\u201d \u201cIt flew into my chest and then there was a bright flash of light.\u201d \u201cSuddenly my body felt like it was on fire and these symbols covered my entire body and started spinning around my body.\u201d \u201cI was brought to my knees stricken with a migraine and indescribable nausea.\u201d I was crying my eyes puffy and cheeks stinging.\u201d I couldn\u2019t control myself.\u201d \u201cFoam Started leaking from my mouth I was screaming and wailing pain and the\u2026\u201d \u201cI passed out.\u201d \u201cI woke up in the middle of the forest\u00a0my body sore and covered with bruises I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d \u201cI thought it was a dream, so I didn\u2019t tell you or mom and NOW\u2026\u201d \u201cNow it is interfering with my training.\u201d Misaki?\u201d said his father \u201cyes dad?\u201d \u201cI am going to have to do something very painful to you are you ready?\u201d Misaki looked at his father and nodded his head. \u201cOk take your shirt off,\u201d said his father. Misaki did as his was asked revealing his bare chest. after doing several hand signs Misaki\u2019s father started gathering chakra in the tips of fingers then he violently jabbed Misaki in the stomach sending him to his knees immediately. Misaki started coughing and gasping for air. Coughing Misaki said, \u201cwhy did you Cough! Do that Cough, Cough...\u201d \u201cTry the Water Surface Walking Practice again,\u201d said his father. Misaki stood up concentrated, closed his eyes, and attempted the exercise. Expecting to be in the water he opened his eyes and found himself walking on the surface of the creek. \u201cI\u2019m Doing it\u201d he said. \u201cGood job\u201d said Misaki\u2019s father \u201cnow we move not to the next part of your training.\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked Misaki his father snickered \u201cI am going to teach you how to use Iron sand.\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>Iron Sand is something the Third Kazekage created After studying the sand manipulation abilities of Shukaku's jinch\u016briki, the Third Kazekage was able to imitate this ability using iron powder instead of sand, and his special magnetic powers. He often molded the iron powder into weapons and used them as part of his main fighting style. When used in sufficient quantities, this iron sand can be equipped in various ways in order to create useful techniques ranging from large structures to bullet-like particles and multiple striking branches. The first to techniques you will learn are The Iron Sand Gathering Assault, and The Iron Sand Drizzle Attack.\u201d \u201cThe first one you will learn is The Iron Sand Gathering Assault,\u201d said his father. Iron Sand Gathering Assault is a technique which gathers a great volume of Iron Sand and compresses it into a high-density shape. This technique greatly increases the hardness of the Iron Sand, creating a gigantic steel-like weapon in an instant. The weight and size of these shapes are so great, they can easily shatter bedrock and break through most defenses with a single hit because the weapon is made of Iron Sand, the shape can be whatever the user wants, and can even be changed during the fight. This allows the user to create the best weapon for the fight, by considering the opponent's abilities and the surrounding environment. Since the Iron Sand generates a strong magnetic field, the opponent cannot use any metal weapons or tools. \u201cAre you ready to dedicate all your time and energy into this Misaki?\u201d asked his father \u201cYes sir\u201d said Misaki. Ok said Misaki\u2019s father your training starts now!\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cFirst\u201d started Misaki\u2019s father \u201cyou must learn how to combine the demon\u2019s chakra with your own.\u201d \u201cDoing this will triple the strength of your chakra and increase the amount of chakra tenfold!\u201d \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d Said Misaki \u201cFirst you have to let some of the demon\u2019s chakra freely flow through you, then introduce it to some of your own chakra, and combine them to create a very powerful black chakra.\u201d \u201cThat is the chakra you will wield the Iron Sand with.\u201d \u201cDo you understand?\u201d asked Misaki\u2019s father. \u201cYeah, I think I understand.\u201d Misaki replied. Misaki took a few steps away from his father put his hands together, closed his eyes, and concentrated. After a minute he started to feel light like he was faster, and he felt stronger. His father looked over at him and saw that his arm started turning dark grey and jagged. \u201cSTOP!\u201d his father yelled\r\n</p>\n<p>Startled Misaki took a deep breathe stopped and put his hands down. \u201cTry doing a Jutsu this time\u201d said his father \u201cok\u201d answered Misaki. He put his hands together, closed his eyes, and concentrated. He felt that same surge power again and then proceeded to do the Fire Style Fireball Jutsu. The Fireball Jutsu is when the user kneads chakra in their body and turns it into fire, which they then expel from their mouth; the more chakra they use, the more flames that are produced. Sometimes the flames lack a distinct shape, being only a stream, but more often than not they take the form of a giant orb that maintains its shape until hitting a target. Upon impact, the fireball is powerful enough to crater the ground and vaporize the surroundings. Against living targets, the fireball can cause extensive burns. When he let out the fireball instead of being a red orange Flame it was a furious black flame incinerating everything in its path. This time when his father was watching Misaki he noticed that his entire arm was coated in a jet-black material with sharp jagged points. \u201cYou can stop now,\u201d said his father. Misaki stopped and his arm went back to normal. \u201cThis time I want you try doing the Shadow clone Technique.\u201d Said Misaki\u2019s father. \u201cOk\u201d Replied Misaki. The Shadow Clone Technique is a clone technique created by Tobirama Senju. This jutsu allows the user to create one or more copies of themselves. The user's chakra is evenly divided between themselves and their clones: creating one clone will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will give each a third of the user's chakra, and so on. Depending on how much chakra the user has and how many clones they make, this rapid depletion of their reserves can be dangerous. Because of this, usually only those of at least jonin-level can safely use the standard Shadow Clone Technique. The Multiple Shadow Clone Technique \u2013 which creates hundreds of clones to the standard version's dozens \u2013 is unsafe to the point of being forbidden. He put his hands together, closed his eyes, and concentrated. Misaki went to perform the Shadow clone technique, but instead did a transformation which covered his entire body with jet black sharp jagged material and covered his face with a red Japanese Ono mask. The Transformation Technique allows the user to take the appearance of whatever they choose. This technique is most often used to disguise the user as another person, but they can also turn into an animal, plant, or inanimate object; according to Sasuke Retsuden, inanimate objects are the most difficult to transform into, and users are shown familiarizing themselves with an object's weight and feel before assuming its form. Users will gain the attributes and physical features of whatever they transform into, such as a weapon's sharpness or an animal's fangs. To be able to assume so many different forms make this technique invaluable for not just combat, but intelligence gathering and diversionary tactics as well. \u201cMisaki?\u201d asked his father. \u201cThere is no Misaki there is only Xenarc!\u201d It said with a deep demonic tone. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d said Misaki\u2019s father \u201cI banished you twenty-seven years ago! Xenarc looked at Misaki\u2019s father \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time\u2026 old friend\u201d it said with a demonic snicker. Misaki\u2019s father took a step back when suddenly Xenarc shoulder charged him knocking Misaki\u2019s father to the ground. Then Xenarc started forming a ball of chakra in his hand which Misaki\u2019s father recognized as Raesengan. The Rasengan is a spinning ball of chakra formed and held in the palm of the user's hand, which is only known to a handful of shinobi. On contact, the Rasengan grinds into its target, propels them along the Rasengan's trajectory - either away from the user or into the ground beneath them - and at some point, bursts, causing severe damage at the point of contact. Misaki\u2019s father stood up but before he could react Xenarc nailed him with Rasengan sending him crashing into a tree. \u201cyou\u2019ve gotten weaker old man\u201d said Xenarc snickering, Misaki\u2019s father coughed \u201cwhy have you done this to my son?\u201d asked Misaki\u2019s father, \u201cBecause you sealed me inside him!\u201d Xenarc hissed. \u201cYOU MONSTER!\u201d Misaki\u2019s father said as he shot a fireball at Xenarc. Xenarc quickly formed an iron sand wall in front of him blocking the fireball, then using the Iron Sand Drizzle Attack Xenarc shot multiple small sharp projectiles at Misaki\u2019s father. The Iron Sand Drizzle Attack is a gunshot-like attack which uses Iron Sand hardened into minuscule grains to attack simultaneously across a vast range. The bullets are so fast that they are difficult to see. The moment the user has finished preparing the attack, evading it becomes extremely difficult. Using the repellent force of magnetism, the speed of the bullets is rapidly increased after they are shot. Furthermore, the user can also use an attack pattern where the Iron Sand bullets are shaped into sharp needles, increasing their ability to wound or kill the opponent.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0using the substitution jutsu Misaki's father replaced himself with a log to appear behind xenarc nailing him with the Rasengan smashing him into a tree. The Substitution Jutsu is when the instant before they are to be struck by an attack, the user replaces themselves with a block of wood or something similar. Because the attack does hit something, opponents may briefly believe that they've successfully struck the user. But this is merely an optical illusion and opponents will quickly notice what's happened. If users are fast enough, they can use this brief lapse in the opponent's attentions to stage a counterattack Xenarc got back on his feet quickly. Then using the Iron Sand Coffin Attack Xenarc captures and encases Misaki\u2019s father in a pile of hardened iron sand making it impossible for Misaki\u2019s father to escape. The Iron Sand Coffin Attack is when he uses the iron sand to immobilize his targets and capture them. Because the sand is naturally malleable, most of the target's usual methods for defense or escape become ineffective once they've been encased by it. They can only wait until he releases or kills them. Misaki\u2019s father starts charging himself with lighting letting it flow through his entire body. Xenarc starts pacing around Misaki\u2019s father and snickers \u201clook at you The Great Kahnji Onitatsu Master of The Samurai art and the Iron Sand Technique, caught like a fly in web whose life is now rests in the palm of my hand.\u201d \u201cI beat you once and I can do it again!\u201d Misaki\u2019s father yelled as he discharged all the lighting into his iron sand coffin reducing it to dust. \u201cImpressive\u201d said Xenarc \u201cNow let\u2019s test your Taijutsu\u201d said Xenarc. Taijutsu is a basic form of techniques and refers to any techniques involving the martial arts or the optimization of natural human abilities. Taijutsu is executed by directly accessing the user's physical and mental energies, relying on the stamina and strength gained through training. It typically does not require chakra, though chakra may be used to enhance its techniques. Taijutsu generally requires no hand seals to perform, occasionally making use of certain stances or poses, and are far quicker to use than ninjutsu or genjutsu. Taijutsu is, simply put, hand-to-hand combat. Now in the middle of hand-to-hand combat Xenarc says \u201cToo slow\u201d as he dodges, blocks, and counters Kahnji\u2019s attacks, hitting him back every chance he gets. \u201cI\u2019ll show you too sl-\u201d before Kahnji could finish talk he was smashed by an uppercut sending him to the ground.\r\n</p>\n<p>Kahnji threw two kunai knives at Xenarc but instead of impaling him they just bounced off his body. Then Kahnji realized what had covered Misaki\u2019s body. it was it was hardened Iron Sand acting like an impenetrable set of armor, and Kahnji knew there was only one thing he could use to cut through it Chidori One Thousand Birds. The Chidori is a high concentration of lightning chakra channeled around the user's hand. To perform, the user first gathers lightning to their hand; the high concentration of electricity produces a sound reminiscent of many birds chirping, hence the name. The lightning chakra has been shown on occasions to damage the user's hand, peeling the skin and causing it to smolder slightly, but this does not appear to be debilitating. Once the chakra is gathered, users charge at their target and thrust the Chidori into them, piercing them and typically causing fatal damage. Despite the sound it makes, the rapid speed at which it's used makes it useful for assassinations. Kahnji stood up and tossed two smoke bombs to cover his tracks and appeared behind Xenarc sprinting at him using the Rasengan. Kahnji went to shove the Rasengan into Xenarc when suddenly he created a. large, jagged Iron Sand Wing using the Black Iron Wings technique to block the attack sending Kahnji back a few feet. The Black Iron Wings Technique is when the user creates wings out of Iron Sand that can be used for flight. Using these wings, the user can also generate feathers in the form of homing missiles, as well as combine the wings to form a giant spear. Then Xenarc shot his feathers at Kahnji who used the Substitution Jutsu to appear behind Xenarc and strike him the Chidori. Instead of stabbing Xenarc, Kahnji jabbed him in the back discharging all of the lighting through Xenarc\u2019s body tossing him into a tree knocking him out cold and turning him back into Misaki. Kahnji snickered even with his Rinnegan. The Rinnegan is reputed as the most exalted eye amongst the \"Three Great Dojutsu\", the others being the Sharingan and the Byakugan. he Rinnegan is able to see chakra and its flow within the body, as well as otherwise invisible barriers, but cannot see through obstructions such as smoke bombs. Possession of the Rinnegan allows one to easily master any jutsu as well as all five basic nature transformations. Misaki looked up at his father and asked, \u201cwhat happened?\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T16:27:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e3328dd383199792b045d5c0552c2c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["xXAmenRaXx"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
