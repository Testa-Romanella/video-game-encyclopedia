However, you must avoid them as you dodge the space wall and dash through rocks. Try to beat my high score of 35. Once you get to 50, the difficulty stops increasing so if you want to have a harder goal, try getting to 50.\u00a0 We only had like 1 Day to make this so the game's kinda sucks. Also there's a\u00a0 bug where it won't proceed to the losing screen.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Takago - Programmer, (Sort of) Vector Artist,\u00a0SFX Artist</p>\n<p>Miyaki - Other Artist</p>\n<p>Wolfgang - Chase!
