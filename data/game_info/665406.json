It's a top down 2D Rogue-lite created in the Unity Engine. You play as a lumberjack who leaves the safety of the walls of the city to cut down trees in the forest. This game is serving as a prototype for a game that I want to make in the future, so please leave me a comment to let me know what you think! Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b865e5ac71d6a61d9247dba454f2432e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jhcrafton"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
