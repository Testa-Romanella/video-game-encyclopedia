Some personal things I know I'd like to improve are the main menu, icons for the weapon power-ups, and I tried really hard but was unable to implement a reliable four player experience.</p>\n<p>Overall, this was a fun project, and I look forward to improving from here.

Your feedback will help to make my future projects that much better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T09:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be6/be665f6bbe75e2359170693cee049813.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Skyler Riggle"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
