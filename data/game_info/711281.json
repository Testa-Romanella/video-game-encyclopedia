I'm glad I participated in this game jam and learned a lot, for example the use of splines, I created and animated my first model in blender (the dancing robot &lt;3) and generally I was aiming towards a more detailed and realistic approach in regards to the 19th century and more cinematic effects. I tried to combine the letter I received with my own interests, artistic vision\u00a0and aesthetics. It was quite hard to research some composers from this time period who aren't cis male and someone performed their compositions\u00a0to use for free, but I included at least Maria Theresia von Paradis and\u00a0</strong><strong><strong>Tekla B\u0105darzewska-Baranowska. Initially I wanted to include biological drawings of aliens to be projected and wanted to project real video files (a problem I was also confronted with in my recent performative reading video for SEHR ERNSTE Wien, overlapping with this game's time of production) - I kinda faked with the images, so that's something I would love to see in my future\u00a0projects, for heading towards my plans for an authentic\u00a0digital theatre experience. I hope I can develop more of my main and more iterated projects without a time limit during the next year(s). Right now I'm very excited for the future regarding my upcoming games.</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>I wish you a pleasant end of the year.</strong></p>\n<p>~ luka, 19th December 2021</p>\n\n<p><em>\"WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT\"</em> - Samuel F.
