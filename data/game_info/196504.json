Thought it could be quite flexible to integrate into different games so I kept it separate from the rest of my actual game. However their is some work that still needs to be done for it to be labelled as complete.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c6570ef611eef178fc84a1a58ca65a46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JLinards"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
