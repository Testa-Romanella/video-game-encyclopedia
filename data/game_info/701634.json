My first finished game!<br/></p>\n<p>Control the cursor to avoid bullets. Like, most of them. Some of them are friendly tho.<br/>Version 1.0 with 5 difficulties and 5 bullet types! Any disabled buttons are for future updates. Yeah, ????? is currently inaccessible too.</p>\n<p>While this game is technically playable on mobile, I don't recommend it; mostly because you can cheat by tapping places to teleport the cursor, but things like bullet spawning can also get a bit weird for some reason.</p>\n<p>And yeah, there's a pause menu. Press ESC.</p>\n<p>Don't try quitting on the web version, it just freezes lol.</p>\n<p>Recreation of one of my old Scratch projects which you can play\u00a0right here.</p>\n<p>So, have fun I guess.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Your browser might say this file is dangerous; it isn't, choose the option to keep it.</em></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Made with Godot Game Engine.
