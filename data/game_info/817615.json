{"id": 817615, "slug": "balloon-battle-meter-games", "name": "Balloon Battle (Meter Games)", "name_original": "Balloon Battle (Meter Games)", "description": "<p>My first original game. While it does make use of a few commercial-use fonts, sounds,\u00a0my friend's art,\u00a0and a very nice background, the majority of this game is original and done without the help of tutorials or guides. Currently in beta, I\u00a0hope to add several features before a full release across PC and Mac. While in the current state, the game is only available for PC.</p>\n<p>Balloon Battle is a\u00a0combination of Flappy Bird and Galaga, featuring shoot-em-up inspired combat combined with the frustration of maintaining altitude through increasingly imposing terrain.</p>\n<p>As you pilot your hot air balloon through a cave, you'll face many different enemies. Blimps, Helicopters, and Planes will shower you with a hail of bullets and missiles as the ceiling and floor close in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily, you're not without a fighting chance! Collect health and ammunition as it flies past you in order to defeat the onslaught of enemies. Weapon upgrades will allow you to simultaneously fire multiple bullets and missiles at your opponents, while extra lives will grant you a second chance to fight without sending you back to the start.</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY:\r\n<p>- Avoid Bullets and Missiles!</p>\n<p>- Shoot Enemies and Bosses!</p>\n<p>- Collect Ammo, Health, Weapon Upgrades, and Extra Lives!</p>\n<p>- Set the Highest Score!</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<p>-\u00a0Hold Space\u00a0Bar to Fly</p>\n<p>- Release Space Bar to Fall</p>\n<p>- Left Click Mouse to Shoot Bullets</p>\n<p>- Right Click Mouse to Fire Missiles</p>\n<p>- Left Shift: Pause / Un-pause</p>\n<p>- Esc: Quit</p>\r\nCREDITS:\r\n<p>- \"Pixel Fantasy Caves\" (Background) - Szadi Art</p>\n<p>- \"Eat My Shorts\" (Font) - Quinn Davis Type</p>\n<p>- \"Cute Aurora\" (Font) - 611 Studio</p>\n\n<p>- \"Unity Particle Pack\" (Explosions) - Unity Technologies\u00a0</p>\n<p>- \"Advanced Game Sounds\" (Audio) - Epic Stock Media\u00a0</p>\n<p>- \"MMO Game Magic\" (Audio) - Epic Stock Media</p>\n\n<p>- Title Artwork - Omer Gungoren\u00a0</p>\n<p>- All other art, mechanics, and attributes - Michael A.
