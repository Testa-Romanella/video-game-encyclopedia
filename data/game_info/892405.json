{"id": 892405, "slug": "tumultuous-tiles", "name": "Tumultuous Tiles", "name_original": "Tumultuous Tiles", "description": "<p>Simple sudoku like tile game based on an old Survivor challenge. Arrange tiles on the board so that no single row, column (or diagonal if playing on hard) has any repeating colors or symbols. Press \"CHECK\" to see if your solution is correct. For a first timer anything under 5 minutes is good. Once you know how to solve it you can knock it out in about a minute.</p>\n<p>Made in Godot 3.5 over about a month and a half. Best played with a mouse, but a touchscreen works well too. It is not really optimized on mobile, but it is playable.
