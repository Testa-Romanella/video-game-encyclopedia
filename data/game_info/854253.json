{"id": 854253, "slug": "project-animal", "name": "Project Animal", "name_original": "Project Animal", "description": "<p>The game was developed to give children in the Netherlands a tool to learn about animals in national parks. The idea is that you, a smart personality, are helping a professor with his machine that turns you into an animal. Unfortunately, the machine breaks during testing and the parts are spread in the national park. Your task is to explore the park, learn about the animals and find the part of the machine.</p>\n<p>This is a project from the first year of my studies as Game Designer. We worked in a group of five during the most of the time. Two weeks before the hand in, two other people joined the group. Sadly, some of our bug fixes got lost when we had to deliver the game because someone made a push mistake in GitHub and because of new projects I had no time to make chances again. This is just a prototype and definitely not close to the finish line. If I find time I will make changes to the game and fix some bugs and issues.</p>\n<p>I would appreciate a comment and some critical feedback. I know that a lot is missing and not working as intended. If you want more information on the game and idea send me a message.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T17:06:02", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
