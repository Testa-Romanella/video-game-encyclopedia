My favorite part I can say, again and again, Mr. Alfred is a fat annoying dude, trust me I hate to be a hater, fat people are cute, hot, and even smart also get the chicks but this dude nope even if he was muscular or the rock, with his brain and personality he would still remain the most annoying guy in the world. What's the reason for him waiting for Mrs vet? well, it's not obvious but for me, it is, Mr. Alfred here has been turned down by Mrs.vet 82 times now and counting am sure this would be making it 83rd time now, Mrs vet sighs and approaches him,-me</p>\n<p>Mrs vet-\u201cok let's get to the point Mr. Alfred, am not going to give m\u2026\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>MR.Alfred-(smirking with his missing teeth from his last punch from Mrs vet when he tried to group her) \u201csave it\u00a0 vet and come with me to the principal office, your day has finally come\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>ok I wasn\u2019t expecting that maybe this might not be the 83rd time maybe the next day might,\u2026Mrs vet walks a few meters behind Mr. Alfred as they walked to the principal office, his dress today was quite outstanding than previous days, like the day he was putting on a see-through shirt(god that was onion to the eyes of many),\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Mrs vet-\u201chmm you looking good today, what's the catch\u201d her way of complimenting him\r\n</p>\n<p>Mr.Alfred-\u201cnothing just I got what I wanted and a date tonight\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>ok, hold on there, getting what he wants, which is of course putting Mr vet in trouble and sending her off this job as she failed to give him her packages, and hold on a date?
