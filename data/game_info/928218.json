This game was developed by a group of 4 people using Unity out of our own interest. In <em>The AI Story</em>, the player will be controlling a programmer who has developed their own artificial intelligence (AI) at their job. The game will simulate the passing of time by giving the player the opportunity to talk with their AI on a schedule similar to a work week. Each typical day will involve the programmer talking with their AI, before playing a mini-game under the AI\u2019s witness. Within each passing day, the AI will behave differently, giving the programmer more encouragement until it goes totally crazy. Once the player notices the negative trajectory of the AI, they will gather information about the AI through a design document or a Twitter account, which will help them decide whether to save the AI or destroy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T21:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a179e50acb7426a1749b3f0242a214ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mattpalermo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
