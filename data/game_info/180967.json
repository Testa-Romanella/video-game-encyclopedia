After pressing the button don't forget to click on each modified axis and press enter so it gets applied.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br/>Slider is broken in this version of engine (UE-44960 please fix this already :( ), so please use keyboard number keys for entering values instead of sliding with mouse (we made a workaround which is why slider is so janky but kind of works). <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c49007c5bb2065d374ea9f9831f14dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
