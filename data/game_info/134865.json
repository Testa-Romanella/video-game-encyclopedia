Population increase leads to an increased demand for reliable infrastructure, nowadays combined with a need for increased energy efficiency and a higher environmental awareness of the public. These are the kind of issues or question that I was trying to raise in the game development cycle, but couldn't go through with it due to time being a big key factor if I wanted to tackle this issue correctly. I chose instead to focus mainly on my experience during my Derive, where I found myself feeling fascinated on the two areas that I visited which where Chinatown and little Italy. The two areas are drastically different from each other and I thought this would be a good idea to showcase the differences in an abstract way within the project. The first part of the project I started by building a small little street block that has a bunch of little stores and street traffic which represents Canal Street in Chinatown and I began incorporating the mood or experience that I felt with the crowd during my time there. In the second part of project I created an artistic environment that is cover with art and luxurious mood that showcase how I saw little Italy during my visit. In both environment I focus on making the player feel the situation that I felt personality while also showing lack of space by using objects that grow from small to big or using object that represent the crowd that I follow to get a glimpse of the culture in the areas I visited.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da0/da0e843e493e69dfee2d82ff34b953b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jose Deschamps"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
