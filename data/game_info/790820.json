The Superhero Luchador TTRPG", "description": "<p>SuperLucha combines two of my favourite lesser seen settings for a Tabletop Role Playing Game \u2013 Superheroes and Wrestling \u2013 into one action packed and easy to pick up game using the Wushu System (originally developed by Daniel Bayn). Its goal is to simulate the fast paced and bombastic action found in both Superhero comics and Wrestling. When combat happens, there\u2019s a lot happening at once, and the traditional \u201cone action per round\u201d system found in most tabletop games is completely at odds with that. In SuperLucha, dice are rolled based on how detailed, creative and flashy each move is, with the emphasis being on creativity and flair.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T12:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/0609bad8b7cfac1a834ed2f71425ac3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eden"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
