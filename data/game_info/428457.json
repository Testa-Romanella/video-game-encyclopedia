You take control of five surviving squad members \u2014 employees of the shady private military company \"Acronia\" \u2014 after an accident unleashes killer mutants on the base. Your only objective is to survive, get out, and kill anything that tries to stop you.</p>\n<strong>In development<br/></strong>\n<p><em>Acronia</em> has been in development since July 2019. Efforts began to ramp up the following January, with the goal of a digital <em>and</em> physical release \u2014 on actual floppy disks \u2014 by the end of 2020. The game runs on real DOS hardware and targets a 386 or better processor with VGA graphics.<br/></p>\n<p>This first release of <em>Acronia</em> (still in alpha, with a lot of work left to do) is author Clarissa's entry into DOS Games Jam.\u00a0 It's still incomplete, with a lot of missing features \u2014 more of a technical preview than an actual game at this point.
