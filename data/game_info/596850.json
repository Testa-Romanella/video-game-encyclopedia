It is based off an old iOS game called Font Monsters developed by MuuMuu way back in 2010, which doesn't exist anymore. I thought I'd try my hand at the base gameplay, but make it bigger and 3D. I call this guy El Qwerty.\u00a0I miss Font Monsters, so hopefully I'll continue with this and make a full fledged demo. Original mesh (now invisible) and animation from Mixamo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:10:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d35/d3597047df2251013e94671aedd5b4b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["tedAgriogianis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
