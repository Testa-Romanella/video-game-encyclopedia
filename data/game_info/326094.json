I didn't change much from where I left it, fixing some game breaking/aesthetic bugs and adding a crude flamethrower noise. This was intended to be the first entry of an ambitious (to say the least) six part series. The first five parts were to introduce five different bounty hunters/mercenaries and their origins while the sixth part was to put them all together for a massive heist. Each game was to have two chapters, one showing the mercenary in the past (origin) and the second in the present (to introduce new mechanics and their entire tool set). It's one of my favorite ideas that never worked and something that I may revive officially in the future just because of how much I like it.</p>\n<p>Along with the actual game, I've included a folder of some notes and unused sprites so that you can see some of the process behind it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T20:25:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95d54405b0fb6f4dc3b5f098bb201535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Curtis Lacey"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
