Help him get back to his home without being eaten or stomped by anything that could harm him!<br/><br/>This game was created for a GiAD and published on Dec, 31st, 2019. We are aware it's not the prettiest, the artist did the art in under 3 hours! The rest of the design took up the 22 Hours we spent building this project and we are very happy with how addicting (And nerve wrecking) it turned out. The quickest time to finish the game (with all the deaths included) is about three hours let me know if anyone beats that on a full run (Going back to start point does not reset your time, as that's how the game is designed)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:05:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72d/72d910567bbd88faf1474de64982b79c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raffile"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
