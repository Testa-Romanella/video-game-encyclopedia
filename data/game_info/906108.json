Petra rabbit's friends have been caught in cages by some dastardly foxes. Now its up to her to rescue them, and maybe enjoy some carrots along the way!.</p>\n<p>This game is inspired largely by Captain Toads Treasure Tracker. In each level you will use the WASD Keys to move Petra Rabbit around the field, and then by clicking and dragging your mouse you can rotate the world to see around obstacles, and obstructions. Now go rescue those rabbits. (And for our friends from France, Germany, and any other place that uses a non-QWERTY board (looking at you eastern Europeans) the arrow keys also work to move the character. If I had more time you guys would get the first class treatment but with only 48 hours this is the best I could do sorry).</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD - Move the character</p>\n<p>Left Click and Drag - Rotate the camera</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bdf2b3611f48b675f95debb0fe5357f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TheseusInABottle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
