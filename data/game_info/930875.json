{"id": 930875, "slug": "echoes-of-mayhem", "name": "Echoes of Mayhem", "name_original": "Echoes of Mayhem", "description": "Echoes of Mayhem is an arpg roguelite soulslike. You'll fight through a randomized dungeon of monsters and bosses in an attempt to reforge the world. You'll score loot along the way and gather resources to upgrade your town and choose your own path with random dungeon perks.<h3>EXPLORE A BROKEN WORLD</h3><br/>The world has been  ripped apart by a chaotic force. Make your way through dungeons in a quest to repair the shattered elemental islands. Then explore the restored pieces of these islands to finally confront the forces of Mayhem.<h3>CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY</h3><br/>Choose how you want to play with unique items and abilities. As you progress through the levels you will be given choices of powers called \"Echoes\" that will provide a unique experience with each playthrough and let you build your character how you want to play.  You can opt to slash your enemies with a giant sword, torch groups of skeletons with fireballs, or pull out a shield and wade through tons of enemies. There's even a full weapon combo system that rewards you with self buffs, damage to enemies, and target debuffs when the correct combo of weapon attacks is used.<h3>PUSH BACK THE FORCES OF MAYHEM</h3><br/>Make your way through randomized dungeons fighting packs of enemies and mini-bosses. At the end of each dungeon run you'll encounter a final level boss. Defeat them and you have a chance to bring back some elemental shards to restore the shattered islands.
