(Doesn\u2019t matter which \u2018M\u2019 comes first)</p><p>This game is a simple mouse click game.\r\n</p><p>1. Try to avoid the barriers.</p>\n<p>2. Click the candy.\r\n</p>\n<p>3. Congratulations! And press \u2018a\u2019 to restart.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>But to truly enjoy the game, you need a special mouse, not a mouse next you.\r\n</p>\n<p>Look at this mouse!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The 3D print mask is the main frame of the mouse. The normal mouse is set to the mask near the mouth position. Well, you can already guess. Just move the mouse pointer with your tongue. For the hygiene purposes, you can add a film to the laser tracking part of mouse and change it every time.\r\n</p><p>You can check this small LED for the mouse clicks.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The black box is the home of Arduino. You don't need to connect the mouse cable to your computer because it's made with a Bluetooth mouse.\u00a0But it needs power. So, I connect Arduino to the external battery. Then, you can move in Bluetooth area while moving the mouse pointer with your tongue without using your hands.\r\n</p><p>If you don\u2019t want to show your rough tongue movements for others, use a normal mask on the mouse. No one knows what you're doing.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I cannot give it to every user, You can make it freely. But do not sell.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>And don't forget it's my copyright.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This is art project by Joann Lee for St.interface Day at Art university Linz. </p><p>If you want more\u00a0information about me and my project, please visit my website and Instagram.\u00a0</p><p>Joan-n.com</p><p>www.instagram.com/joann_ys_lee</p><p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T12:29:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/065/0656dbf0d4e1b31846d2229f340c9acb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["JoannLee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
