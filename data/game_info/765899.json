{"id": 765899, "slug": "the-fallen-crown-prototype", "name": "The Fallen Crown (Prototype)", "name_original": "The Fallen Crown (Prototype)", "description": "<p>Cursed and fallen, you will unravel the mysteries of your past as you hunt for the truth behind the ancient monolith known only as 'The Tower'.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Play the way you want</strong></em>. Smash your way through obstacles and rush to the finish line, or be cautious and stealthy, taking your time to sneak up on enemies and scour every corner for secrets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At its heart,\u00a0<em>The Fallen Crown</em>\u00a0is a\u00a0<strong><em>Metroidvania</em></strong>. You will create many shortcuts in an interconnected world, while acquiring new skills and gear to reach new areas. You will wield daggers, staves, axes, throwing daggers or the classic sword and board, engaging in visceral combat. However, you will also have to be quick on your 'feet'. You'll find yourself jumping off of ledges, pouncing on enemy heads and shooting projectiles more in line with classic games like\u00a0<strong><em>Super Mario</em></strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong><em>Megaman</em></strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>NOTE: This demo was made using the GB Studio version 2.5. I'm currently rebuilding the game using version 3.0 to take advantage of all the new features. While I might address a few bugs, there will be no major updates until the new version is caught up to this one.</p>\r\nKey Features\r\n<p>\u2022 Jump, run, smash and shoot your way to victory.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 Upgrade your gear, stats and skills to stay alive(ish).\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 Explore a unique and interconnected world, full of secret areas and colorful characters\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 Use your trusty map to mark your progress and track down elusive artifacts.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 Change classes on the fly to meet every challenge.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 Master the art of combat to defeat powerful bosses.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 Depending on your mastery of the genre, you can expect 20-30 minutes of gameplay.<br/></p>Tips and Tricks\r\n<p>Tutorials and tips are pretty limited in this prototype, so here are a few things that may not be clearly communicated:\r\n</p>\n<p>-Yes, the A and B buttons are mapped incorrectly in this version. That is the default setting in this version of GB Studio, they will be flipped in the new version.\r\n</p>\n<p>-Some enemies can be jumped on to stun or damage, some cannot. I\u00a0won't spoil which is which.\r\n</p>\n<p>-Press 'up' on the D pad to interact with objects. In addition to doors and chests, you will find notes and certain desks/journals you will need to read in order to progress.\r\n</p>\n<p>-You may find a using a torch in dark areas may lead to some interesting finds. You can also use the torch to light wall torches in completely dark rooms.\r\n</p>\n<p>-Press 'select' while in your inventory to view your map.\u00a0 Certain items you find will reveal treasure chests and hidden items.\r\n</p>\n<p>-Firing projectiles and some successful shield blocks will consume energy.\u00a0 Conserve your energy for when you really need it. Just like real life.\r\n</p>Want More?\r\n<p>Visit\u00a0atavistgames.com\u00a0to check out the progress on the new version and other cool stuff! I'm a one man team, but\u00a0I try to update the News and Dev Blog pages and much as possible.
