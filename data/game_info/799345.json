Players choose one of the 14 factions (13 historical factions and one custom faction) to play. By summoning teammates, they can fight monsters, upgrade equipment, learn skills, and then attack cities and seize land when the team is strong enough to unify the world. In addition to the main line of occupying the city and unifying the world, this game also provides three copy playing methods: Dan medicine secret place, ancient sword tomb, Shura martial arts arena and a hidden ultimate boss. Players can obtain various pills to improve the character's attributes in the pill secret place. In the ancient sword tomb, players can challenge ancient famous generals to obtain ancient equipment. In the Shura martial arts arena, players can obtain gold coins through PK custom teams. The final hidden boss has the ability to be powerful and very challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you have ever played the FC version of the devouring heaven and earth series, or are particularly fond of the Three Kingdoms background games, this game will certainly give you a different experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T04:48:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8a/f8a52edd3c1af12ae7f0a1b32af86978.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u8d5a\u5927\u94b1\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u8d5a\u5927\u94b1\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
