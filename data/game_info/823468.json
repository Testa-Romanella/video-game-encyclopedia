Whilst being the ninth entry to be made for the main series, it is also the direct sequel of &#39;Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a All Star&#39;. Unlike before, the game does not have a primary focus on either band, which encourages the player to select the latest routes they would prefer to take; having a more mature theme in mind. It received a special edition from the bundle called &#39;Sweet &amp; Bitter Box&#39;, as well as a remaster for the Nintendo Switch.</p>\n<h2>Description Translation:</h2>\n<p>This game will focus on the 4 senior idols. Combining those 4 with the 7 junior idols from the original series, there will be a total 11 idols with routes! The game is split into two main grand routes; the &quot;Quartet Route&quot;, featuring the 4 seniors, and the &quot;Rainbow Route&quot;, featuring the 7 juniors. Both grand routes are then further divided into the individual idols&#39; routes.</p>\n<h2>~ Quartet Route ~</h2>\n<p>The story of the Quartet Route takes place after the events of Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a All Star. It begins with Nanami Haruka and her chosen partner already as lovers. What is in the future that awaits Haruka and her beloved?</p>\n<h2>~ Rainbow Route ~</h2>\n<p>This will be a story about the 7 juniors, who are now all fully-fledged idols. Like the Quartet Route, the story begins with Haruka and her chosen partner already as lovers. Here, you&#39;ll be able to read stories about her sparkling, happy days spent with her boyfriend, who&#39;s now shining as an idol.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T23:22:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c0592337810a33bb459161515887f5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PSP"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Broccoli"], "esrb_rating": null}
