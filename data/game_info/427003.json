Skillfully maneuver the cube from side to side while keeping the balance of sides in check. It starts out hard, and\u00a0gets even harder as you progress. How long can you keep up? Can you reach the highest of levels and join the legends?</p>\n<p>Hand made with love in 72 hours for ScoreSpace Jam #8 with a theme of <strong>balance\u00a0</strong>(https://itch.io/jam/scorejam8).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>- Use\u00a0<strong>A</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>D</strong>\u00a0to roll and <strong>move </strong>the cube left and right,\u00a0<br/><strong>- S</strong>\u00a0to apply downward force to bring the cube down faster for more advanced maneuvering<br/>-\u00a0<strong>SPACE\u00a0</strong>to <strong>jump </strong>and <strong>double jump\u00a0</strong>(note:\u00a0using the double jump instantly after jumping yields worse results than using it when you are the peak of the first jump, so it's better to use it at a very last moment before you start falling down again!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay<br/></strong>- Double jumps are reset only after touching the top of platform (not from sides!)<br/>- Keep the balance in check by collecting platforms from both sides.<br/>- When touching colored platform, the balance shifts other direction.<br/>- Consecutive jumps on same colored platforms give less score.<br/>-\u00a0Score per platform increases the higher you get, but so does the difficulty.<br/>- You will lose if you let other color touch other edge of the browser, or if you get caught up by the camera</p>\n<p>High scores are stored locally in browser.</p>\n<p>A game by Sami Orko &amp; Daniel \u00d6sterman.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:51:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f28/f286ca7b8c5d7635002391e2ac7de716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sorko"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
