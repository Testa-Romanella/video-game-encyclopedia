I think I got like Kung-fu on the NES, Tetris on the GameBoy, something else, and this game. At the time I thought it was just some game I didn't recognize. I played through it and thought it was pretty neat, if not a bit weird. It didn't seem like a game that would've come out in the GameBoy's time, but I didn't think much of it. Anyway, I didn't touch it for a while until recently. I've been moving apartments and while packing I found the game cart for this game. I played it again and remembered how weird it was. It has this weird story about a monster and I think their sister, but like it's all eerie because there's no sound anywhere. It's just... odd. I decided to Google it but I haven't been able to find ANYTHING on it. I even contacted some of my friends that are super into obscure retro games, and even they had never heard of this game. I borrowed one of their rom dumpers and dumped the game, so here you go. I think it's a really nice little game, with some flaws of course, as any game has. Play it if you wish.</p><p>Join my Discord I\u00a0guess?
