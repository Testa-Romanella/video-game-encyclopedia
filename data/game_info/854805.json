Every fall, terrible creatures assault your village, disrupting the peace and taking hundreds of lives. You must take the fight to them! Summon your seasonal companion and bring back the safe and cozy Autumn you so dearly miss.</p>\n<p>Controls: Mouse(Click skill, click enemy, click GO.) Spacebar opens the map. There's currently a bug where a certain event may not reward an Evolution Crystal, super sorry if that causes any frustration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made for\u00a0Cozy Autumn Game Jam (2022)<br/></p>\n<p>Made in Gdevelop with Aseprite for art, Jumm Box for music, and jfxr for sounds.<br/></p>\n<p>I over scoped this pretty hard. I really thought I could make 5 or so unique skills for each creature, but time wouldn't allow it. I was going for a mash up of Pokemon meets Slay the Spire, but with only one skill each, it's severely stunted the gameplay. Still, I wanted to get it as far along as I\u00a0could before the submission period ends. Anyways, thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:37:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/470/470c0ac0659c1749e0b6735c1aa13263.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["NUTT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
