This one is for those seeking a more relaxed play.</p>\n<p>Timed, as the name suggests, has the player taking out furniture from one house and placing them in another within a time limit. The amount and type of furniture the player manages to move determines the final score.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/163/1636b41d875f5be32b053e348a83cea0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["glazed"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
