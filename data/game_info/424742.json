It is a followup to the \"Reconstruction\" series released in 2009.</p>\n<p>This game is no longer in active development. I am sharing it here to fix a critical issue that has cropped up in more recent versions of Windows. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>VERSION 1.4 (Updated March 31st, 2020): This version includes a fix to allow keyboard shortcuts to work on modern computers. It also includes a small buff to the stats of custom characters, which should make things easier for young adventurers.</p>\n<p>See more of my work at www.spacelizard.dev\u00a0or contact me on twitter at @sungazersoft.</p><p>(April 2nd) The previous download had an issue with achievements and bestiary data.
