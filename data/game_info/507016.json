Capturing the flag is 100pts and the first team to 300 wins. There are various point variations for Kills, depending on where you and the target are (on home turf or enemy territory). Since the game is played with Lasers,\u00a0 there are no pickups. Instead, find the Recharge Stations located throughout the map to RECHARGE your weapons. You can also Heal at the Med Stations, but those only work for you on your own territory. Controls are basic WASD, Space=jump, R=Reload, LMB=Shoot, and RMB=aim. You can also toggle Sprint with the L-Shift key and if you hold the Space bar/Jump in-front of a ladder you will climb it, but it's not automatic, so be focused when attempting those climbs. Spent many hours working on this, but had a blast. Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/226/2269621c2b8860c09e73ab4d2b715cc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juxto"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
