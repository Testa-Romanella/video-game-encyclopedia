The various environmental hazards underline      this feature, which are not only deadly to you, but also to your enemies.\r\n </li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Fly through space and overcome a variety of enemies and obstacles as one of three completely different classes.</p>\n<p>As the <em>Fighter</em>, fire a weapon that is very weak at start, but covers an increasingly larger area if you keep on destroying enemies. Additionally, you can copy the attacks of your enemies by destroying three of a kind in a row.</p>\n<p>As the <em>Survivor</em>, gain energy by daring to get close to enemy attacks. Use this energy to either block attacks or wait for maximum energy to perform a screen-filling attack. If you manage to reach a high speed, your ship enters ghost-mode and becomes invincible.</p>\n<p>Finally, as the <em>Trickster</em>, perform various risky maneuvers to unleash powerful attacks. Wield a boomerang that is deadly to your enemies, but takes away your control over your ship. Use energy to drag a box that inflicts great damage and returns enemy attack damage back at the enemy. Destroy your foes by simply crashing into them while having enough speed.</p>\n<p>Learn to master <em>Quick Slick Deadly</em> through step-by-step missions and then show off the hard-core gamer within you with your perfected high-scores and excellent completion times.
