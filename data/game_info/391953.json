I had to learn a bit about the language and how to use this tool and I do say I quite like it. This game is a very basic one. You use the arrow keys to move and try not to collide with the shuriken that jump around the screen. See how long you can last by checking the timer in the top right of the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a bonus achievement, this game is also my first HTML export!</p>\n<p>Also, if you wish to quit the game just press the back button on the browser or just reset the page I haven't found a way to close the game yet. I hope that this is not too much of an issue.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and I hope to hear feedback!</p>\n<p>-Caleb (LebbyFoxx)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T03:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/677ebb5857a6fdd412de715e22ecd9d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
