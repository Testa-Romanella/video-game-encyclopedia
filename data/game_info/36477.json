In the magic academy where hundreds of scholars should be, none can be found...<br/><br/>Keepsake will immerse you into a journey beyond compare. Assisted by a dragon afraid of height, Lydia takes on to explore the academy\u2019s empty structures in search for her best friend Celeste. <br/><br/>Curiosity turns to worry when she stumbles on something she has not seen in a very long time: an old doll, a keepsake she gave her best friend some 8 years ago. As she grabs it, strange images of Celeste\u2019s life begin to fill her mind...<br/><br/>Do they hold the answer behind the scholars\u2019 disappearances mystery?<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Keepsake was a labor of love developed 10 years ago by us as an independent studio. For its anniversary, we thought it would be great to see it live again on steam and gain a new following, as we feel that it is still relevant today. It was hard and long, but we loved developing it and still remember those days fondly :)<br/><br/>It's a point-and-click style adventure game blending 3d and 2d which would be perfect for anyone looking for a slower-paced style of game, with great imagery and touching story about a father and his daughter.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-23T11:29:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c1334ef76c4cbfeca23b5e7b6b8b1bd.jpg", "website": "http://www.keepsakegame.com", "rating": 3.93, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 82, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 565, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wicked Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["The Adventure Company", "Wicked Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
