Our Protagonist is late for Office and has a medical condition called Nitro Fart Disorder. Due to which he can fly through farting. But there's also risk of pooping in his own pants. To replenish Fart, you've to eat and to prevent yourself from soiling you've to use Toilets. The end goal is to get to the Portal at the top of the Office building. Do comment about what did you liked and dislike about the game. Thank You for the Opportunity.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T02:46:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bb/5bb7e6b112e20375e9b8c32ba0243042.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dewangan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
