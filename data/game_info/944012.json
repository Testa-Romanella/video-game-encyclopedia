Disassemble, abstractly used as you disassemble and reassemble on death.</p>\n<p>Welcome to <em>Digital Dreams: Fragmented Memories</em>. This is yet another game where my ambitions beat my abilities and I was not able to add everything I had hoped. The inspirations for this game were the Gameboy Zelda games and Tron.\u00a0It was more difficult than I imagined making fun and interesting puzzles so the game is a lot shorter than I had hoped. Either way I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Do not worry about dying not progress is lost. You will be disassembled and re-assembled back to the rooms checkpoint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Shoot</p>\n<p>Q - Bomb (once unlocked)- Can destroy some walls.</p>\n<p>E - Backup (once unlocked) - Sets a backup marker. Pressing the key again instantly returns you to the backup.</p><p>M - Mute audio.</p><p>Credits</p><p>Audio -\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/action-music-pack-1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T06:59:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/149583823edfeb8cad9cba7786445ab3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hexadecimalwtf"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
