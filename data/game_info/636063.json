You can jump on slimes, and bounce off slime balloons. You can jump up \u2014 or off \u2014 walls.\r\n</p>\n<p>If a slime knocks you out, or if you land on spikes, you will lose 5 gold. Gold is worth 1, and video game treasures/large gold bricks are worth 10. Try to collect as much gold and treasure as you can!\r\n</p>\n<p>Best played with a controller!</p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Krystman\r\n</li><li>Nerdy Teachers\r\n</li><li>ViNull\r\n</li><li>MBoffin</li></ul>\n<p>Though \"complete\", it isn't very long, and ends abruptly.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>My intention was to just mess around with PICO-8, but after watching Krystman (Lazy Devs) talk about the importance of finishing your first game (in\u00a0this\u00a0video), I felt compelled to get it in a finished state and put it out, before moving on to start something new.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game, and pardon the bugs, code, art, and lack of background music! x)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T08:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24d/24d14fb38945361c66db1539785f0da0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["johnkdbell"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
