{"id": 617638, "slug": "close-call-aviraldg", "name": "Close Call (aviraldg)", "name_original": "Close Call (aviraldg)", "description": "<p><strong>Close Call </strong>is a game where you play a telephone interchange operator and try to connect people with similar interests.</p>\n<p>Calls appear periodically (and at an increasing rate) with icons symbolizing interests, and you must connect similar interests.</p>\n<p><strong>To connect calls, click on a phone which has interests next to it and is ringing to connect one end of the cable, and then click on a phone on the other side of the screen which is also ringing (you cannot connect calls on the same side of the screen.) Interests disappear when you connect one side of the cable, so you must remember which phones you want to connect.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Each caller will wait 10 seconds before disconnecting, and if you do not connect them in that time you lose Customer Satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Your Customer Satisfaction starts out at 100, and the game ends when it hits 0.</p>\n<p>Once you connect a pair of callers, they start talking, and this conversation lasts for 10 seconds. Once a conversation ends, you get points.</p>\n<p>The points you get are 10 times the number of interests you got in common divided by the number of cables that overlapped with the cable for that conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>You should try to maximize the number of common interests, minimize overlapping cables, and avoid dropping calls.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You lose points for connecting callers with no common interests.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: There is a bug due to which restarting the game using the prompt at the end of the game may not work correctly. Please refresh to restart the game. The game cannot be updated at the moment as it is a GMTK 2021 submission.</strong></p>\n<p>Team:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Lucas Mercanti (LMerca) - Music, Sound, Testing,\u00a0Game\u00a0Design</li><li>Aviral Dasgupta (aviraldg) - Game Design, Code, Testing</li><li>16-bit.exe - Game\u00a0Design</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Noto Emoji by Google</li><li>Number Blocks by\u00a0GameArtForge</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c046ca869b4bf52ae79f9d3fded4a09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aviraldg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
