UFO's, living mannequins, evil harpsichords: it seems every single baddie wants to decimate the poor town and its inhabitants. Thankfully, a band of animals has teamed up, creating a club of heroes, ready and willing to take on whatever foe rears its head. They\u2019re on a time crunch, though- they only have seven days before that week\u2019s villain reduces Resopolis to rubble.</p>\n<p>In <em><strong>Hero Mode</strong></em>, your goal is to protect the city of Resopolis as long as you can, strategically choosing who should head into battle, and what supplies they need to bring with them. Each boss defeated gives you a nice stack of money, which can be used to buy power-ups to make the next boss easier to beat. (And you\u2019ll need it: the bosses only get faster and stronger as time goes on!) Our heroes can also choose to spend some time working for the local businesses, if they wind up strapped for cash. Regardless, they have to subdue the weekly monster in time, or else Resopolis will destroyed.</p>\n<p>After spending some time defending the city, why not try out <strong><em>Freeplay Mode</em></strong>? In this mode, you can battle\u00a0any previously-fought enemy with\u00a0any character\u00a0and item setup you wish. On top of that, you can\u00a0also set the week manually, letting you challenge yourself\u00a0against the monsters\u00a0at\u00a0any difficulty you like.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>To navigate both the menus\u00a0and the game itself, you can use the\u00a0arrow keys, space bar,\u00a0and Z key. When in battle, you'll find tha each of the four playable\u00a0characters are\u00a0unique- they have different\u00a0amounts of health, deal different\u00a0amounts of damage,\u00a0and even have special skills that can be\u00a0activated with the right shift key. The\u00a0assortment of items for sale can diversify your line-up even further!</p>\n<p>\tIn this demo of Monster of the Week, you'll get the option\u00a0to play two minigames to earn money,\u00a0and you'll get\u00a0to battle eight randomly chosen bosses who\u2019ll get tougher the longer you play. How long can you protect Resopolis?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T04:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4e08ef47a6d80b1a01a9f026b72a84c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["robert0504"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
