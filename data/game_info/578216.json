To rescue her he must find her first, so he'll have to yell near the houses to make her come out.  The aliens will chase Breadly when they spot him so stay out of their sight or make sure to run away. Yelling and running cost stamina so be careful how and when you run or yell. After finding grandma you'll have to hurry to the bakery to bring her to safety.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou'll get 10 levels which all have 3 game modes, such as bonus objectives or cloaked enemies for higher difficulty. Every completed level will give you a star and you'll need those to unlock the levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T03:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/205/20596606c512a6d7844ab26753e41e44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lvl8Landlord"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Webcode Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
