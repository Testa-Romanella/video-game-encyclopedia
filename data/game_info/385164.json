Fortunately alien technology can help in the form of a remote cow controller but there is a side effect, every time a cow moves she loses a bit of energy so it is better to move her to a place with some food unless you want it to die. After she eats she poops where she is; this will help to grow her food a bit faster.</p>\n<p><strong>How long will you be able to keep the cow alive?<br/></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T05:38:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/522/522125e24161dc98976d80d53c83349c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["minasss"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
