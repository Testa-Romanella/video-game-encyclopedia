The world is filled with GMC users who made the GMC Jam the success it is today, and it even features an in-game museum of all 20 GMC Jams to date.</p>\n<p>If you perform a gift-trading sequence in the right order, you'll be able to unlock the door to Club Dadio and defeat the crazy final boss.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ff5fbc0c96eea9ef04448919033c013.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameDevDan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
