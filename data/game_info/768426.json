You'll need to buy and upgrade the best cars you can if you hope to clear all 20 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<p>From the main menu you can choose which cars to buy, which stats to upgrade, and which races to take part in.<br/></p>\n<p>You can also revise for and then take the test of your choice. Both tests are multiple choice and have a variety of questions.</p>\n<p>Completing the tests will reward you with money to buy and upgrade new cars, and will also icrease your available energy; energy you'll need to take part in the races.</p>\n<p>In the races themselves swipe left or right to move your car (on PC click and drag left/right). Avoid other cars on the road and try and collect the required number of 'L-Plates' to complete the level before you run out of fuel.</p>\n<p>You can also pickup fuel refill cans to extend your playtime, and coins to take back to your garage.</p>\n<p><strong>Important Information:</strong></p>\n<p>This app was designed as a test of programming and design skills. While the questions and information regarding UK driving theory and road laws have been taken from official sources, I would strongly reccomend you do not treat this as a primary source for learning driving theory. There are much better sources of information out there that have been verified by official governing bodies.<br/></p>\n<p>The purpose of this project was to gamify the revision process and was designed with the game side at the forefront. There are only a handful of questions for each quiz that do not cover everything you would need to know to sit a real driving theory test,\u00a0and as such, the current version of this project should be viewed as a scalable prototype.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T06:31:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c35/c35374bbc6ba0fb5bb3fe6cb635d094a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BadBackGames"], "genres": ["Racing", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
