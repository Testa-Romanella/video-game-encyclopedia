The ring remind me of something being looped or never ending, so this game\u00a0is inspired by Loop hero. And Player being a boxer is just an addition flavor related to the theme.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it, Most of the medieval boxer don't last long on their profession so don't expect you will. Live like the old time where the boxer fight every single day for a mere coins. Lucky for you, your coach left you 12 g to start your journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credits to:</p>\n<p>Kenny - in game asset</p>\n<p>alkakrab - BGM</p>\n<p>other asset can be found on the GDevelop Asset Store\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T21:34:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/954/9542a454b4179bf08d4d0f2952416be6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["offshiftgamedev"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
