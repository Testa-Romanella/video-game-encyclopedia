I plan to develop more to it as time passes, but this is what it will exist as for a while as I\u00a0am a full time student and I have other projects I work on as well. Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T03:39:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfad3a5c5d20b7c56d0dba1ce38d816b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FictionOddityGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
