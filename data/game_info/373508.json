The action begins in Los Angeles&#39; Little Tokyo district where the elusive &quot;Gokudo-Kai&quot; organized crime family is suspected of illegal weapons smuggling. As a police officer looking for the opportunity to rise in rank, players embark on a special assignment to apprehend the Gokudo-Kai members and crack down on criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Police 24/7 features remarkable USB motion sensor technology, requiring players to move their entire bodies to perform realistic manoeuvres such as dodging bullets, peering around corners and laying low to take cover. A compatible USB camera is required for the motion-sensor--Konami recommend an Omnivision camera--but the game&#39;s playable with just a light gun or in fact even a standard controller. The fast-paced action intensifies as players fight a crime ring that spans from Los Angeles to the bustling Japanese city of Shinjuku. Players progress throughout the game to earn performance-based points, which will eventually lead to the coveted title of Commissioner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-11T09:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee3/ee3f7d9fb6683d6f21147c756e6db51a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
