The game operates nearly identically to the original, as laid out in the Pac-Man Dossier (here). Minimal changes were made where I deemed appropriate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T14:17:05", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ICleanPools"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
