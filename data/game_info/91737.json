But in return, each relic compels its bearer to enter a mysterious tower from which no Summoners seem to return...<br/><br/>Starting with only a few meager powers and a weak demon ally bound to your relic, you must climb the tower, recruiting stronger demons and learning new skills in order to survive.<br/><br/>Though each relic is powerful, they still have limits: They only allow you to command - not directly control - the demons you encounter, and the powers you can acquire from these allies will never eclipse those of the mightiest demons within the tower. Without powerful, well-chosen allies and clever use of the abilities learned from them, there will be no chance of survival...</p>\n\n<br/>Features\r\n<p>(specifics on content amounts reflect current content as of 7/3/2018, not final goals)</p>\n<ul><li>The 23 floor tower awaits you, its layout generated anew each game.</li><li>Over 150 different demons to recruit and summon as allies.</li><li>More than 650 different abilities you and your demon allies can learn.</li><li>Rich, detailed in-game descriptions drawn from real world mythology for each demon.</li></ul>\n\n<br/>7/3/2018 Update Highlights\r\n<ul><li>Multiple save slots: You can now have up to eight games\u00a0in progress concurrently.</li><li>A few additional bug fixes.</li></ul>\n\n<br/>System Requirements\r\n<p>Demon runs on Windows XP SP2+, Mac OS X 10.8+, and Ubuntu 12.04+.
