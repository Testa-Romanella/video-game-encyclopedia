There is no one left to attend to the yard - so it is time to make your escape to greener lawns.</p>\n<p>However, the previous tenants left all sorts of dangers between you and escape.</p>\n<p>Don't fear! Your friends are here to cheer you on. Whenever you can break your focus enough to hear their cheers you'll be inspired to leap to heights you've never reached before!</p>\n<p>Together, you can escape!</p>\n<p><em>Mechanics</em></p>\n<p>Periodically, you'll hear the cheers of your friends. When this happens a series of arrows will appear on the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>By entering the series of arrows in the correct order (from left-to-right) you will gain inspiration (air-jump charge) - noted by the green number above your head.</p>\n<p>You can always jump off the ground, but to jump in the air you will need to use some inspiration!</p>\n<p>Watch out for the dangers though. There are holes in the lawn to fall into, and old tools left lying around. Both of which will end your escape!</p>\n<p><em>Controls</em><br/></p>\n<p>Start Running -&gt;\u00a0Spacebar</p>\n<p>Jump -&gt; Spacebar</p>\n<p>Match Arrows -&gt; Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Restart -&gt; R</p>\n\n<p><em>Why</em><br/></p>\n<p>A group 4 decided to make this for our very first game jam.
