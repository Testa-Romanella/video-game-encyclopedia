The art needs a lot of work, and the platforming itself isn't all that fun. The music was also something very quickly made so I'm sure gets boring fast.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T03:54:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0f/e0f80db944a4ce6ea7ee9a11a04acc70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ihansson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
