It took root in rich soil and slowly, over time, grew into a massive tree the likes of which no one had ever seen before.\u201d\r\n  </li><li>\u201cAfter many millennia had passed, the trees roots had spread far and wide, choking the life out of the planet that nourished it.\u201d\r\n  </li><li>\u201cFrom the tree blossomed a single flower, a young woman of unparalleled beauty. she travelled far to reach the kingdom, and slowly over time used her magic to exert influence over the king. she was determined to grow the tree at any cost, convincing the king to subject his subjects to her end goal.\u201d\r\n  </li><li>\u201can elderly wizard, an advisor to the king, was suspicious of this woman who appeared from nowhere. He pleaded with the king, but his cries fell on deaf ears. The king wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d\r\n  </li><li>\u201cEventually, the king\u2019s final days drew near. He bestowed the kingdom to the strange woman, and with her new position, she began to lead a brutal reign, quietly eliminating any citizens who dared opposed her.\u201d\r\n  </li><li>\u201cThe advisor was furious, and stepped down from his position in protest. While he traveled back to his home on a remote piece of land far from the castle, he noticed knights of the emerald queen, as she was known, followed him. They drew their swords and engaged in combat. The wizard repelled them for a time, but eventually a knight managed to strike him with a mortal wound.\u201d\r\n  </li><li>\u201cThe wizard staggered slowly to his secret chamber where he hid magical artifacts that he had accrued throughout his life. mere minutes before his passing, he used the last of his magic to bind his soul to a strange ancient armor he had unearthed from a civilization long past\u201d\r\n  </li><li>\u201cNow possessing the armor, he picked up a spear and shield and slayed the murderous knights. He then drew his gaze back to the emerald queen, and swore his revenge.\u201d\r\n  </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T14:48:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54d/54d01c0d4c10aaedc2d89f0904367e34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROC Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
