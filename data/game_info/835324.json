You edit the bot's AI every day to make it either accept, reject, or kill crossers. There is no real win or lose condition, just 4 different endings that you can get depending on what you make the AI do.</p>\n\n<p>All art and code were made by me, and the audio was made using SFXR.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T07:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46e/46ec6b46df2fabcbb4e61c237e157314.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dat1Doge"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
