When he was young, he was told tales of his famed ancestor Cyan, that ventured into the depths of the notoriously dangerous castle known as Xie Huo Jing Ling (\u90aa\u706b\u7cbe\u7075). He left behind his hat, and passed down this message, \u201cWhoever is able to attain my hat shall be bestowed the title, Indiana\u201d. Generations passed, with each descendant failing to do so. It is now up to Blu to prove that he has what is takes and make his family proud.</p>\n<p>You play as a bird called Blu.
