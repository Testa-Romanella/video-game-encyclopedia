There are 3 difficulties: Slow, Fast, and Hyper. Fast is recommended for most players. It is my first game, so I hope you enjoy it :D Sorry, the screen is a little smaller in itch.io than in unity so it is a little close up, hope you don't mind.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T10:10:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b3b27ae3e5f0806f2aeec4957361d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TazerGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
