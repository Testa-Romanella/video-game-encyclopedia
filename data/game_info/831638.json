Transition into a land of anxiety, adrenalin, and pure evil, as the player fights darkness with their trusty set of matchsticks. Taking place in a familiar sweet and safe town, that seems almost desolate as a full moon rises.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\"<strong><em>A Walk Home</em></strong>\" was my very first attempt at a complete game (or complete prototype). Though it has its bugs here and there, it was a very proud moment when I finally handed it in as my own project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For context, I created this game in 3 weeks. It\u00a0was the first instalment of a mini-game development unit within my University course. As I post this, it has been 6 months since the development of \"A Walk Home\", and looking back I see what I could have improved upon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hopefully, with these points of improvement,\u00a0I can\u00a0share more and more projects with you in the future.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Thanks for your time, hope you are having a lovely day!</em></p>\n<p>Saarsha</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T18:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4b/a4b24bf6a86ac84934c73a2b0f12d261.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["saarsha.exe"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
