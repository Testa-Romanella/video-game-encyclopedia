Each level contains a star fragment that you need to collect before you return to the rocket that takes you to the next level. Once you\u2019ve completed all the levels, increase the level of difficulty and try again. How far can you get?</p>\r\nGame-Play Video\r\n\r\nMaking-Of Time-Lapse &amp; Narrated Post Mortem Video", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b8c4432ae6a6483d2cf819049f8d2d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["imphenzia"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
