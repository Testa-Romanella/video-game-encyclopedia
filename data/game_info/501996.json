The walls, the floors, everything is falling apart.\u00a0You must do what you can to survive and reach the exit.<br/></p>\n<p>TERMINUS is a PSX-styled survival\u00a0horror game in the veins of classic titles such as Silent Hill, developed by Hades and adc.</p>\n<p>This project started out as a fan project because I really liked\u00a0Silent Hill and wanted to test out the waters with Unity and Crocotile.</p>\n<p>This was made for a friend that is no longer around. I put a lot of time, effort and sleepless nights into this demo; took a few years. This project is more of a programming experiment because I got to program something I never tried before: Multi-language support, dynamic camera, saving system as well as being a fully functional PSX game.\u00a0I decided to not let this go to waste and release it for people to play. It's not much, but it's something I'm proud of.\u00a0This was a fun learning experience, and I plan on making a full game out of this some day.</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: This game was originally designed for Windows, but we have included Mac and Linux ports for availability.\u00a0</strong><strong>There may be issues but we might not be able to fix most of them due to not having a Mac or a Linux for testing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks to Crocotile3D: </strong>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244040/Crocotile_3D/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T07:12:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/980/9804ec967882d2241e92b81994d061c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["adc", "Hades"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
