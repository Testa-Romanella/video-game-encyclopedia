Why? No one knows. Does this all make sense? No, it doesn't. Is the game finished?\u00a0No, it isn't\u00a0 Of course it is. Are your fellow beans having a rave. Hell yeah!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Explore [read: walk through corridor] a\u00a0glitchy and buggy perfectly intentional world in which you face horrifying beans which\u00a0float, have no faces and press trigger real fast. Please just don't run/walk through the walls. The bean gods don't like it and will punish you with eternal falling. Walls do have colliders, what do you mean?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Reported issues\u00a0features:</p>\n<ul><li>They can glitch us out bad and deeper you go they may glitch you harder\u00a0</li><li>Some known symptoms are literally squishing the damn guns. (I don't know how they  do it.)</li><li>They might be able to make walls as an illusion.</li><li>If you crouch and and move then you maybe be able to actually just jump [HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK??]</li></ul>\n<p>The beans are breaking the world. Join up your guns (to the power sources) and make it not that way. That's it.<br/></p>\n<p>No beans were harmed in the making. Not any that I know of, at least.</p>\r\nTeam:\r\nDesign\r\n<ul><li>slightlybonkers</li><li>VJ</li></ul>\r\nProgramming\r\n<ul><li>Zanderlof</li><li>HummusMan</li><li>Ishan</li></ul>\r\nArt\r\n<ul><li>Wesu</li><li>Chaotic</li></ul>\r\nSound\r\n<ul><li>Chopov1</li><li>LienoLieno666</li></ul>\r\nTesting\r\n<ul><li>Sapient44</li></ul>\n<p><strong>In all seriousness: This may not be the most finished game ever. If you still decide to play it, please don't go into the walls. Thanks!
