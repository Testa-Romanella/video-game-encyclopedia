You might die a lot at the beginning, here are some hints how to progress faster:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Play the game at your own paste. Don't try to get every item you can.</li><li>Always look ahead. Back-tracking it not always worth it.</li><li>There is one river (big amount of water) on every map. Think of it as a save harbour.</li><li>In the early game it's better to wait beside your plant instead of wandering of. For melons and apples it's the exact opposite.</li><li>The end game starts at level 25. Come prepared. The best level to stock up food is between level 12 and 16. After that the food supplies steadily recline.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:21:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a1/6a12f1ad83327c7928aea32c708bb39d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Orasund"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
