Do you love to see Youtube videos regarding dominoes?</p>\n<p>Now you can play dominoes with your phone, and do sets of lines as long as you want.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>You need the Android APP and a set of cards. You can use either the virtual set, to be used in another phone, TV, or tablet... or you can use the printable set to print them.</p>\n<p>You need to scan the card, and when it is scanned, click on it to go to edit mode (and to scan a card again click the card button again). With one finger you can move through the virtual grid and with two fingers you can rotate and zoom your visualization.</p>\n<p>Rotate your set, put it wherever you want, and add copies of it as you wish. Finally, when you have ended. Click on play<br/></p>\n<p>There are some important sets of cards with some special features, but it is explained in the game.</p>\r\nWhy?\r\n<p>This game is partly a failed experiment, the original was to put a set of pieces in the real world, through AR cards, to play domino. Unfortunately, the idea didn't work for current AR limitations (position reset by itself, breaking everything) so I had to reformulate this game.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I worked hard on it so I made some changes to the original idea to let it work. Because, why not? It is a domino. I can look at falling domino pieces for hours and hours on youtube. So it is fun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:19:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90c/90c84dc5bcd40c67e5e7c9e3bb9ae451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josep Pons"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
