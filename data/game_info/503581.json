And while doing with the spatial-temporal anomalies, because why not? Although the dungeon seems pretty small, there's more to it than you think. You need to go find a key, and return to the exit. It's simple as that.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WSAD/Cursor - movement</li><li>LMB - Main gun</li><li>RMB - Mortar</li></ul>\n<p>Shop is available once in a while - follow the green arrow to get into.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips and tricks:</strong></p>\n<p>If you keep dying, take it slow. Buy a cheap weapon, if you can - it really helps.</p>\n<p>Enemies hit with temporal beam advance forward in time, from basic units to experienced, from fresh corpses to welded-into the floor husks. Reverse is also true - if the road is blocked by enemy corpse, try to go back and see what happens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What's worse then mines? Mines with walls spawn on top of them. Sorry about that.<br/>Sometimes red bots emerge from underground to catch you unprepared and kill you. Sorry about that, too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:10:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81c/81c1e05c9e48dbd0773970cab76216e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Volcanic Giraffe", "icxon", "a333"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
