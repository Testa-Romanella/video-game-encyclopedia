But the only input you have to move your character is the space bar. Your character is still quite capable though, because each spacebar press cycles through 1. Move left\u00a0 2. Jump\u00a0 3. Move right\u00a0 4. Jump.\u00a0 Once you get a sense of the pattern you'll find that one input is all you need.<br/>There are 15 levels split into Easy, Medium, and Hard. And fair warning, hard means hard.<br/></p><p>Thanks for playing and rating!</p><p>Good luck gamers.<br/>-Thxrst</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T09:43:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e6a16574919d692c16ae51874c44a9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Thxrst"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
