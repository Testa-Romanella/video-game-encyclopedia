Love?</p>\n<p><strong>(** The romance part is of main character Sachiel Devereux and Luca H. Heidegger.\u00a0Other characters are not romance-able.)</strong></p>\r\n&gt;&gt;CHARACTERS\r\nSachiel Devereux\r\n\n<p>An owner of a cafe. Loves cute things and artsy decorations. Bright and joyful, his own past is a constant reminder to see his future in better light!</p>\r\nLuca H. Heidegger\r\n\n<p>A soldier. Intimidating at first, but his actual personality shines through. With time and effort, he will forgive himself, so it's just a matter of accompanying him along the way.</p>\r\nKyler\r\n\n<p>An electronic company worker who frequents Sachiel's cafe.

Some of the mini games are helping Luca through an attack--visualized by a <strong>moving background.</strong></li><li>Some <strong>flashing screens</strong>\u00a0 (flashing white once, fading to black screen) and <strong>shaking screen</strong> (horizontal shaking, not more than 0.5 second--the Ren'py default 'hpunch' effect, if you know Ren'py)</li><li><strong>Screams </strong>(more low-pitched than not)<strong>\u00a0</strong>and<strong> gunshot sound effect.</strong></li><li>Visual representation of <strong>red sky and some war planes dropping bombs.</strong>\u00a0(There are<strong> NO</strong> visual of gore/blood/injury/war scene.) Only this one picture below:</li></ul>\n\n<p>Disclaimer:</p>\n<ul><li>I<strong> do not </strong>have PTSD. However, I learned about it in college. The representation of 'post-traumatic stress behaviors' here might not reflect all patients with similar conditions.</li><li>I <strong>do\u00a0 </strong>have depression &amp; anxiety. The anxiety attack mini game was modeled after my own. It still might not reflect all patients with similar conditions.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Please proceed at your own risk. Feel free to email me\u00a0if you have any questions.</strong></p>\r\n&gt;&gt;Final notes&lt;&lt;\r\n<p>This project was started on 2014, far before I\u00a0understood depression/anxiety/PTSD etc. At that time, I\u00a0was under depression/anxiety, myself, without realizing. Like I said, the idea to turn anxiety attack into mini game was after my own. Maybe it was how younger me tried to ask for help. Then college problems arise and I\u00a0left it until\u00a0 January 2018.</p>\n<p>The time I\u00a0started, I was so pumped. As time goes by, even if I'm making progress, doubts start to appear--why do I bother? What am I aiming for...? It's a classic thought with artist, especially art as a side/hobby (not as a job), especially in visual art, and even more so in people who have depression/anxiety like me.</p>\n<p>If this game can somehow entertain even just one audience, I think I'll be a little happier. Or even if not, at the very least, I finished it, I\u00a0put it out.</p>\n<p><strong>I just want to say, to whomever reading this far, if you are struggling, you've done well. Don't hurt others but more so don't hurt yourself. If you keep on trying you will end up somewhere better than if you don't, so keep trying!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/0524ef79b4bb2661386e5ab560dcefea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Felis Selita"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
