Do you like doing completely normal things? Do you like the night? Then you'll (maybe) love Midnight Stroll!

There's also, like, minigames and stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you like squiggly monochrome!</p>\n\n\n<p>(Bug reports and feedback are appreciated!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T07:09:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d69/d698d199214e7eb941eba734aaa82127.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cosmicallity"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
