The game has a  fixed turn order, always changing between teams and with a turn  consisting of a move and attack phase, both skippable.\r\n    </p>\n<p>The relevance to the theme is that the prey are together protecting themselves against predators.\r\n</p>\n<p>Made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2 (https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-8) (https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-8/rate/1680783)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The rotate camera buttons are (maybe?) not working. Use A and D instead. Also there are some bugs with the in game replay button, refresh the browser instead. The attack and move stages are optional, press the \"Don't move/attack\" button in the bottom left corner if you want to skip the stage.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0\r\n    </p>\n<p>Programmer: Eduardo G.
