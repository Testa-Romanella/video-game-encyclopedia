In this game you will be free to design and shape a terrain to your liking and populate it with buildings, streets, props, foliage and people. You have full artistic freedom to create and express yourself in any way you like. The first time you play the game, it will be on a timer (15 minutes). After finishing one game session and restarting, no timer restrictions will be present anymore. <br/></p>\n<p>I have developed this game in the context of a user study that investigates in-game player behavior.
