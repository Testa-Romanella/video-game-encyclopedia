Take command as Captain and set sail with your crew as you manage the ship. Holding and releasing 'Mouse1', whatever that be, will allow you to grab yer crew and command them to a set job. Be sure to manage your jobs accordingly, however. The mast needs to be held, the deck needs to be swabbed, and everyone needs to eat, so ye better get to fishin'! Use that new fangled 'Mouse2' to command a crewmate to the nearest job, and get to sailin'!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>W: Up<br/>A: Left<br/>S: Down<br/>D: Right<br/>Mouse1: Gather Crew<br/>Mouse2: Command crewmate to do nearest job<br/>Tab: View Captain's Log</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/309/3094a9001ec1819dd1c5f81d44160348.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shamse"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
