This game won't be getting any updates or bug-fixes because it's written with very shitty code in Game Maker. I wrote this before I knew how to properly make games, but I polished the hell out of the final product. I tried to combine my favorite aspects of the DKC series into a single fangame.\r\nIf you get stuck or frustrated, leave a comment and I'll try to help you out. Looking back, the difficulty is a bit much from what I would make nowadays, but it's not so hard that's it's impossible.\r\nEnjoy :D \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/075/075500a681c13776536636e72513a156.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pebbl3s"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
