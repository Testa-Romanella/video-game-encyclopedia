Beyond that, it's hard to classify. There are no explicit teams, and no in-game incentive to help other players, but it's nearly impossible to win on your own.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Each player starts in the middle of the board, and the goal is to battle your way outwards until you defeat a boss. As you flip over tiles, you will discover monsters, weapons, items and traps, which may strengthen or weaken your character.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whenever a monster is discovered, nearby players have the option to help or hurt you. You can team up with another player to carve a swathe straight to a boss, or hang around the other team to Inhibit their progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once a boss has been defeated, the game is over, and you'll know who the losers are!</p>\n\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Contributors:</p>\n<p>Francis Dooling - Design</p>\n<p>Chris Hall - Design</p>\n<p>Linda He - Design, Art\u00a0</p>\n<p>John Russell - Design, Stats balancing, Code, network stuff</p>\n\n<p>The original form of this project was a boardgame I made with some friends :)</p>\n<p>I came up with the original design, and we playtested it together until it looked completely different.
