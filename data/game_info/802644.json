Our math skills are getting worse and worse and the next generation is only going to go more downhill from here if we don't do something. But making exercises from a math book every day to keep practicing that doesn't sound very appealing...</p>\n<p>That's where <strong>u + me = love</strong> comes in! It's the perfect game for junior high school students to playfully practice their basic math skills. In the game, the students help Mathew to win over his crush. By solving puzzles and figuring out information from the given information, they can help him. By using a recognizable situation, they can easily relate to the story. Instead of using the boring unrelatable situations they're used to from school exercises.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This way, they're subtly practicing their math reading skills and they'll playfully improve their math skills!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T10:08:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d9/6d95115e64abad947a51e62913189f2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TaytoPotatoe"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
