In this game, you play as a black pawn who's goal is set on saving the king. You will find upgrades that allows you to promote to other pieces on blue save points, different types of areas with different types of enemies, metroidvania and chess styled puzzles, and just a lot of charm!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T06:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c30/c304534e7809c271ac7ad4d4da212523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Craftyman6"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
