It is based on a codebase from a turn-based stealth game by krisekrise and Jonas Eschner. Unfortunately, we did not find time to balance the game mechanics, but it is still an interesting gameplay idea and we already improved on it in the postjam version. So check that out, if you are not here for the original 7drl experience!<br/></p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n<strong> Controls </strong>\n\n<p>- Use WASD to move<br/>- Use Q and E to rotate the ring fields<br/>- Drag and drop rings to equip them<br/>- Hover over rings to preview their abilities<br/>- F11 for fullscreen</p> Tutorial<strong>\n</strong>\n<br/>\n<p>Each turn a finger on your hand will activate. Equip rings to create attack patterns for that finger. Rings can have different patterns, strengths and element types and the effects of each ring on a finger are combined together to create your attack for that turn. You can see which tiles your attack will effect next turn by the square tile borders displayed.<br/>Reach the BOYFRIEND HEAVEN teleport (it glows pink) in each level and ascend.<br/></p>\n<p>The element types are: COLD, HOT, SOFT and SPIKY<br/></p>\n\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>\n</strong> Further Credits \r\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Jonas Eschner for making the ring models!\r\n</p><p>- \"The Fallen Angels by Salvatore Albano\" (https://skfb.ly/DXHH) by alban is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</p>\n<p>- Original artwork by Salvatore Albano, 1893, Brooklyn Museum</p>\n<p>- Great Fairy model ripped by Zerox.</p>\n<p>- \"Autopia\" font: Copyright (C) 2014 - Antoine Gelgon (Luuse) - http://luuse.io/</p>\n<p>- Autopia font family is under SIL Open Font License (OFL)</p>\n<p>- Particle Images by Kenney (https://kenney.nl/)</p>\n<p>- AI Facesets generated by DALL-E 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb31809f0040389c5582ae83946d906.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Spiders", "krisekrise"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
