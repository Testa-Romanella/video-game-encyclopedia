Its rules are simple, but result in rich dynamics.\r\n </p>\n\n<p>To progress towards the goal, at each move the player select a tile  of a \u201cdomain\u201d (group of tiles of same value). This tile increases value  and the rest of the domain disappears, making room for new random tiles  from the top.\r\n </p>\n<p>An important part of how the player can influence the game is that  the player chooses which tile of the domain they play, which decides  where the new tile appears and where disappearing tiles cause other  tiles to fall, creating new opportunities for aligned tiles of the same  value -&gt; new groups.\r\n </p>\n<p>This makes possible to \u201cclear out\u201d obstructing tiles in various ways.  Watch out not to \u201cbreak\u201d interesting domains by removing tiles under  some parts.\r\n </p>\n<p>First moves are really easy and provide a quick intuitive  understanding, yet difficult gradually increases, maintaining a nice  level of challenge and thinking all along.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd0/cd0919adbcb759e48415a928206fb3d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cpcitor"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
