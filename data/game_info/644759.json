{"id": 644759, "slug": "valor-2", "name": "Valor", "name_original": "Valor", "description": "Embark on a epic journey through a range of different environments and arenas. Upgrade, personalize and finetune your characters, overcome different challenges and bossfights to prove the single most important thing: your worth as a gladiator.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Valor features different arenas, each with their own set of challenges. A change of scene is not just that, but also brings along new enemies and environment-specific obstacles and strategies. Every environment ends in an epic bossfight (classic!) where you'll have to prove your worth and understanding of the game's mechanics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As your gladiators level up, you'll be able to dig into their upgrade trees to make the most of their abilities. You'll also unlock various runes with special effects that can be equipped by any of your gladiators. Are you the master of innovation with all the different combinations of runes?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Let's be honest. Nobody likes to pay for skins. That's why, in Valor, all skins are earned through achievements. Battling in style actually means something.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If easy games aren't your thing, you'll enjoy this one. Increase the difficulty of your challenges to earn extra rewards and cosmetics. I'll be honest, I don't think you can beat all levels on the Gladiator Difficulty, but feel free to prove me wrong.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T02:46:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f035f60ef2e650a84ece12b6afd53847.jpg", "website": "https://www.instagram.com/openmidinteractive/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Open Mid Interactive", "Sillybilly2454"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Open Mid Interactive", "Sillybilly2454"], "esrb_rating": null}
