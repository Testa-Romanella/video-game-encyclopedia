Yes I love IDLE-GAMES I only play IDLE games recently... I dont have much time to play hardcore games due to work.<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Why did you make this game?<br/>-For fun and I am not charging anyone. game is 100% free to play.<br/>\n</li><li>You have so many games!! Are you rich?? Are you a sucsessfull developer?<br/>- I am a hobbyst, and no I am not turning out a profit. I work for love and all of my games<br/>are free. Norega is my only game with paid DLC in case you like the idea of supporting me in exchange of extra content?<br/>\n</li><li>I saw some negative reviews on your past games saying you are an ASSET -FLLIPER.....<br/>- I clearly am not an asset flipper I did indeed draw the art of all of my games. I feel very honored by you thinking<br/>I did an asset flip. I thought I was very bad at art myself. (I am using premade graphics on this game tough).<br/>Is that considered an asset flip? \"Asset flip == premade game without any logic that bumped on steam in exchange of money.\"<br/>- My game is free so there is no chances this can be an asset flip.... I may in the future charge for some DLC so people whom supports me<br/>can keep supporting me and my games.<br/>\n</li><li>Did you draw theese graphics?<br/>- In thiss game?? NO! only in this game I didnt!<br/>\n</li><li>Is it true that your game has viruses ??<br/>- I thought it was very visible by anyone that steam wouldnt allow such a thing . Yes they do test the game before!<br/>\n</li><li>Are you saying these reviews are all false claims??<br/>- Some are some are not!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Smalles is a SMALL GAME! =D</strong><br/><br/>Smalles is a game where you will send your champion into the Dungeon to collect gold and also raise in strenght.<br/>You will acquire precious Talent Points that can be used to upgrade your character.
