And you have to get a hole in one to pass.</p><ul><li>35 levels of hole in one mini golf. You have unlimited putts, but must score a hole in one to continue.</li><li>Well, you need to finish 3 out of 5 levels to unlock the next 5. I hate how getting stuck on one level blocks your progress in other games.</li><li>Two goals for each level: fastest and slowest putts. Pretend like you were going for slowest if you get lucky on one. I won't judge.</li><li>Instant retry. You'll get in this zen like rhythm of putt, watch, adjust, re-putt. Or you'll punch the screen.</li><li>Gold, silver and bronze medals for each level for you to achieve.</li><li>5 users on the one computer.</li><li>Completely non-violent and not even any swearing either. Family friendly.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48c046445a8d4bccbc7621e7f8750f56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PurpleDogGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
