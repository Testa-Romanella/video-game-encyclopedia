Neighbors are said to have heard screams and violence. However, there are no houses nearby. Just a huge and seemingly abandoned old mansion. Still, something is going on inside, so he goes in, alone with no means of external communication and unexplainable and psycho-traumatic events. Here he finds out a lot about a Cooper Morris who is apparently behind everything and seems mentally ill in some ways.</strong>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Nico Neukirchen and Cedric Peltzer are two young game developers from Germany. They run the company CNE Studios, which stands for Cedric and Nico Entertainment Studios. There is a main YouTube channel for all of CNE Studios and side channels that are not yet public. CN Entertainment is responsible for game development. These games are developed and made by the two CEOs themselves. The games are programmed by CN Entertainment and the music, sounds, storylines and ideas are all self-made and copyrighted.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your CNE Studios\u00a0Team\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Silent Sinister Pre Alpha is for getting the public's first impressions of our horror game, and for getting criticism and improvements to the game. The Pre Alpha offers the first 10 minutes of the game and is far from the final version. On the YouTube channel and on this page you will find the latest information and steps in the development of the game and new content will be uploaded.\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>It's important to keep in mind that this game is just a prototype, so the graphics, sound and map design are not final. Of course, we still look forward to any criticism and hope for your help in further development.</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Your CNE\u00a0team</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T10:33:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/865/8651d0222d3340428526cd1872f3f461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["CNE Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
