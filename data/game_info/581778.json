Try to build the most prestigious home you can and survive! Collect new parts for your home by driving around and picking them up to attach them to your home. You gain fuel by destroying trees. You use more fuel when having more tracks, but that helps you keep your house stable. You will lose if you run out of fuel, become too unstable and fall over or flood your house under water. Try to get as many points as possible!\" - Information Text</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:<br/>Programmers:</p>\n<ul><li>GavstarB</li><li>Scorpio</li><li>Bubalubs</li><li>Luu</li><li>McCreery</li></ul>\n<p>Art/Models/Sounds:</p>\n<ul><li>McCreery</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db7/db73bae5ce02d5b2023912d2819d4fb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam McCreery"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
