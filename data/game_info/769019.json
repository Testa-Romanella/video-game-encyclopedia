{"id": 769019, "slug": "letter-grid", "name": "Letter-grid", "name_original": "Letter-grid", "description": "<p>Letter-Grid is the perfect puzzle game for those who love matching letters and grid puzzles.</p>\n<p>You are given a word as an objective and a grid. Letters from the objective word will randomly appear on the grid. You must mix them to form the objective word to gain points. This will also give you a \"word bag\"; which you can mix with another word bag to gain extra points. <br/>Aim to get the higher score from all your friends!</p>\n<p>Playing instruction: <br/>In the menu, you can use your keyboard (with the moving keys or WASD) to move and enter to select an option. Using the mouse also works. In gameplay use your keyboard moving keys or WASD to move the letters in the grid. <br/>Note: The game also works on mobiles; just sweep in the direction you want to move! However, the game is not optimized for mobile and may not work perfectly on that platform.</p>\n<p>Modes:</p>\n<p>In daily game mode, you will get a word that depends on the day. That means every other person playing on that day will get the same word, so you can compare your scores! (Ps: copying the score directly to the clipboard is not supported on all browsers).</p>\n<p>In random word game, you get a random word from the list of possible words. You can use this mode to practice.</p>\n<p>In hard mode, every time you complete a word the objective word gets changed. That makes the old letters useless and the game much harder!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T10:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37e/37e2aad4639f835ff88a8465926be468.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Naix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
