DOWNLOAD THE ROM BELOW AND PLAY IT IN A LOCAL EMULATOR FOR BEST RESULTS.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A demake of Crypt of the Necrodancer for the Gameboy Color. Very limited in scope, with lots of things unimplemented due to time constraints (like items, shovel tiers, complex enemy types). This was just a fun project to see how far I could take this in one jam. If you like this and haven't played the original game, please do!</p>\n<p>Source code available here:\u00a0https://github.com/ekimekim/gb_necrodancer</p><p>Note: This game was originally developed for the GBJam 6. One of its rules was that you can't have more than 4 colors on screen at once. This technically breaks that rule, but given that it literally runs on a real life gameboy, I'm choosing to ignore it.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Artist - sleepyparadox (https://sleepyparadox.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Music - Adapted by EpicSuccess from piano arrangement by Xeoran (https://musescore.com/xeoran/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-disco-descent-1-1).
