While historical will try to stay true to the antiquity, fictional will push game mechanics to the limit in unique scenarios.<br/><br/><br/>The fans of constructing a huge city with no goals or limitations will feel at home. You can choose on which maps you can play and adjust settings.<br/><br/><br/>When you get tired of what the base of the game has to offer, you can make your own custom maps or browse community created ones.<br/><br/><br/>At the moment of writing, players can change graphical files, sounds and music. It is also possible to add custom buildings, units and change behaviour of many objects, as they are all exposed through easily accessible ini files.<br/><br/><br/>Many gameplay elements can be adjusted in settings of the game. While it was designed to be played in a specific way, you can choose to overwrite some of those settings, for example selecting buildings that require workforce to use global workers pool, instead of having to look for people nearby.<br/><br/>You can let walkers choose their own paths, use roadblocks to limit them, or set custom paths by hand. No need to stick to specific city layouts, you can create any you like.<br/><br/><br/>It is important for me to engage with the community and listen to their opinions. I don't want to create a game that only I will enjoy playing. If you have any suggestions or you would like to contribute to the development of the game in any way, then you can create a post on Steam forums or write on Discord. I will respond as soon as I can.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T11:11:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc0afbed80eed169fd65a497364e9f20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aleksander Ciesielski"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aleksander Ciesielski"], "esrb_rating": null}
