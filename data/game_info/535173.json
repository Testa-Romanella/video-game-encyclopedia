It's more likely than you think.</p>\n\n<p>It all started with the death of the queen. As all the knights mourned their loss, calamity struck for the queen was not dead. She rose from her grave as a vampire and began a new reign of terror.</p>\n<p>The knights were reluctant to raise their weapon against the queen, but it had to be done. Knight after knight entered her castle, but were only met with demise. Only one weapon could be used against her: the ethereal wand. The knights searched and searched for the weapon, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>When hope was all but lost, the wand presented itself to one special knight. The knight knew what he had to do. It was his duty, nay, his destiny to confront the queen himself and end her reign for good.</p>\n\n<p>Will the knight succeed in his quest for justice? Or will he meet the same fate as all the knights before him, cursed to walk the halls of the castle as reanimated ghouls and monsters?</p><p>Music by Aljoscha Guenther:\u00a0https://remancer.bandcamp.com/album/tale-of-the-vampire-queen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T06:31:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f7/1f762cd844428ca6180476abac1713d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nomppie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
