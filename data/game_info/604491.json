You play as a dog who's trapped in a forgotten pet game and wants to escape to see their owner again. This is just a beta version of the game. Since it was just made for a class and that class has ended there's no guarantee\u00a0a full version will ever be made, and may just stay as a beta. However if there's interest we'll think about getting together in our free time to finish it!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions/Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Your goal is to figure out the puzzles to be able to escape the room.</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li><em>WASD - Move around</em>\n</li><li><em>Space - Jump</em>\n</li><li><em>E - Pick up object</em></li><li><em>Q - Drop object</em></li><li><em>LMB - Use leash</em></li><li><em>R - Talk</em></li><li><em>Tab - Pause Menu/Controls List</em></li></ul>\n\n<p><em><strong>(SPOILERS)</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>How to Beat the Level:</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Pick up the plank, and drop it over the gap so you can get across. Then you have to push the box towards the wall that has a little ball inside of a whole. Pick-up the ball and throw it at the two shelves. From there climb over the shelves, jump up onto the chair and grab the leash. From the chair shoot the leash at the shelf with a bone on it. Once you have the bone drop it on front of the AI that's towards the direction of the door. From there you want to grab the ball on the dresser, jump on the couch, open the drawers, climb onto the drawers, throw the ball at the shelf, climb onto the shelf to get a new bone and drop that in front of the enemy at the door. Then use the leash to open the door and walk through the beat the level.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T05:53:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/476/476bfcf8092644a2bed26c1d67cb191b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Minoqi"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
