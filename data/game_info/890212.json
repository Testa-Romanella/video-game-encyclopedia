They move along on a conveyor belt through the Christmas Factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each elf on its own is too weak to carry the gift, so two adjacent ones need to hold it up together. If the gift gets stuck on something however or an elf holding it needs to dodge an obstacle, the gift is lost!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to avoid that from happening, move the gift around between the elfs.</p>\n<p>But be careful! The factory gets more complicated and filled up with obstacles as time goes on and the conveyor belts ramp up at a steady speed. How long can you keep the gift from dropping?</p>\n\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>W,A,S,D \u2192 rotate the selected elf</p>\n<p>Space \u2192 Swap selected elf</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All assets, except for the audio\u00a0were created by us (Robin @Chiibi and Sven @theLORDofMUESLI)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T06:01:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c400b5c13dd8b6932c608bb84b3fbf5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["theLORDofMUESLI", "Chiibi"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
