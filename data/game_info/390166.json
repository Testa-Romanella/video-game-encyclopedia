It's a complicated ecosystem, where the various species need to coexist together. The goal of the puzzle is to help the beaver population to\u00a0cut down all the trees in the area. You play as various species though and you need to think how to chain your moves, based on the transition order of the species, so you don't block your own path.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T03:26:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/720/7204cff72beeaa6ef602a0f488c8f6a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["teo_sk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
