He is the son of chimpanzee Ai, and has been a participant since infancy in the Ai Project, an ongoing research effort aimed at understanding chimpanzee cognition. As part of the Ai Project, Ayumu participated in a series of short-term memory tasks, such as to remember the sequential order of numbers displaying on a touch-sensitive computer screen. His performance in the tasks was superior to that of comparably trained university students, leading to a possible conclusion that young chimpanzees have better working memory than adult humans.</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayumu_(chimpanzee)</p>\n<p>Inspiration and art\u00a0by Yesim Taskin</p>\n<p>The project goal is to make a fun version of this game for people to enjoy training in order to get better than Ayumu. After replicating the original program I want to extend it so that the number of digits extend to player's capabilities.</p>\n<p>How many digits\u00a0are you about to get up to?</p>\n<p>Open Source MIT License credit would be appreciated :)</p>\n<p>https://github.com/benfknzen/Ayumu-Memory-Game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T03:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b0/8b05a3aa44b19188a553c6956d41f032.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["theorycraft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
