That\u2019s the mood which\u00a0Devotionalia\u00a0is after, and it skewers it like a moth on a specimen-board.\" </em><br/>\u2014 <strong>Sam Kabo Ashwell</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>\"In a way, this game reminds me of the works of Chandler Groover and Phantom Williams. It has a similar rich aesthetic. A surreal, haunting feel. A sense that there\u2019s more hidden below the surface. [...] The interface matches the ambition of the prose. The music is atmospheric and appropriate. The aesthetics of the design are completely aligned to the game experience.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s something a little bit special, this.\" <br/></em>\u2014 <strong>McT's Interactive Fiction Reviews</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Together with the glowing hypertext links and the echoing chants of the background music, the whole package is a hauntingly beautiful piece [...] As a breakfast, I think it's rice congee with a firm, white fish, topped with flakes of crispy fried onions and fresh chives. It has an ascetic look, but threads of ginger and sesame oil boiled in with the rice make it surprisingly flavourful. And then, piping hot green tea.\"</em> <br/>\u2014 Christopher Huang, <strong>The Breakfast Review</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"The pensive mood of the game supports its plot. The author handles the alien details of the world well, showing rather than telling and focusing on the story rather than belaboring the setting details. It\u2019s a much more original setting and plot than most games have, and the author provides just enough details to make it comprehensible but still mysterious, befitting the priest\u2019s uncertainty about his gods.\"</em> <br/>\u2014 <strong>IFComprehensive</strong><br/></p>\n<p>IFDB</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/177/177429de99134508a980d755340ae335.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grim \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Curio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
