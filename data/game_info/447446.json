This build follows the first three chapters of our game and focuses on the fundamental element of our game: the story.<br/><br/><strong>Important notes to maximise your play-testing experience:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- We are missing audio right after you have been in the shop as Jazz's character, where you are then switched straight to Azul's character. For those who get confused by this,\u00a0 the objective is for Azul's character to open the journal and make their way to the next stop on the plan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- When it permanently fades to black, this means the game is over.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>W</strong>\u00a0- walk forward</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>\u00a0- walk left</p>\n<p><strong>S</strong>\u00a0- walk backward</p>\n<p><strong>D\u00a0</strong>- walk right</p>\n<p><strong>Left click</strong>\u00a0- interact</p>\n<p><strong>(<em>Windows</em>) = Alt + Tab / (<em>Mac</em>) = Command + Tab</strong>\u00a0- to exit (apologies about this, exit button hasn't been added yet. press alt and tab at the same time for windows/command and tab at the same time\u00a0 for mac\u00a0 and exit the game from your taskbar by right clicking on the Jazz and Azul icon.)\r\n<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>\n<p>We are working incredibly hard to get the next build out, so any feedback on how we can improve the experience for you guys for our next build will be much appreciated.</p>\n<p>We are so excited to be releasing this!
