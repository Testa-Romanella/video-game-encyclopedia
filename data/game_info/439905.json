Having potion polarity identified for you makes the early floors a lot more fun and more interesting (in my estimation) because you still don't know what every potion does, and you end up throwing quite a lot of bad potions around even before you'd actually want to because otherwise your inventory fills up. It doesn't really make the lower levels any easier because by that point you'd have the potions identified for you anyway.</p>\n\n<p>These are the compiled versions for mac/win/linux.</p>\n\n<p>Brogue is by Brian Walker and can be found here:\u00a0https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/home</p>\n\n<p>This version includes the Community Edition changes which can be found here:\u00a0https://github.com/tmewett/BrogueCE</p>\n\n<p>The source for this version can be found here:\u00a0https://github.com/stfj/BrogueCE</p>\n\n<p>Big thanks to Liffon for the windows build and\u00a0demiurgo for the linux build, and Kevin Thompson for solving the issues with the mac build!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:15:13", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zach Gage"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
