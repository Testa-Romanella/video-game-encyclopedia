Keeping order out on the brink of civilisation is not an easy task and you will be left with nothing but your instincts to guide you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two main officers under your command are <strong>Commander Flynn</strong> and <strong>Lieutenant Ashton</strong>, their view points will be endlessly useful in weighing any decision you have to make.</p>\n<p>Among the Reproach's arsenal are also an armoured personnel transport shuttle and a squadron of light attack fighters, while these will prove useful in many situations, keep in mind that when used they may become damaged and unable to be utilised again for the remainder of the patrol. Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T08:37:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/996/99682194c56208eed6b68a0e165a841c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joshua Keene"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
