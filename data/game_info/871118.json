But this time, things are a little different.<br/></p>\n<p>Players position themselves with their controllers in hand or\u00a0on either side of the keyboard. The key is\u00a0to hit keys in time with the music beats to spawn notes. Then, notes follow the track down and 'hit' the other player. Both players must keep in time with the music and put out a steady beat if they don't want to lose! ...if you missed it, the whole idea is to<strong>\u00a0reconnect\u00a0</strong>your notes and rhythm with your opponent!\r\n</p>\n<p>Because in this game, winner takes all!!\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n<br/>\r\nProgramming - Mitch S.\r\n<br/>\r\nMusic - Josh Sohn\r\n<br/>\r\nArt - Bre S.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T13:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/7597d599c3dfaa766cc6562c26b141bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yotingo", "sohncompositions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
