They also change what they want to hear at the start of the \"Listen...\" phase.</p>\n<p>Once the \"Listen...\" phase ends, you'll have to play back the rhythm\u00a0they are dancing to with SPACE in order to change the song to what they want to hear. However, after a while the crowd will start asking for multiple songs at once, and anyone not dancing to their favorite song will start to leave the party.</p>\n<p>You can only play one song at a time! Do you want to keep as many people dancing as possible? Do you want to cater to the people near the exit to stop them from leaving? Their rhythms will also cross over each other, so you have to take care to still play the correct beat!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:33:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9e57df4963dbcc5c61b3397c98f8db7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Long Story Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
