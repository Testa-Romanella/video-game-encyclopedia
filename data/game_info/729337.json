It's time to take the fight there!<br/><br/>We found their primary military headquarters and determined their weakness. Destroy all of the Power Gems within the 20 rooms in the HQ and they should be leaving us alone for a good long time!<br/><br/>Remember that you only get 1 Raider to use and when its shield has been used up, the next hit will destroy it. Let's see how many rooms you can clear!<br/><br/><strong>Objective</strong><br/>In each room, destroy all Power Gems and then return to the teleport pad to exit.<br/><br/>For bonus points, destroy all Gems in the room. For even more bonus points, do this as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Complete all 20 rooms without letting your Raider be destroyed for ultimate glory.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T03:00:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f1/3f1858db6e40f66888783a872268cda9.jpg", "website": "https://www.mwgames.com/?page_id=3874", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Worden"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Matt Worden Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
