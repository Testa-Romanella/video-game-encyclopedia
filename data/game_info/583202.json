Kill as many as you can in as quick a succession as possible to earn as much money as you can. With this money, upgrade yourself and your boomerang, and, when you've gotten all the Single Upgrades, pick an upgrade path.</p>\n<p>The possible upgrade paths are Blade, Bludgeon, Blast, Blaze and Bloodlust. I'll let you figure out what abilities they provide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But for the time being, enjoy the game!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move around(duh)</p>\n<p>SHIFT - Sprint at the cost of Stamina</p>\n<p>Left Click - Throw boomerang</p>\n<p>Some tips:</p>\n<p>1. Sprint into an enemy to INSTANTLY kill them with a shoulder charge at the cost of some Stamina.</p>\n<p>2. Get as high a kill combo as possible - the amount of money you earn will be multiplied by it!</p>\n<p>3. Conserve your health! It increases only slightly at the end of each wave, and there are no medkits!</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed <strong>Boomerang Bloodlust</strong>, consider supporting me on Patreon:\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/mysteriousdeveloper</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>-Evil laughter by\u00a0<strong>The\u00a0Dictator</strong></p>\n<p>-Sound effects obtained from zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>-Art and programming by the\u00a0<strong>Mysterious Developer</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T21:58:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04ed4e2c27fcc332659dee84a4d064b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MysteriousDeveloper"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
