Those have the ability to split instead of getting killed. But not forever! So split them a couple of times in order to kill them.</p>\n<p>But you should be fast. Splitted blobs can eat each other to grow back to their full size! This also works across different variants of it. So yellow blobs can also eat green blobs and vice versa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But those blobs don't just appear. They are spawned from eggs (outside of the arena) and will fly to you. Eggs are immortal and while blobs are flying they've a shield.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>There are 3 types of Flying Blobs in the game!
