Inspired by a glitch in the original Quake where the devs forgot to program in a parachute that was necessary to complete a level... !!! This is also officially our first game together :)</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>What do you do when the devs fail you? You make your own way! \"Honey, Where's My Parachute?\" is a game in which you must scavenge materials to make a parachute because the devs (us) have failed to provide you with one.</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n<p>If you really liked this game and/or want to see more, consider supporting us on Patreon! It would make our week :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T21:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b36/b361e6da32fd1ea1f1c2fef83b8b086a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SushiMuffin Productions"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
