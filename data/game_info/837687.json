Use dice to complete combat encounters, open locks and trade for items. Dice can have a standard value or be a special type like bombs or keys that are used for special actions.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrows to move</li><li>Use the mouse to interface with the UI</li></ul>\n<p>Credits<br/></p><ul><li>Nicholas McDonnell</li><li>MiniFantasy Sprites -\u00a0https://krishna-palacio.itch.io/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T16:38:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f6/6f6ed7aaa97a5b769547521ae713a5e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas McDonnell"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
