The theme was \"Loop,\" and the game follows a roguelite-style game progression where you loop from the beginning after unlocking upgrades permanently, giving you more options to strategize and build around tower placement.</p>\n<p>This is my first ever game jam, and was also solo, so I definitely ran into a lot of shortcomings I didn't expect to see! Nevertheless, it was the most fun I've had building a game project and I experienced many invaluable learning moments throughout the process.</p>\n<p>I was planning on adding sound effects, but unfortunately I pushed it back too far and ended up running out of time to add them\u00a0 because of some build errors that popped up on the last day.</p>\n<p>I'm definitely going to continue working on this project, so if you like it or have some feedback or criticism please please please let me know!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:35:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/678/6788a46719ec21e4196417017c74409c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yookakim"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
