You can play in three different difficulty levels, each one with different mechanics wich make more or less the game challenging.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this demo enjoyable and fun to play.</p>\n<p>I look forward to your feedback, which I'll use to improve the game and make it more complete and can continue in this path of the Game Development I recently started and enjoyed since the first day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T07:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25d5fa2d6562fa74cc432f2032cbca28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Improvus - Game Development"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
