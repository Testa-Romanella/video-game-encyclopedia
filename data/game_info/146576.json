Game starts in a empty chamber where you (and any friends) will see the flight instructions, only not may of them are there since you're supposed to have an instructor - except the people vanished a long time ago, so you're on your own. Once started you have to go through the roof portal, find and activate the Runic temples in order to return! On your way you should stop and collect the Nothings! Each color is\u00a0worth different points to your score. Rings will give you Nothings too.\u00a0\u00a0Do be careful of the 'Tol' or evil magic infecting the Magical test bubble - you'll lose Nothings if you touch anything infected!\u00a0</p>\n<p>So short instructions:</p>\n<ol><li>Download appropriate game file</li><li>Enter the online multiplayer (or host your own multiplayer)</li><li>Read instructions in starting chamber</li><li>Fly through ceiling portal</li><li>Activate all 3 temples and fly back to the portal, collecting Nothings\u00a0</li><li>Share your score with friends!</li><li>Send us feedback! :)</li></ol>\n<p>A few idiosyncrasies (it is a game jam game done in\u00a0 like 48 yours)</p>\n<ul><li>You'll need to exit and restart game to play again</li><li>There are a few issues with the sound\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>The character (in multiplayer) we had clothing\u00a0 \"issues\", fair warning.
