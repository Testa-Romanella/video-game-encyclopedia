{"id": 208180, "slug": "desert-marauder", "name": "Desert Marauder", "name_original": "Desert Marauder", "description": "<p>Desert Marauder is a simple turn-based, strategy roguelike game where you need to cross a desert filled with monsters.</p>\n<p>This project is more a proof of concept, prototype, rather than a full game; more guns, monsters and other things are expected in a future more worked version. It has the very basics mechanics that would compose it though, and we expect your feedback in case you stumbled with our project!<br/></p>\n<p>Here some help to play:</p>\n<p>Movement:</p>\n<p>- Use the arrows on the num-pad and the numbers 7, 9, 1 and 3 to move to adjacent tiles. Remember, every move counts as a turn for everything, such as projectiles movement and monsters in the tilemap.</p>\n<p>Combat:</p>\n<p>- Hold 'C' to enter in the attack mode: this means that, while in this mode, you will not move, but shoot in the direction you intend by pressing the num-pad direction you want to shoot.</p>\n<p>To combat foes along your journey through the wasteland, you have two options: An ice cannon, and bombs. The ice cannon has infinite ammo, but the bombs are limited. To change between weapons, press 'A' or 'Z'</p>\n<p>The ice cannon can freeze your enemies, and turn them into barriers (or obstacles), and the bombs destroy them completely leaving no trace. It can destroy rocks that may block your path too. You can collect more bombs by passing through the ammo boxes spreaded in the levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Monsters will spawn from pitholes: you can destroy them by shooting a bomb on them!</p>\n<p>There's two types of monsters:</p>\n<p>- The common one, looks like a demon meatball. It can be defeated by both weapons.<br/>- The slimy, purple one is not affected by the ice cannon. You must defeat it with bombs.</p>\n<p>To advance through levels, you can enter in cave-ins with a arrow pointing down; the cave-ins with a arrow pointing up are for returning to the previous level in case you need.\u00a0There's currently only 3 levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f34ac196d1ad50a40047cdd8652376b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magenta Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
