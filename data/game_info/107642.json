Can you defeat this evil, or will the monsters - both human and inhuman - be your downfall before you can avert an alien god's apocalypse?</em></p><p>This is a roguelike game made in seven days for the 2017 Seven Day Roguelike Challenge.  You play the game in a standard roguelike fashion, using the arrow keys to move around, trying to defeat the ultimate villain.  Unlike typical roguelikes, however, the procedural generation is in the story development, rather than the geography.  Each time you play, the mystery will be different.</p><p>For a full list of controls, press \"H\" for help in the game.</p><p>Currently, there is enough content for about five or six different mystery paths.  If there is enough interest, I can add more \"ploxels\" (or \"plot elements\") to the game so that more mysteries can be generated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c38/c3891cb187671b5f8aab4b6f7a3b597b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lone Spelunker"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
