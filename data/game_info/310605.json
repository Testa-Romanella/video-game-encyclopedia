Over the course of the game you will find yourself dodging more and more obstacles spat out from the spinning void at the centre of the map. But be careful, asteroids from the corners of space will make your life hard. Use the backwards turret to shoot asteroids and the forward gun to shoot black hole debris.<br/><br/>PULSOR, although simplistic, you may find is quite addictive, once you get the hang of the rotation controls you will be chasing that next high score in no time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wish list the steam page here !\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1066670/PULSOR/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T06:30:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/625bc7b073e0369be3279c97899caff8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["robotrage"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
