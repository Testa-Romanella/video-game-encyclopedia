It is fully functional but could do with some polish.</em></p><p><strong><strong>Reception</strong></strong></p><p><em>\"Wow, what a game! We had 4 people play and it was a ton of fun goofing around making a show. Adhered to theme perfectly and the stories everyone made were great. Tons of fun, everything was there, super high scores on this one!\"</em><br/></p><p><em>\"This game is great! The networking is really impressive, and the idea is super fun and spot on with the theme. Some of the visuals could be improved, there's some balancing to be done, etc - but that's all very small compared to what has been done right in this. In fact the things I would say were \"bad\" are actually just ideas I have for being able to play the game with different modes, or for longer, and so on. Awesome game\"</em><br/></p><p><em>\"It could use a lot of polishing up but otherwise it's a great concept. It's really god damn cool. Good job man [...] I'm very impressed that you managed to make a game with truly innovative gameplay that is simultaneously approachable!\"</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a81/a8149a959d9f23ee64dbd1324d50f793.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Citizen Of M\u00eal\u00e9e"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
