{"id": 309757, "slug": "radio-general", "name": "Radio General", "name_original": "Radio General", "description": "<p>The attack came without warning in the dead of night. Machine guns can be heard chattering in the distance. Rushing into the command tent, you find several hurriedly assembled reports on your desk. Estimated enemy strength, composition and positions... all unknown. Real useful. The report on your available units is little better; Able and Baker companies should have arrived at La Gleize by now, but nobody&#39;s been able to raise them. Will need to send out a patrol to look for them and give them new radios. That&#39;s enough paperwork though - it&#39;s time to get to work. Clearing off your desk reveals a map of the area and some unit figurines. You grab the radio microphone, adjust a few dials, and say into the receiver:<br />\n&quot;Charlie Company, Report Status.&quot;<br />\nIt&#39;s time to take command of the situation.<br />\nRadio General is a real-time strategy game where you can&#39;t see your units. Instead you interact with them over the radio, and must ask them what&#39;s happening. Units report to you verbally with full voice-acting. Unfortunately for you, war is confusing. Your units won&#39;t always know what&#39;s going on, and you must make tough decisions based on these incomplete (and often confused) reports. All of this is done from a detailed command tent, as it would have been during WW2.<br />\nIf you\u2019re after an extra layer of immersion, try commanding your troops with your voice! Using speech recognition and your microphone, you can choose to speak out loud to direct your units. By combining speech recognition with full voice-acting, you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re a general on the horn with your troops.<br />\nBehind the scenes, ammunition, morale, camouflage, sight and stamina are all being modelled. Elevation and terrain type will heavily influence battles. A smaller force will be more successful in launching ambushes in a forest than a larger force. Being on a road drastically improves movement speed, however affords little cover and camouflage. Being on a hill will drastically increase your spotting distance, whilst also increasing your range and damage. Study the map carefully, and identify how best to use your units.<br />\nChoose carefully which companies you deploy on each mission - each company has unique strengths and weakness. Learn the quirks and personalities of each company commanders, as different personalities will affect how they react to certain situations. Hot-headed commanders may rush into battle undirected, and timid officers may refuse to engage larger forces.<br />\nCompanies will also have to rest and replenish their numbers after tough missions, making it important to rotate which companies to deploy, and which will stay in reserve. Companies will also gain veterancy and earn perks, but be careful - take too many losses in a mission, and your veteran company may be permanently destroyed.<br />\nPlay the singleplayer campaign from the under-represented perspective of the 1st Canadian Army. Take part in the disastrous Dieppe Raid, crack the Hitler and Gothic Lines in Italy, land in Normandy and liberate the Lowland Countries.<br />\nUnlike other strategy games, it&#39;s OK to lose; the campaign continues after a loss. It will be a tough balancing act appeasing high command&#39;s unrealistic expectations whilst keeping your men alive. Additionally, your objectives may not be the same as your enemies - reading your intel reports may give you a clue as to what objectives the enemy values.<br />\nRecreate history&#39;s most famous battles of the war using an easy to use map editor. Share your creations using Steam workshop. Create challenging scenarios for others to try to beat!<br />\nBattle against players around the globe, or ally with them against the AI! Enjoy slower-paced tactical matches without needing insane micromanagement skills typical of most RTS games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T14:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04f82295d5407b7cc2d1bb09028c31f7.jpg", "website": "http://www.foolish-mortals.net/radiogeneral", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 27, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Foolish Mortals"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Foolish Mortals"], "esrb_rating": null}
