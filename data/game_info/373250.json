Each room is designed by hand, but various randomization can occur for enemy behavior and weapon pickups. This project was made for the PotluckJam in 7 days. Everything created by Tyler M Richardson, except the music, created by Ozzed.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD keys to move, left mouse button to shoot.</p>\n<p>Tips: You only need to pass through 18 rooms to reach the end boss, so run and gun is your best strategy!</p>\n<p>Bugs: Some enemies fail to find a path to you, making them easy to deal with. Fullscreen has a bug with the room transition script, so it may look odd when transitioning between rooms in fullscreen mode.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T07:22:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/506/506bcb6d06162d9bd0543a319dc478c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DEATH"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
