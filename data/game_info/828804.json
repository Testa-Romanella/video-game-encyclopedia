Scratch Cat Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property, person, or intense psychological trauma. Especially after last time.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is a parody of Scott Cawthon's Five Nights at Freddy's 2. Though there is no grotesque imagery or backstory, there are still jumpscares if you happen to lose. If you are sensitive to flashing images and loud sounds, please refrain from playing this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Fullscreen is greatly recommended!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>=HOW TO PROGRESS=</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Instead of making progress by just beating nights like in FNaF, in this game you make progress by earning stars. There are four stars to earn in this game:\r\n</p>\n<p>1) Beat Night 3. (All nights after Night 3 are obsolete)\r\n</p>\n<p>2) Complete Nightmare Mode with no cheats active.\r\n</p>\n<p>3) Get the secret ending, FNAF 3 style. This star\r\n</p>\n<p>counts as beating the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>4) Complete 10/20 mode with no cheats active and 3\r\n</p>\n<p>stars already collected.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>=HOW TO SAVE/LOAD YOUR PROGRESS=</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1) Press the Save Game button in the Options menu to\r\n</p>\n<p>show your save code.\r\n</p>\n<p>2) Copy the save code or write it down somewhere.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can now safely exit the game. (Your high scores\r\n</p>\n<p>in Survival Mode will not be saved.)\r\n</p>\n<p>3) To load your save, press the Load Game button in\r\n</p>\n<p>the Options menu and enter your save code.\r\n</p>\n<p>(WARNING: Entering anything other than a save code may reset your progress!)\r\n</p>\n<p>Hold R for about 3 seconds to perform a hard reset. This will revert the game back to its original state before you started playing. (For mobile users, just reload the page.)\r\n</p>\n<p>Please do not snoop inside for secrets. It's more fun to discover everything for yourself. Spoiler comments and comments of save codes will be deleted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T05:46:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/985/985c5834c3eb9403269ee32972c166c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adiar Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
