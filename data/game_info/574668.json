The main aim of the game is to escape potty. I got the inspiration for the game from my nephew who always tries to escape potty and gives silly reasons not to do it :D.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as \"Mr. Triangle\", the expert in escaping potty :D Each time you escape a potty you get 10 points. So enjoy escaping potty :P</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The controls are super simple. Its just one key press ie. SPACE bar or one click ie. the LEFT mouse button that makes \"Mr. Triangle\" jump. Double tap to jump higher and tap again to slide down faster. You need to play for some time to get a hang of it. Touch for Mobile is also supported.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>\n<p>Cyber Jam 1#: Respecting the theme, the mechanics of jump is unexpected. We have a 3 tap jump mechanics which makes the game more playable and more fun.</p><p>Trijam #111: Respecting the theme, the players head is designed in form of a triangle and hence the name \"Mr. Triangle\".<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Concept, Design &amp; Programming<ul><li>Anagh's World - using Godot 3.2.3</li></ul></li><li>Graphics<ul><li>Kenney (www.kenney.nl) &amp; Anagh's World</li></ul></li><li>Music<ul><li>Kenney (www.kenney.nl), CodeManu @ opengameart.org &amp; Anagh's World</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Submission</strong></p><p>This game is submitted for\u00a0Cyber Jam 1# and Trijam #111: The 3 hour game jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T10:10:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfd/cfde65f112874e4b970c5123ef46898a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anagh's World"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
