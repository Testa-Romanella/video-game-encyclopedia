Yet, here is the thing: he is longing to go back to singing more operatic songs, considering he is a classical-trained countertenor. What prevents him from stopping his career, you may ask? Seiji, his scene partner, with whom he is deeply in love (although he won\u2019t admit it): he doesn\u2019t want to abandon him. With Valentine\u2019s Day approaching, will Gabriel be able to confess all his feelings to him? And what will happen after Valentine\u2019s Day?<br/>To discover it, play this heartfelt and absolutely not plot-twisty game!</p>\n<p><em>Characters</em></p>\n<p>And here is our demo dreamcast!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Okay, but what is concretely there in this game?</em></p>\n<p>Fine, fine, next time, I won\u2019t bother doing a summary! So what you can expect from the game, at its demo state, is:</p>\n<p>\u2014 around <strong>1h30 of content</strong> (more if you\u2019re a slow-reader!)<br/>\u2014 the possibility to <strong>seduce Seiji</strong> (but you might seduce the other guys and more after the demo!)<br/>\u2014 absolutely not irritating but instead deeply endearing characters; especially, <strong>the most kawaii character</strong> you\u2019ve ever met<br/>\u2014 hazardous jokes attempt<br/>\u2014 even more hazardous art attempt<br/>\u2014 the <strong>most well-written</strong> and <strong>passionate</strong> yet not totally NSFW erotic scenes you\u2019ve ever read (maybe I\u2019m lying, maybe not... You\u2019ll have to find the truth yourself...)</p>\n<p><em>And... who are you?</em></p>\n<p>Oh, you know, a nobody, just someone enjoying writing stories that break my soul and hopefully yours. But if you\u2019re really into indie BL visual novels, maybe you know La Vie en Rose, from the very great <em>Abyss Team</em>. I was lead writer on it! You might also know me from my Professor Layton fanfiction from 2010 but hopefully not.</p>\n<p><em>Credits</em></p>\n<p><strong>Writing </strong>\u2014 A proud Yacine Aggoune!<br/><strong>Art, GUI</strong> \u2014 ... erm... who knows?
