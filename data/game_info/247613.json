Using physical properties of the actual aircraft, the simulation flies just like the real thing. You control the aircraft's flight stick by rotating and tilting your device.<br/><br/>Interactive control overlays make it easy to use the extensive cockpit systems. It not only allows for input, but also provides feedback for aircraft systems such as radar mode or landing gear. You can actually hide the cockpit entirely and fly using just the control overlays.<br/><br/>Acquire a target on the realistically simulated AN/APG-65 radar. Then launch an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile and watch it track its target using physics-based flight dynamics.<br/><br/>Because the game captures performance differences between aircraft, aerial combat is highly realistic. So when you tangle with an enemy MiG-27, real-world tactics can save your day.<br/><br/>Enemy pilots are skilled adversaries, proficient in dogfighting as well as ground attack. You may find yourself in a turning battle with a MiG-21 while simultaneously evading a SAM missile. If you can survive, you've earned bragging rights.<br/><br/>Connect up to four nearby players for exciting real-time air-to-air combat. Players should be within Bluetooth range, or should be connected to the same Wi-Fi access point.<br/><br/>Not only are the aircraft realistic, but so too is the world in which you fly. Direct your wingman to fly in formation or to come to your aid. Request landing clearance from the control tower or get guidance from the Landing Signal Officer on final approach to a carrier landing.<br/><br/>The game includes 16 practice missions and 25 campaign missions. (More to come in future updates.) Increase your score with each mission and with every downed enemy aircraft. Earn awards and promotions as your career advances. Hours of gameplay wait.<br/><br/>You'll get a taste of what its like to be fighter pilot. If you're interested in aviation, or military history, then FA-18 Hornet is for you. <br/><br/>* Requires iPhone\u00ae 5 or later, iPod touch\u00ae 5th generation or later, or iPad\u00ae 2 or later or iPad Pro\u2122.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/1650f02857c1eb1f84a731ef92380207_k4GEia6.jpg", "website": "http://www.graphsim.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Graphsim Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Graphic Simulations"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
