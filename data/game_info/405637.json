Still open to criticism.\u00a0This was a small game development project for my computer science class. I had a little bit over a week (1 week and 2 days)\u00a0to program this in Pygame with some limitations set by my teacher. There isn't a lot of content\u00a0and I focused a lot on mechanics rather than gameplay.\u00a0 Also its only windowed mode\u00a0:P.</em></p>\n<p>If the concept is interesting to you guys, maybe I can make an actual game of this. Like. Properly.</p>\n<p><em>Aside from that, I hope you enjoy the game!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:30:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdca5472081080af4d0c658305102ca2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Setchi"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
