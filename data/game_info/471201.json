Tutorial available in game!</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Out of Control\".</p><p><strong>Post Jam Update:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Difficulty slider and score system, difficulty only affects how much HP you have.</li><li>Added a map which shows your and the controller pickup's position</li><li>Updated map with more cover and an extra route between floors</li><li>Changed the way spawning works, should now no longer have huge mobs showing up out of nowhere as often, instead a more steady stream of foes.</li><li>New Main and Game Over Menus.</li><li>A bunch of other little bug fixes I\u00a0don't remember.</li></ul><p><strong>- Original Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Collect as many Game Controllers as you can while taking care of enemies as you go! The enemies aren't only going to damage your health, they're going to be messing with your precious settings - your mouse sensitivity, camera FOV, and even your Reticle placement are all subject to change as you take hits.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0know what you're thinking, \"That's it?\u00a0Can't I\u00a0just change the settings back?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well... sure, you can - BUT! While in the menu your player is no longer under your control, instead taking directions from an unpredictable AI who has no idea what the objective is or how not-to-die. So be quick!</p>\n<p>Features 4 different guns which all handle differently - of course, you don't get to choose when and where each of these guns will be available. They switch round-robin style each time you get a kill - even if you get a kill while changing weapons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's about it, i think... Oh, yeah - the Rocket Launcher has splash damage which can damage you, so be careful with those weapon switches.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! Please lemme know what you think, this is my first ever GMTK Jam submission after missing the last three so I'm excited to play everyone elses games!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:00:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d06db4bc85055a45087e4a49c38a9716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["penandum"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
