If Charles (The blue dog) comes into your office, flip up your monitor for a few seconds and make sure they are gone before you flip it back down, Bonnie (The beige coloured bear) Will walk down the hallway, DONT CLOSE THE DOOR ON HIM! Until his eyes turn red, Boney (the withered lion) will run down the east hallway, lock him out before he reaches the office.
