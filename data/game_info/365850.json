Willing to kill many villagers, the warlock had created a dark portal inside a cave at the top of the Mount Parya, and it's up to you to get rid of the foul monsters that are spawning from the portal.\u201d\u00a0 <br/><br/>This is a very simple and short game I made in only a weekend. I had this idea from a Jam description I saw, where the challenge was to make a game with only 2 available buttons to play. I have merged this rule with other rules from the official RPG Maker forums, where there is a challenge where you can only use one map, 10 switches, 10 variables and 10 events. <br/><br/>  You will only need to use the <up> key and the <enter> key on your keyboard to play this game.\r\n<br/><br/>  There is a scoring system, where you can print your hi score and post it online.<br/><br/>  I hope you have fun playing it!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The cover image was made by Gr\u00e9gory Nunkovics, a real talented artist.
