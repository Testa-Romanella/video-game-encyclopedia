You must defeat it, but there is a catch. Only one weapon is capable of defeating this great evil and you have to survive long enough to find it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This is a small game we made for the GMTK Game Jam. We wanted to test out the idea of desperatly trying to survive while throwing weapons at the boss hoping one would work, like we would totally do in real life. Also our artists had fun designing random useless weapons :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:07:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a34179b8cad618575d84b05795a0306.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Pryzmat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
