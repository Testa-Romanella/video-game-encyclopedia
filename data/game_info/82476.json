{"id": 82476, "slug": "sequence-2", "name": "Sequence+", "name_original": "Sequence+", "description": "Sequence+ - a cool version of the classic memory sequence game, with a couple of new twists. <br/><br/>It's fully customizable - change the skin, change the background, change the sounds - it's all up to you.<br/><br/>And did we mention twists? Well, we mean that literally - enable the rotation mode and after each successful sequence, the board rotates 90 degrees. Or for an extra challenge, try the random mode - each time you get a sequence correct, the segments move to a random position!! <br/><br/>There is also a high-score table to keep track of your progress, and three skill levels - just in case it gets too hard for you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T09:19:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1e/b1efe3450c2ff2e0639df1d5b444d4e2.jpg", "website": "http://sequence.sygem.com/ios", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SyGem Software"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SyGem"], "esrb_rating": null}
