At one point in my life, I had over 1000 PS1 games &amp; still to this day love playing them. I have always wanted to create an accurate rendition of what a PS1 game actually looks like &amp; after spending months fine-tuning my post-processing materials, I finally feel like I have achieved what I set out to do. I love horror games and I wanted to be the one to throw my hat in the ring &amp; have people experience what my version of a PS1-style game could be.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Love the artwork? Me too! My friend &amp; University peer Miranda Bennett Margrave handled the box art for After Hours.
