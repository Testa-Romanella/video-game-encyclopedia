With the PC and VR player taking two roles, replayability is limitless. The PC player must hide amongst NPC animal's within a safari scene and kill the 3 red animals to win. The VR player must find the PC player within the map and stab them with one of their 3 knives, while also trying not to kill any innocent animals along the way. If the VR player stabs 3 NPC animals, the PC player wins. If neither player completes their task within the time limit, it's game over and no one wins! As the PC player, try to fit in with the other animals as much as possible! As the VR player, look out for suspicious animals! Climb the buildings around the map to get a better view. Good luck and have fun playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T09:04:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac8/ac84d8db6ac6652fa170fcd750845326.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dan.wiltshire"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
