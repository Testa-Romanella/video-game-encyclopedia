I decided to make Robotron, but I decided to make a new Sprint game. Instead of racing against 3 A.I. drivers, you need to beat the timer before it hits zero. There are three medals for every lap to complete 3=bronze medal, 5=silver medal, 7=gold medal. Can you beat the Clock? I'm Striker from CrashFM.\u00a0Up arrow- Gas, left and right arrows- steering, and down arrow to reverse. Just a side note I didn't have the time to make the medals in the game sorry, but you can picture yourself as a winner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T04:51:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e39/e396c62824d83b978c29c7791bdf2db7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tflores2020"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
