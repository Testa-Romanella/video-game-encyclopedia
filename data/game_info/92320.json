You must reach safety before the crew freezes to death. Conserve energy, but keep moving, or your ship will be trapped in ice; maintain sane heating levels so your crew doesn't get sick; every once in a while reroute power to the galley to supply enough food; make sure any injury or sickness receives adequate treatment in the sick bay. And always remember that overloaded reactor degrades faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7db/7db1d28e839d8d0da39d941dc1375071.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Goblin Airship"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
