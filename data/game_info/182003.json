You can create your own game, whilst playing it at the same time.</p>\n<p>There are 2 world templates to pick from; Flatty World, and Base World.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Flatty World</strong>:\u00a0The first level created, Flatty World is true to it's name; being very flat. This level is reccomended for people who are starting the game and want to mess around.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Base</strong>: Base world is the level to use to create your very own levels! Here, there is a single platform (Which you can delete). It's reccomended that you play Flatty World before playing this.</li><li><strong>Sky</strong>: Sky is a level similar to Base World, except with a skybox.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0Once loaded into one of these worlds, you can spawn various items and objects to start creating your own mini level.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Keyboard / Mouse Scheme:</p>\r\nKeys:Action:W / Space/ Up ArrowJumpA / Left Arrow<br/>Move LeftD / Right ArrowMove RightLeft ClickGrab Object<br/>Right ClickDelete (Whilst holding onto object)QSpawn Menu\r\n<p>Join the Discord server, and get updates on my games!<br/>https://discord.gg/cPYDapr</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Thanks to:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>eons</li><li>KidsCanCode</li><li>GamesFromScratch</li><li>GDQuest</li><li>YeOldeDM</li><li>PetePete1984</li><li>The Godot Community</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Sounds come from freesound.org<br/>Fonts come from miniml.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d6631037bab6931429e55adfad1503d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harry Court"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
