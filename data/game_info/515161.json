The sea of trans-exclusionary feminist claims, especially on Twitter, is easy to get lost in and believe. Hopefully, TRANSMUSEUM presents a few basic information visualizations that will pique visitors' curiosity and perhaps incite further research.</p>\n<p>In terms of structure, I wanted to explore the more graphic capabilities of Bitsy to see if I\u00a0could convey information both through classic infographic means as well as through the visitor's interaction and wandering through the space. Of course, working with the limited room space that Bitsy offers, a lot of the information finds itself on signs, but I\u00a0think it was a very interesting first attempt at bridging the 'small world game' that Bitsy's engine promotes with the basic, constrained information I\u00a0was hoping to convey.</p>\n<p><strong>THE ROOMS</strong></p>\n<ol><li>BIMODAL DISTRIBUTION: dispelling sex as a binary</li><li>GETTING TREATMENT: step by step process</li><li>THINK OF THE CHILDREN: a surgical fear fantasy</li><li>BATHROOM BILL: fear-mongering</li><li>DETRANSITION: the actual numbers</li></ol>\n<p><strong>SOURCES</strong></p>\n\n<p>Barnett, Brian S., Ariana E.
