{"id": 536196, "slug": "the-shattered-lens-a-light-module", "name": "The Shattered Lens: A Light Module", "name_original": "The Shattered Lens: A Light Module", "description": "<p>Descend into the Vault and discover what exactly is happening within this ancient structure in this module for Light. Inspired by the Vault of Glass Raid from the original Destiny, Beacons must fight their way through a swath of enemies, both new and old, to confront the problems at the center of the Vault, and save the Lens from being destroyed forever. Difficult, yet fun, this module hopes to provide the outline for a GM and their squad (probably 2-4 optimally, but, you know, a classic six-person fireteam is sure to work wonders). Fully compatible with other Light modules. Shout-out to Gila RPGs for putting together both the jam and Light, and good luck to the Beacons that seek to unlock the secrets of the Vault.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T06:13:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/007cde50fad9a3932f9c1c4309fbe23a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retorox"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
