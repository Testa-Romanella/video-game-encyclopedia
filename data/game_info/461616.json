The design limitation required that the whole game be played in a single room. I've been studying Unity3d on Udemy so I thought I would try it out. Development\u00a0went really well and the Unity Asset Store made it very easy to put together this great looking scene.</p>\n<p>Thanks to\u00a0Mike Koenig from SoundBible\u00a0for some of the sound effects and all the great folks who have put their Asset Packs up for public use on the Unity Asset Store. They made this project possible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T06:04:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35f/35f16b35d667f4b19534b15a9a8f6440.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AdmiralEnto"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
