In North America, it was manufactured and distributed by Midway Games.</p>\n<p>Bosconian allows the player's ship to freely roam across open space which scrolls in all directions. The game also has a radar, which tracks the position of the player's ship, the formation attacks, and the space stations.</p>\n<p>It uses Namco Galaga hardware, but with a video system like that used in Rally-X.</p>\n<p>A sequel game, Blast Off, was released in 1989 in Japan only; it runs on Namco System 1 hardware and bears more resemblance to Namco's own Dragon Spirit than Bosconian. A related title, Final Blaster, was released in 1990 for the PC-Engine in Japan only, and featured gameplay very akin to Blast Off.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/acc54b97f7e1a0f6cf4d5c9e0aa94b6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Wii"], "developers": ["NAMCO"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Namco", "Midway Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
