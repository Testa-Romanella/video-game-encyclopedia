{"id": 324670, "slug": "capsule-guy", "name": "Capsule Guy", "name_original": "Capsule Guy", "description": "<p>(Also check out the GameJolt page)</p>\r\nCapsule Guy is a challenging platforming game where you shoot lasers at things and win sometimes.\r\n<p>Made mostly by myself (@1f1n1ty_)\u00a0in four months as a capstone project for\u00a0a year-long independent study in game development. Although it's not a stunning game, for a larger scale project than all my previous endeavors,\u00a0I'm really happy with how this turned out and by extension the direction of my game creating passion! At least I think that's how it works</p>\n<p>As this is an academic project, I don't want to compel anyone to spend money to play it, but I encourage you to donate if you feel so inclined! It would mean a lot to me. You can make a one-time donation directly on this page or go to my Patreon\u00a0to support all of my work.\u00a0If you can't, though, spreading the word is fine with me :)</p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you enjoy!</p>\r\nFeatures, to an extent:\r\n<ul><li>Laser shooting, which is an unoriginal yet oddly charming concept</li><li>30 handcrafted levels, so that the frustration you get from the difficulty is completely intentional</li><li>5 enemy types, which is a new world record and breaks several boundaries</li><li>4 original songs (downloadable on my Bandcamp for everyone interested, and for everyone not interested)</li><li>A minimalist art style, which in this case is just a lazy cop-out for not being an artist</li><li>Some secrets to find, but\u00a0without any in-game consequences that would otherwise distract from the actual secret</li></ul>\r\nCredits, abridged:\r\n<ul><li>Matthew Zhang - Developer</li><li>Brandon Barber - Mentor</li><li>More credits in the game</li></ul>\r\nImportant notes:\r\n<ul><li>Controls: Keyboard + Mouse. Seriously these levels are designed for mouse and without one it's very hard.</li><li>Aspect Ratio: 16x9 fullscreen highly recommended.</li><li>Platforms: Windows + MacOS. Linux users, I apologize.</li><li>Made with: Unity, FMOD, FL Studio, and LOVE &lt;3</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T04:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/107f110a4250ffda0648981d1840b5a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["1f1n1ty"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
