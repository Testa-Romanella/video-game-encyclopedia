{"id": 490753, "slug": "a-game-of-humans", "name": "A Game of Humans", "name_original": "A Game of Humans", "description": "A sandbox village simulation fundamentally about people.<h3>Overview</h3>You start the game on an empty procedurally generated map in the wilderness. You place plots (homes &amp; workplaces) which people immigrate to and buy. The coins you make from plot sales allow you to pay people to accomplish tasks, like building roads and clearing forests. Your people will carry out jobs you make for them or start their own businesses on plots you have put up for sale. They will fulfill their needs and live their lives as they see fit. The only way you can affect people is either indirectly or by the use of faith powers. Faith powers allow for the placing of blessings &amp; curses on people, costing or generating faith.<h3>Plots</h3>You do not place houses/building directly in this game, rather you place plots and then houses are constructed on the plots by the plot owner. Once a plot has been sold to a citizen you as the player can no longer simply delete it, instead you must repurchase it at a greater price than the owner paid for it. And the owner probably wont be happy he was evicted...<h3>Characters</h3>Each character is unique. They all have their own needs, personalities and attributes which affects how they behave. The model affects their behavior, allowing for natural variations to occur, such as the quiet hardworking type, the lazy chatterbox and the stubborn madman, all within the framework. <br/>Characters also have two values that measure how they feel, mood &amp; happiness. Happiness is long term happiness while a mood is a mood. There are people who are perfectly happy but somewhat... unpleasant, in poor moods. How bad could they possibly act out though?<h3>Terrain</h3>The terrain is made up of fully editable blocks. For a small price your villagers will grab a shovel and shovel their hearts out to build that giant pile of dirt you always dreamt of.<h3>Economy</h3>Having made a simple home, your people will then seek to start businesses. It is up to you to sell plots to your people to make it happen.<br/>The economy is fully simulated, if your baker is not selling any bread due to oversupply then he will not be able to afford building a house. <br/>Rumor has it some folks dont take kindly to other folks having more or less money than one apparently ought to have...<h3>Faith</h3>In addition to coins your villagers will provide you with one additional resource, faith. Faith is what powers your divine abilities, faith powers. <br/>Do you have a shy but likable person you wish was more popular? One divine blessing of popularity coming right up.<br/>What about a rascal messing with your plans? Will a curse of foul smell be punishment enough or does he need to... suffer?<br/>Only by your graceful divine judgement can such delicate matters be settled.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T19:46:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb82c4cfdd0411dbfe2c837f4bae8202.jpg", "website": "http://www.agameofhumans.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scion Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Scion Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
