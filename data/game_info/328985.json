This is my first\u00a0<em>real\u00a0</em>game that I'm making. I can't promise that you'll like it but I would really appreciate it if you do check it out.</p>\n<p>So I like a couple of little games called UNDERTALE and OFF, this game was born from them. It's not a fangame of any sort\u00a0but it has\u00a0<strong><em>tons</em></strong> of inspiration from these games.</p>\n<p>It's made with RPG Maker MV so if RPG Maker games aren't your fancy that's fine just don't hate on\u00a0<em><strong>only</strong> </em>because it's made on this engine.</p>\n\n<p>If you own any of the music in this game and wish for it to be taken out of this game then please, tell me so I can fix it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T03:45:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f2/3f2d9c7f8c90c38c598021d47d3c0149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkyAkiyama"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
