{"id": 524287, "slug": "airtight", "name": "Airtight", "name_original": "Airtight", "description": "<p>Airtight is about a rocket ship that needs to make it to the end of 10 stages. Each time a stage is completed, the stage will shrink\u00a0and the stage will become harder. Complete the stage 3 times to move onto the next level. Made for the BenBonk Game Jam #2, with the theme of limited space. Use WASD or arrow keys to move.</p>\n<p>Difficulty</p>\n<p>There are two difficulty modes in the game, easy and hard mode. Difficulty changes how fast the ship moves.\u00a0Airtight was meant to be played on hard mode, but I realized this may be quite hard to certain players. So\u00a0I wanted to give players the option to play on a more forgiving mode that makes it just a bit easier to pull off those tough turns, and focus a bit more on the fuel puzzles. If you would like to switch difficulty mid game, press space, while the ship is still.</p>\n\n<p>Art, code and music by BeansBoi72</p>\n<p>Font -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/gamer-2.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:25:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38f/38f0921200a1cbd1581aecbd478d8128.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BeansBoi72"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
