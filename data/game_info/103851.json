That's how some of us live.</p><p>Anyways uhhhh right. The game. Hmmm I don't really have anything to sell you</p><p>so uh\u2026\u2026.Okay. I got it. I'll just explain what will be happening so there's no surprise.</p><p>In this game you play the life of a programmer trying to live a healthy lifestyle. It's summer break and he's got enough unbranded triangle chips and dry ramen to last a month. </p><p>Your job is to balance certain aspects of his life, such as...making sure he is eating enough,</p><p>getting enough rest, and most importantly...not going insane. </p><p>Not everyone can holdout in a room without suffering inside. </p>Maybe you have what it takes to get rid of the voices in his head. Actually, forget what I just said<p>[CONTROLS &amp; HOW TO PLAY]</p><p>[Left click] either the Microwave, Laptop, or Bed to bring up actions that will alter your stats.</p><p>If ANY of your stats reach zero then it's game over. In order to win you have to keep all your stats above zero for a full month. (~30 days)<br/></p><p>Good Luck &amp; Have Fun!</p><p>Oh! One more thing, the top option of each menu is a gamble. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't. However if you don't like randomness to be a factor I'm fairly positive that the game can be beaten without the use of randomness.</p><p>[EXTRA INFORMATION]</p><p>This game was created as part of a game jam and was completed in roughly 12 hours or so. We had a lot of fun making it and we'd like to hear what you've enjoyed and what you didn't. Feedback is feedback. :) </p><p>- Adrian Miasik</p><p>P.S. The WebGL Version has a lot of bloom, this was not intended :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a9/7a9ea73e2433d86b11c7e70f911e64a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AdrianMiasik"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
