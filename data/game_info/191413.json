The game is a clone of Crossy\u00a0Road, the massively\u00a0popular game by Hipster Whale.<br/></p>\n<p>This game demonstrates the following Unity/Programming principles:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Game states - initialisation, main game loop, post-game</li><li>Cross-Platform Development - The game was made and tested for PC and Android.</li><li>Random/Procedural Generation - the play area consists of rows that are randomly chosen with random elements (such as rock placement, direction and speed of sharks). A controller class creates the play board, adds new rows as the player progresses, and tidies up/removes rows that move off-screen.</li><li>Touch Inputs - Accepts touch input from a touch device (or mouse control in the PC version) to control the character. Both simple touch control to move forward or directional drag to move multi-directionally.</li><li>Sound - implements sounds on events such as movement or player death.</li><li>Linear Interpolation - The player character moves between movement points using a curve created by interpolating the start point, end point, and a generated point in the air between the two.</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:<br/>PC: AWSD or Direction Arrows<br/>Android/PC Mouse: Tap to\u00a0move forward, tap and drag forwards, backwards, left and right to move the respective direction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9dbf8f3689045ab1910602ded7e9d45c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Heath Gargit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
