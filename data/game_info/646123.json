You play as a test subject trying to escape his facility, you must use some of the DNA altering pills to allow yourself to escape.<br/></p><p>The sizing for the game is a bit bugged, so you have to play in full-screen mode to be able to see what you're doing. I'm really sorry about this, but all you're missing is that you move with the arrow keys or WASD, as well as what each pill does(put it down below). But another mechanic is that you can hold onto walls to keep yourself from falling by running into them.</p><p>Blue gives you a speed boost</p><p>Green decreases time between jumps</p><p>Orange makes it so you jump higher/farther</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:47:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92b0f6fb3712ebd81159f18acffcbcaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DevFaker"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
