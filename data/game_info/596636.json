I enjoyed making this game especially because I had to make my own engine and it was pretty fun. Also I would've made much more progress if my program wasn't so busy, because I worked on it just 3 or 4 days,\u00a0but I am satisfied with what I made so far.</p>\n<p>Movement:</p>\n<p>W,D - move horizontally</p>\n<p>SPACE - jump</p>\n<p>Z,V - dash</p>\n<p>In this game, you are a cube and you can jump and stuff. But, it isn't a normal platformer. Whenever you move, the enemy will move as well (mirrored movement). Your mission is to force the enemy to fall in the void. I'm also thinking of releasing some more updates for this game, creating more levels and redoing some of the rendering stuff.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about playing the game or some bugs or errors, please leave them in the comments!</p>\n<p>Also, on html5 the writing on the scene transitions can't be seen, but they are not that important anyways :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T19:19:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94c/94cda526a14050e3d1108b20370ce6e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stefanarctic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
