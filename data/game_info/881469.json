When many go to sleep, many others awake and reap. With a pareidolia, or a child\u2019s mind, you can hear and see them. Don\u2019t bother telling your parents, they won\u2019t listen - very few do. Tell a friend, tell a bear. They\u2019ll give you an ear, tell you there is nothing to fear. In turn, there will be less tears, and the world will become clearer.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>At night, you are not alone. Those noises you hear belong to the beings who appear. It\u2019s easy to be scared, but it\u2019s the light and your courage that they fear. And, your bears are out there in despair, without the one who cares. You must have courage and use your lantern to find all of them - be strong against the beings who disappear.</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em> </strong><strong>WASD</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Known visual bugs on wide screen monitors</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T10:20:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0d/c0df58ed3fa7b9666688b0f884755dcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FrightClub"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
