Performance is something that will have to be looked at but as long as you play some of the lower numbers you should be ok with a Radeon 390 or Nvidia 1060. I'd be happy if you report back with specs and if you're getting acceptable performance.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This has been tested on an HTC Vive only!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb1/fb10e3d11a037320710707604359f0a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pheroconstructs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
