I am planning on three stories in total.\u00a0 This demo contains 99% of the first story. It's a demo\u00a0because I am planning on improving the art. Current cover image is only a temporary choice. I have some CG ideas, too.\u00a0\u00a0If you have art talent and want to join the team, please contact me at my twitter.\u00a0This is a free project, but we can still negotiate. Estimated play time is 2-3 hours. The web version doesn't support save and load.</p>\n<p>I noticed the web version has some static noise. Unfortunately, it's hard to find free and high quality music, so I don't think there is an easy way to fix that. (Also there is a file size requirement on itch lol.) The desktop ver doesn't have this issue.\u00a0Desktop version is\u00a0not published yet.\u00a0 If you want a desktop version, you can contact me.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Script writing, coding: (this is me)</p>\n<p>TQ, https://twitter.com/TqAbstrac</p>\n<p>Sprite Artist:</p>\n<p>Mary, https://mirukimary.wixsite.com/mirukimary, https://twitter.com/MirukiMary</p>\n<p>GUI Artist:</p>\n<p>Sasha, https://sites.google.com/view/sasha-ines-artist/portfolio?authuser=0</p>\n<p>Proofreader:</p><p>EvergreenExpansion,\u00a0https://evergreenexpansion.com/?page_id=20</p><p>BGM:</p>\n<p>Myuu, Hopeless, Misconception, https://www.thedarkpiano.com/</p>\n<p>Bensound, Better Days, https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/better-days</p>\n<p>Bensound, Sad Day, https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/sad-day</p>\n<p>Oak Studio, dreaming, </p>\n\n<p>BG:</p>\n<p>All Pixabay, Pexels, or iStock images.
