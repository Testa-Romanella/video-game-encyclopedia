{"id": 307546, "slug": "attention-trainer-for-adhd", "name": "Attention Trainer for ADHD", "name_original": "Attention Trainer for ADHD", "description": "Use all your attention, concentration, and focusing skills to poke some pigs in this fun and fast-paced game.<br/><br/>Although this app is not intended to be used for diagnostic purposes*, it does mirror common methods clinicians use to assess individuals for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) tendencies. Namely, it requires the user to pay focused attention to a stream of stimuli (in this case, decorated pigs) and respond when the target stimulus appears. <br/><br/>And again, although not designed to provide treatment for ADHD*, this app also provides the type of cognitive training that is often used to help individuals who have the disorder. <br/><br/>Unlike those treatment methods, however, this app is designed more as a fun and interactive game. <br/><br/>To keep things interesting, there are eight separate variants that you can play; matching or not matching by either color, size, spots, or letter. The app records high scores for each type of game play. <br/><br/>Although users will quickly gain mastery by repeatedly playing a single game variant, it becomes increasingly challenging to alternate between game types. In this way, continued practice can actually enhance your ability to focus and concentrate, even if you do not have ADHD.<br/><br/>* If you suspect that you or or someone you love has symptoms of ADHD, please do not rely on this app for diagnosis or treatment. Instead, please consult a trusted physician and discuss your concerns.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:37:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/009/009da87d7bf88ba7d9ff5519940dfd01.jpg", "website": "http://www.projectiveart.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Joel Epstein"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Joel Epstein"], "esrb_rating": null}
