Between these fractures are plateaus. On these plateaus, there is life.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWelcome to Issue 1 of a regular mini-adventure series with a focus on character and world building. In small chunks you will get to know the people and places of this world, and hopefully be charmed by their... charm.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWith this free series I hope to use the webcomic model of providing free regular content, with occasional sponsors and donators and merch keeping it going. If all goes well I can use this to keep my belly fed while I work on projects that are either not making money any more (The Maker's Eden Act 3), or projects that are not making money yet. like the first of the threesome of bigger games in my to do list.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI'm also hoping to encourage people to donate sometimes to creators whose content they get enjoyment from. (even if it's not this one)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMusic by Ben Burnes, aka Abstraction.</p><p>You can also support this and future goodies on Patreon</p><p>Aaaaand lastly, definitely would appreciate some votes on Steam Greenlight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf7/cf73343a8611522241aa3425c1eda342.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Screwy Lightbulb"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
