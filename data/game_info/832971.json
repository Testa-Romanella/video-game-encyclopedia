With Hekopino I hope I can make a game in which has intresting story, but also part of the story is found by exploring (rather still small) world of <strong>Hekoponia.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Game is planed to have 7 village characters + some not decided enemy characters.<br/>Curently there are 3/7 village characters.<br/>Village Hunter, Village Head and Innovator.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This Game Day night cycle is synchronised to pc clock. Example when it is XX:X0 it will be sunny (day) when you enter game but\u00a0XX:X5 would be dark (night). Full 1 day is 10 minutes long.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0rl have high hopes for this project.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p><p>Please feel free to share your opinion in comments or discord.</p>\r\nRandom fact<p>To be fair name of game <strong>hekopino </strong>came from joining random parts of words..</p>\n\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T14:43:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3f/a3f602f76fb90628b761974dfeb3b4fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["pietru"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
