When shooting the planetoids are sliced where hit.</p><p>There are two game modes:<br/>Time trail: Try to destroy all 10 planetoids as fast as possible.<br/>Area attack: Destroy as much planetoids as possible without dying. New ones will spawn when enough have been destroyed.<br/><br/>Controls are simple, tap to shoot and hold to fly.<br/><br/>I also included leaderboards for both game modes. This uses the Google Play Services and will ask you to sign in. It is however completely optional and everything works even when you don't log in!<br/><br/>I hope you like it :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc7/dc7d9b7777ffbd71cce9826c0f4f4d0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["The Oddler"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
