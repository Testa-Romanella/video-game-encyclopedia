Deciding to explore, you became lost in the chaotic cacophony of turns and dead-ends residing below the surface. As you hear an ominous sound echoing through the tunnels ahead, you run toward the exit, and realize you have become lost. Find your way to safety before the Minotaur finds you.</p><p>      The Labyrinth is an atmospheric horror puzzle/maze game made in Unreal Engine 4. It is largely inspired by the Greek mythology surrounding the ancient maze made by the ancient inventor Daedalus. Just like the myth, there is a Minotaur that actively hunts you down as you search for the exit to the twisting jumble of catacombs that make up the Labyrinth. Every time you start the level, the maze is generated on the spot randomly, ensuring that the labyrinth is never the same experience twice!</p><p>There are four difficulty levels:</p><p>    ~Baby: only 200 tiles (2400 square meters), and there is no minotaur.</p><p>    ~Easy: 1000 or 12000 square meters.</p><p>    ~Normal: 2000 or 24000 square meters.</p><p>    ~Hard: 4000 tiles or about 48000 square meters.</p><p>This is still a work in progress, Not even the cover image for the game is done yet...
