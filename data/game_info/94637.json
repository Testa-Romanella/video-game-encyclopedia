Explore surrounding wilderness for resources and fend off invading predators and neighboring factions!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>This is the first playable Pre-Alpha of the game and is buggy and unoptimized. There is no gameplay currently, you only run around and pet Kobolds on a basic level. This is\u00a0intended to give a general impression and does not represent the final game. Everything is subject to change.</strong></p>\n<p>A DX11 capable graphics card is required and a medium to high tier PC is recommended. Older PCs and laptops will have a hard time running this game if at all. There will be new versions monthly, building on and optimizing the game to broaden the scope of platforms it can run on including Linux and Mac eventually.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>WASD: move</li><li>Shift: Run</li><li>LMB: Pet</li><li>Rmb: Carry</li><li>Escape: Pause</li></ul>\n<p>Controllers are currently not supported.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in getting early news and builds, consider supporting on Patreon!</p>\n<p>Patreon - Twitter - Tumblr</p>\n<p>Email: uwusoft@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Feel free to make videos and monetize them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df0/df0d94c3a0e9e5f9dd69366b28fc6d48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["uwusoft"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
