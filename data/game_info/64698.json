Storyline<br/>In the darkness, it calls to you. Silent, distant, like a half-remembered dream. It doesn't care who you are - thief, soldier, or nurse - it will claim you. It has claimed so many others. And you are next.<br/><br/>Something foul has corrupted Grabstein Prison, and you are one of the few souls spared this madness. You must work together with two (or is it three?) other lost souls to survive the riots, the darkness, the foul things that twist the minds of the prisoners, and the very walls of the prison itself.<br/><br/>Use whatever tools you find to navigate the blood-soaked prison, and uncover the mystery of who is behind the madness that now surrounds you...before you become a permanent resident.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e36ee55b590e4301df0238ee0f32cfec.jpg", "website": "http://www.aldorlea.org/blackhome2.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Warfare Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Warfare Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
