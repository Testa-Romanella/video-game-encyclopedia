Appetite Apocalypse is an early exploration of the system that handles colonist priorities. You can buy \"eaters\" who have two states: Eat, and wander; which they go back and forth between as you feed them. If you don't feed the eaters they will die and turn into food. But beware, if another eater eats a deceased eater it will become sick and start a chain reaction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T19:02:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51d856b111dbc8cfdf3d6fd94cb691eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jorotyn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
