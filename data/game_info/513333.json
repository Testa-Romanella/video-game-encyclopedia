This unholy abomination of a game is my take on a slightly different Minesweeper. The same rules apply except you're timed, you can get bonus time and shields as rewards for uncovering empty spaces, and there's boulders that fall from the sky. There are 5 levels in total and each level the size and bomb count of the board increases.</p>\n<p>As of the time of posting this I have just over 1 month of game development experience so it is still pretty rough around the edges. I may come back later on to clean it up but I don't have any plans to currently. This was an experiment in order to learn something new with a time restriction, I\u00a0don't really have any design to further ruin Minesweeper's name</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T03:15:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bd2740a69cef537f745d4ceaa80cc48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wyrlor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
