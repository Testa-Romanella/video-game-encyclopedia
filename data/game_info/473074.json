Our Otter awakes to find himself floating among debris. He hurriedly pulls himself onto the debris to avoid a shark.<br/><br/>Otter is unsure of what has become of the world, he must fish up debris to expand his fishing platform.\u00a0Otter must also fish up food to stay alive, as well as fight any sea predators that may cross your path.\u00a0The wind changes direction, which causes the fishing platform to float by large submerged structures such as buildings and cruise ships. These may sometimes collide with your platform, so make sure not to lose you platform to the churning of the ocean. You must investigate these structures for any sign of life, or tools and materials that may help you on your journey.<br/><br/>Engine work by Pingu_Pox:\u00a0https://pingu-pox.itch.io/<br/></p><p>Art by Crystalnight06:\u00a0https://crystalnight06.itch.io/<br/></p><p>Music by playmeapiece:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/playmeapiece</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:48:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fd/1fd59cc14666a257c39d510fa52951ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pingu_Pox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
