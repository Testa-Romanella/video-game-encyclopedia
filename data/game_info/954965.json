Hey, don't go away. This pack is a lot more interesting than the last one.</p>\n<p>The second in the Super Freaks Classic Pack series will combine and polish the Super Freaks' other old games, mostly the shooter adjacent ones. The exciting part is several of these games were not finished back in the day, and are being completed and uploaded for the first time. Let's go over the list:</p>\n<ul><li>Scruffy Rides Again (2007)</li><li>Quincy's 3D Adventure (by Kingnormal, 2009)</li><li>Strato-Scruffy (2009)</li><li>Scruffy Rides Again DX (2012)</li><li>Super Freaks: The Demo (2016)</li></ul>\n<p>Scruffy Rides Again, its DX version, and Quincy's 3D Adventure were all top down shooters. Rides Again focused more on powerups and goofy level design, while 3D Adventure had a much more cinematic story than any other Super Freaks game.<br/></p>\n<p>Strato-Scruffy has been hotly anticipated since 2009 (yes really). This interesting shmup features more platformer-esque level design and is known for a lot of crazy graphical effects and cool looking bosses for its time. Strato-Scruffy was roughly half completed in 2009 before the spaghetti code became too hard for my younger self to do anything with, but now I'll be finishing where I started, and even rebalancing the game and adding 16:9 widescreen and 60fps.</p>\n<p>Super Freaks: The Demo was the only one of these to be made available online. It sprouted from the ashes of another old game and\u00a0was basically a testbed of ideas for the long in-development Super Freaks 4ever. It was submitted to SAGE 2016.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to play a genuinely polished game while you wait for these, check out the in-development Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition, my current main project:\u00a0Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition by SuperFreaksDev (itch.io). <br/></p>\n<p><strong>DEMOS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Two things are currently available from this pack:</p><p>One is a public demo of Strato-Scruffy featuring 7 out of 16 planned levels. <br/>The other is Super Freaks: The Demo (2016).</p><p>I'll have more available soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T11:41:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d96c3d61c79338c71cd90149fb07745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperFreaksDev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
