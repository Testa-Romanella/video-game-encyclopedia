In this world, you can wrap the screen at any time, so that you emerge from the left when exiting right, and falling down a pit turns into falling from the ceiling. Discover a strange world where a man and woman journey through four seasons in a year, constantly separated by the boundaries of the screen.<br/><br/>Each new season in the game brings a new twist to screen wrap. Just as you think you've mastered a screen wrap mechanic, the world will change its rules and present a new way for you to look at the confines of your screen.</p><ul><li>Serenity Forge Website: http://serenityforge.com</li><li>Serenity Forge Twitter: @SerenityForge</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6f/d6f7af701375da495aa3f171ffe5de4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Serenity Forge"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
