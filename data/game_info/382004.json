I suggest playing the Web version, but for some reason it does not seem to load on some devices or shows a black background on others. Please try one of the downloadable builds if this is the case for you. I did not have time to test the Windows version yet. <br/>Sourcecode is available, if you are interested, but it's of course all quite messy... ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:24:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6dbdd84479f1ce716b1c8285e160d7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Chasethechicken"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
