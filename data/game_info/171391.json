It's a toy and a DIY robot remote control. In the game you control a blue four-legged robot, a \"quadrapus.\" Its legs mimic your fingers. Controlling this virtual robot is fun all by itself, but should you want to go further YOU CAN. You'll need a four-legged robot. I recommend the SunFounder Crawling Quadruped for Arduino. Connect it to your computer. Upload this open source code to the robot. Then hit \"Open Serial Port\" and you'll look like you're a god damn Jedi controlling a robot with a flick of your hand!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you like this game, you'll like Quadrapus Sumo, a game where you and a friend control four-legged robots in a king-of-the-hill competition.
