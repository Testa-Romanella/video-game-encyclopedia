The slimes colour will determine the element of your spell: Fire, water or nature. Collect coins by using the opposite element to what colour the portal is:</p>\n<ul><li>Fire is effective against a green portal</li><li>Water is effective against a red portal</li><li>Nature is effective against a blue portal</li></ul>\n<p>Avoid the slimes overtaking the arena, if the bar on the right side of the screen reaches 100% you lose.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>A/D:</strong> Move left or right</li><li><strong>SPACE: </strong>Charge spell with nearby slimes</li><li><strong>LMB:</strong> Cast spell when fully charged</li></ul>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I got carried away and it took more than 3 hours to complete this project. In total, I've spend a bit more than 5 hours trying to make the gameplay work.</p>\n\r\nThanks to all these awesome creators for their assets:\r\n<p>Peaceful nightfield platformer tiles by Trixie<br/>https://trixelized.itch.io/nightfield</p>\n<p>Witches pack by 9E0<br/>https://9e0.itch.io/witches-pack</p>\n<p>Animated slimes by Stealthix<br/>https://stealthix.itch.io/animated-slimes</p>\n<p>Portal by Ruxar<br/>https://ruxar.itch.io/portal</p>\n<p>Fireballs Pixel Effect by XYEzawr<br/>https://xyezawr.itch.io/free-pixel-effects-pack-13-fireballs</p>\n<p>Water spell effect &amp; Wind spell effect by pimen<br/>https://pimen.itch.io/water-spell-effect-02<br/>https://pimen.itch.io/wind</p>\n<p>Pixel coins by TotusLotus<br/>https://totuslotus.itch.io/pixel-coins</p>\n<p>Space background by VectorPixelStar<br/>https://vectorpixelstar.itch.io/space</p>\n<p>8Bit-16Bit Sound Effects by JDWasabi<br/>https://jdwasabi.itch.io/8-bit-16-bit-sound-effects-pack</p>\n<p>DOS88 Music Library by DOS88<br/>https://dos88.itch.io/dos-88-music-library</p>\n<p>8-Bit Sound Effects Library by Little Robot Sound Factory<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-sound-effects-library</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T14:08:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/2101aebf627f6ec6056000af45292a96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aereton"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
