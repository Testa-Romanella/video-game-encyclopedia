But that was years ago. You left that life behind, it was hard, it took its toll, and for the most part, you're content. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, for some reason tonight feels different, and in a way, almost familiar. As you were watching football it begins to eat at you and dredge up the old question that you were in a unique position to answer. In your experience, sometimes the monsters are real.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMind Shadows is a phycological horror game that takes you through a short horror experience as you live through events set in Vietnam, explore a 1980's house and try to piece together if this is reality, or all in your mind.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T03:43:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c3/3c31ae59ae76eeae9c38b24aa1344d42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AMPro"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["AM Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
