I was the lead designer and programmer for a couple of microgames.\r\n</p>\n<p>PCWell is a game whose purpose is to educate children and young people about the dangers of the Internet, scams, possible viruses and how to identify them. To do this, it uses two systems, one with a 3D world, in which they must manage resources to buy antivirus units that defend the PC, and another based on 2D microgames in which they must identify which of the games are malicious and which are not, close the that are malicious and resolve those that are benign. By doing this task well, you will get coins that will be used to buy antivirus units.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is infinite and its difficulty increases progressively. It is completely in Spanish, as it was created following the teaching guidelines of Spain.</p>\n<p>The other ones who made this project posible:\u00a0https://jorgebg12.itch.io/\u00a0 (the remaining will be added as soon as I got their profiles)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T12:01:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80d41c8b732ec4a64446d84f38cc3069.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThePurpleRaven"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
