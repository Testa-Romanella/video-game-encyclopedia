Lose yourself in the lovingly hand-painted alien world of Viridis Primus. Ensure the success of the colony as you make friends and pursue romance with a diverse cast of characters. Demonstrate your mastery of the farming system by creating the perfect crop hybrid using the genetic splicing machine - or spend your days painting and making pottery. The possibilities are endless!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith many natural skin tone options and tons of unique hair styles and clothing choices you can easily craft your perfect avatar. Unlike many games in this genre, Verdant Skies doesn't ask you to choose a gender when you create your character. As you help to grow the colony, you will unlock additional datable residents.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSplit your time wisely between activities as you help to build your colony. Gather resources, decorate your home, grow crops, go spear fishing, cook interesting meals, befriend your fellow colonists, and maybe even fall in love...", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02a/02aaa6d11519d9610750d224da64df11.jpg", "website": "http://verdantskies.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 80, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 71, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Howling Moon Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Howling Moon Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
