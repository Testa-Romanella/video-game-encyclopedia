No objectives either. You can do anything you want. Even farming the lowest monster will yield satisfactory results! You can trade, gamble in tavern, party with friends, pvp solo with your rouge or go after rare loots!<br/><br/><br/>Adventure Land wasn't originally a Code based game, during early development, it ended up a bit like a Clicker MMORPG, simple but fun. Then came Code, to let machines do the clicking! So it's not something extremely complex no one can understand, it's just basic automation!<br/><br/><br/>Mage, Warrior, Rogue, Ranger, Priest and Merchant. All with different, easy to understand, but unique skills. There are no skill trees or the need to pick attributes, it's all automatic to keep things simple. Items provide some depth, and Code adds some variation to the mix.<br/><br/><br/>There's a lot to work on. Daily Events, Paladin Class, Pets, Guilds (or Familias, as they will be small), New Zones, New Items, New Skills. All features are shaped and vetted by the playerbase.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/246/246f49d8ee5c167aa4d7f33972fa8202.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 15}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaan Soral"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kaan Soral"], "esrb_rating": null}
