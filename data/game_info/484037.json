It will be up to you to light up the world\u00a0again! Everything will be dark, but don't panic. Proceed carefully and you shall overcome this challenge. Good luck!</p>\n<p>This is a simple and easy to play mini game for everyone. Just follow the path to the lighting point.</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - move your player</p>\n<p>Alt+F4 to quit the game midway.</p>\n\n<p>Team Background:</p>\n<p>We are a group of two people from Japan. Both of us are\u00a0fx artists, so it was a challenge handling everything that goes into game creation (especially blueprints!!). We aimed to have a cool visual so we tried to put in as much detail as possible. There are always rooms for improvement, but we are happy with what we have accomplished in a short amount of time. Looking forward to hearing any feedback. Hope you enjoy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team Info</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Team Name: TERASU</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Game Name: Light Up</li><li>How was Houdini used in Light Up?</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Terrain mesh creation</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Terrain heightmap creation</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Texture creation\uff08SmokeFX\uff09</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-RBD sims</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-road generator (converted to HDA and used within UE4)</p>\n<ul><li>Tools used other than Houdini</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Photoshop (texture editing)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Substance Designer (texture creation)</p>\n<ul><li>Contents created before the jam that was included in the final submission</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-Base Blueprint setup.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-hip file (shared hip from Entagma)</p>\n\n<p>Below is a short video on how we used Houdini in our game.
