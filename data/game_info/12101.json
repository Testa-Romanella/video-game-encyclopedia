The application will include scans from the brain, abdomen, heart, lungs, spine, and allow users to import their own DICOM files.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUsers will be able to directly interact with these models using hand controls, allowing a level of engagement on par with high end virtual reality applications. These controllers will allow the user to scale, rotate, and crop scans freely in 3D space.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUsers can add annotations to specific areas within a scan, to indicate lesions and tumors. The volumes can then be saved and uploaded to be viewed anywhere in the world, all patient health information is removed in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can select between multiple preset color schemes and even create your own. There are multiple environments built in to the Anatomy Viewer to suit your preference.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo apply to the private beta contact us at http://TheBodyVR.com/contact/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e5/1e539e03b69c8a54ad635e9f7c53e2e3.jpg", "website": "http://thebodyvr.com/medical-training/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Body VR"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": ["The Body VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
