It is supposed to present the user with the choice of building something that generates a lot of a resource but produces a lot of pollution, or build something that produces less pollution but doesn't generate as much of that resource. The goal of the game is to have the player learn about a good balance between the two and why both types of resource generation are needed to sustain our way of life.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Artists</p><ul><li>Kaleb Hogan</li><li>Jacob Moore</li></ul><p>Producer</p><ul><li>Dell Barnes</li></ul><p>Programmers</p><ul><li>Connor Douglas</li><li>Henry Schaefer</li><li>Zachary Frye</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8f099f3c9f9a8a468f39dd1e145740c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zfrye06"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
