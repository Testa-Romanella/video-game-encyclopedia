Each level has a grid of tiles, with one or more safe paths across, but one wrong step will cost you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The catch? You only get one short look at the tiles before they disappear and you must remember where to step to cross to safety.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Programmer by trade I\u00a0decided to try and focus on playing around with things other than the code for this project, so I picked up blender and learned to do some basic 3D for the first time in over a decade, and then just played around creating a paper/cardboard look for the game. By no means perfect, but I'm happy with it for what it is.</p>\n<p>Have been playing around with audio too, attempting to create a spooky and unsettling vibe in the caverns, but none of that VO work is currently in the game, looking to add that shortly, but may not make it in before the end of the jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T06:41:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed0/ed05efc951890910f38e674b735d9a96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FatWednesday"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
