It's also my first game made with unreal engine, wahoo!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T05:33:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fc/8fcb5e9d0621e5e445290779b06f5e58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jorandp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
