Find your way out of the sewers populated by giant alligators, sewer rats, frogs, and other megafauna. Three levels, three bosses, and an extra bonus level.<br/><br/>Jump, double jump, and charge your melee attack to unleash ranged power attacks. Plug in a controller and let a second player join to help with co-op.<br/><br/>Graphics are heavily modified from Kirby's Dreamland and Kirby's Adventure. Music is from Blaster Master 2 and sound effects are from The Incredible Hulk on Sega Genesis.</p><p>Want to support my free games?\u00a0 I sell merchandise featuring characters and designs from some of my most well received games. Every purchase helps me to not starve on my way to releasing my next game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba6/ba693d5d8956317ea1bcca561892cf9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["William John Holly"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
