You can play with up to 4 players or computers in local multiplayer matches. Gameplay consists of hectic tag team fights where you can call a support character to help you out. The game is very early so there's only one character to play as but I'm hoping to add additional characters over time.</p>\n<p>You can play with either keyboard or controller but check out my blog post for in depth details on how to play.</p>\n<p>Feel free to contact me about bugs using this email address: TravisJB101@gmail.com</p>\n<p>If you want casual updates from time to time check out my\u00a0Twitter.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my game and I hope you enjoy!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T06:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/5896383989371672002b693238b6c101.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Travis Barnes"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
