This combines the fast-paced action of a top-down arcade game with the strategy of an RPG. Pick your unique combination of 5 different and unique abilities and fight evil aliens. One shot will take you down, you are a glass cannon after all! This is my first ever solo project and it's a little rough around the edges but I'm happy on what I was able to accomplish in under 48 hours. Feedback is much appreciated!</p>\r\nThanks for Playing!\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> - Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> - Movement Keys</p>\n<p><strong>LShift.
