Be careful, red slides a good bit. You lose 1/40 of your red swatch each second, as well as 1 second per wrong-colored tile you move over.</li><li><strong>As Blue:\u00a0</strong>You can walk up walls, as well as across ceiling tiles. You stick to surfaces pretty well. You lose 1/30 of your blue swatch each second, as well as 1 second per wrong-colored tile you move over.</li><li><strong>As Yellow:\u00a0</strong>You can use your mouse to sling yourself across the map. You are extremely sticky and will hardly ever move when attached\u00a0(similarly to blue). You lose 1 out of 10 yellow swatches for each uncolored tile you land on (including some splatter), as well as 1 additional swatch for each wrong-colored tile you land on.</li><li><strong>As Green:\u00a0</strong>You have a simple turret that you can control with your mouse. Each shot takes 1 of your 10 green swatches and, in the case that you switch colors while airborne, you will lose a swatch for landing on a wrong-colored tile.</li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>Gamepad usage is not properly implemented. It will work for some colors, but not all.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T14:41:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c3/3c3d239ccd55dfb03d94b5cd27d527da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JREntertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
