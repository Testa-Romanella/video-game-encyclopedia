The goal was for me to try and see what I could do, and finally finish a projec.  Although it took me 10 weeks to \"finish\" it (which is probably way too long), and\u00a0my code might look like a tribute to Chaos to anyone brave enough to look at it, I'm quite happy with the result nonetheless. I plan on fixing a few things here and there depending on the feedback and future personal tests, then move on to something else to keep on learning. <br/></p>\n<p>Known bugs : <br/></p>\n<p>-Stamina amount sometimes flies over the top.</p>\n<p>-End of level triggers are weird .<br/></p>\n<p>- Bob's Radio trigger is weirder.</p>\n<p>- End of game trigger is weirdest.<br/></p>\n<p>-Movements can still happen when they're not supposed to.<br/></p>\n<p>- The overall melee system is still quite clunky and probably not super fun. \u00a0Focus on gunplay instead.</p>\n<p>- It is possible to break through invisible walls if you try hard enough.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy it anyways, I had lots of fun crafting these levels and features and learnt so many things (also a lot of frustation sometimes, let's be honest !)</p>\n<p> Overall a great experience as a \"\"junior developper\"\", I hope it will still be interesting to play from the player's perspective. Leave a comment if you feel like it, that will be much appreciated. Cheers ! <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Paul of the Dead</p>\n\n<p>PS : the cat's named Nephtys, but you can call her Bibounette.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------CREDITS -------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>(is this done correctly ?
