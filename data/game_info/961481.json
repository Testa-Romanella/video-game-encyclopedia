And then everything changed. Crazy told them all, more than once. He told them not to set up a balloon animal factory at the circus... but no one would listen. Within days, the equipment went out of control due to AI software attempting to take over the world, and the circus became an immediate disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEveryone ran away except Crazy. Even though nobody was there anymore, he told them that he wasn't crazy; he knew this would happen. Help Crazy smash all of the renegade balloon animals and save the circus (and the world). Even though it would be much more effective to use a sharp object to pop all of the balloon animals, Crazy loves his hammer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n3 difficulty levels (plus 2 more after the breakthrough)<br/>\r\nSpecial cannon blast assist after the breakthrough<br/>\r\nBreakthrough requires a game restart after getting past 50 at any difficulty<br/>\r\n50 levels of increasing speed and difficulty.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-29T03:48:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b48b0a825e7f13af77d12d7d71fed0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom's Feral Cat Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tom's Feral Cat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
