This is based on the battle screen like Final Fantasy and Pok\u00e9mon. It is a really good concept that could be implemented into a game. I have made the focus around the battle screen only.</p><p>If I\u00a0had more time/motivation I would have polished this a lot more and focused on the potion side to be bigger. AP (action Points) was meant to be a thing to allow you to select more then one action per turn but I did not want to scope too big and miss the game jam.</p><p>I hope you enjoy my submission.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T22:49:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/409/409f9bbd0de7814de1fb13d57598f058.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JACKO4590"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
