It was intended to be an exploration and combination of a few of his works, specifically the two paintings shown below. By blending the strong colors and minimalist feeling of the first with the suggested moving pieces\u00a0of the second, I\u00a0wanted to create a relaxing, yet fun experience.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>===================================</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD keys to move</p>\n<p>Space to pick up colors</p>\n<p>Space to place a carried color in an open space</p>\n<p>Mouse to navigate menus and select levels</p>\n<p>===================================<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the 2021 Paintings Jam.
