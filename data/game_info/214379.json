No changes to gameplay have been made.\u00a0Notable changes:</p>\n<ul><li>Optimized a handful of draw calls.</li><li>Added the ability to resize the game window as the user sees fit. On some machines, maximized window provides sufficient detail where fullscreen does not perform well.</li><li>Fixed a glitch that allowed players to clip through a wall in Room 4 into Room 5, but mislabeled as Room 1.</li><li>Fixed a glitch where hitting Escape to end the game at the final screen would send the user back to the main menu instead of closing the game.</li><li>Very minor HUD adjustments (some orange text coloration; version number information).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be9/be9d83e4caa2a55477ddbaab74b526ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TehPilot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
