{"id": 772461, "slug": "xenoseekers", "name": "XenoSeekers", "name_original": "XenoSeekers", "description": "<p>43 Years Ago, an unidentified alien spacecraft, broke apart in low orbit. Debris from the wreck was scattered across the Earth. This was just the beginning, as soon, large parts of the spacecraft collided with Earth, including its reactor. The reactor\u2019s fumes coated the planet with a toxic substance that caused mutations across species. The remnants of humanity appropriated the alien tech found in the debris to build domed cities and survive. Unfortunately, replacement parts couldn\u2019t be made, so a new initiative was required. Enter the Relic Seekers: those who travel the wasteland searching for alien technology. Your personal goal? Make as much money as possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0CAUTION: This game is actually pretty hard. For best experience use an XBox controller.<br/></p>\n<p>Features:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>5 Dungeons\r\n  </li><li>50+ Items\r\n  </li><li>25+ Enemies\r\n  </li><li>A killer soundtrack\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Q,E / RB,LB \u2013 Turn\r\n  </p>\n<p>W,A,S,D / Left Joystick \u2013 Move\r\n  </p>\n<p>J/A \u2013 Interact / Basic Attack\r\n  </p>\n<p>K/B \u2013 Menu / Cancel\r\n  </p>\n<p>L/Y \u2013 Drop Flare\r\n  </p>\n<p>Left Shift / X \u2013 Sprint\r\n  </p>\n<p>Sprint + Interact \u2013 Skip Turn</p>\n\n<p>Strategy - Home Base</p>\n<p>- Sleep in the bed to save the game.

Bandages replenish health. Batteries replenish your robot's energy. Pills increase your maximum health permanently. Capacitors increase your maximum energy permanently. Whetstones increase your basic damage permanently. Scrap sells for a lot of money and has no other use. Gears are attack and utility modules, they are extremely rare and you should always make them a priority.

Flares can be used to mark where you've been and help navigation significantly pre-minimap</p>\n<p>- pressing J will allow you to use a basic attack, it is weak but costs nothing</p>\n<p>- within the k menu you can use items or robot attacks</p>\n<p>- there is no reward for killing enemies they are simply an obstacle</p>\n<p>- if you hear boss music...
