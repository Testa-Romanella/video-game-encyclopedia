Their cells contain 'keep fit' equipment,<br/>\r\nincluding a wall ladder that Head really must learn to climb. Your job is<br/>\r\nto get them both out of the castle and into the market place so they can<br/>\r\njoin up again. From there, the journey leads to Moonbase Headquaters, where<br/>\r\nyou will have to decide either to try to escape back to Freedom or to be a<br/>\r\ntrue hero and teleport to one of the slave planets to search for its lost<br/>\r\ncrown! To overthrow the dictatorship on any of the slave planets would be a<br/>\r\nmajor blow to Blacktooth and you could return to Freedom in glory. Of course<br/>\r\nBlacktooth would probably enslave them again eventually but it would slow<br/>\r\ndown any expansion plans for now. The populace of Blacktooth are so heavily<br/>\r\noppressed that they would have to see all four of the slave planets revolt<br/>\r\nbefore the Blacktooth crown could cause an uprising. This of course would be<br/>\r\nthe ultimate accolade, and unfortunately, almost certain suicide.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T04:48:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/262/262b5d5aa1c5a273a0a9436964d8f4bd.jpg", "website": "http://pikointeractive.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 274, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retrospec"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Piko Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
