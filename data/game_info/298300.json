Goal of the player is to place the highest number of deadly obstacles possible in the stage, choosing from a given set that is different from each level, without getting the character killed. The highest is the number of obstacles put in the level, the highest is the final score, that can vary from 1 to 3 stars.<br/>The main character cannot be directly controlled by the player, but instead he will move accordingly to a specific pattern that will be shown at the beginning of each level. The player must choose carefully the position of the different obstacles, since once that the Start button is pressed, it is no longer possible to change it anymore!<br/>Things may appear very simple at first, but gradually the combinations between obstacles increase in complexity and the levels turn into very messy puzzles!</p>\n<p>Video game developed for the Videogame Design and Programming course, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/polimigamecollective<br/>https://twitter.com/polimigc<br/>http://www.polimigamecollective.org<br/>http://polimi-game-collective.itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T06:01:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/01411341c3fcda98eeb37f8288611adc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
