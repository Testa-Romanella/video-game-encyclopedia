Goal of the game is to feed all the creatures called Gizmos in a level.. Gizmos can control objects but they cant bring it towards them... That means <strong>what you see is not you get</strong> ... so Gizmos should work as a team to feed each other in the game... Feel really free to press the restart button if the game got stuck into any bugs....</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T05:45:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/481/4817ddbc1e036e03c8522c78abb9ba2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rk@0307"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
