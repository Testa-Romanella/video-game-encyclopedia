I\u00a0guess difficult for ya.</li><li><strong>Murilo (ThornDuck)</strong>:\u00a0Made it pixel-art. I\u00a0also stick Z for Zelda in front of Guitar and that's the title of the game.</li></ul>\n<p>In this game, I\u00a0tried to make a top-down pixel-art style game. The spike move along with the\u00a0music tempo. The last few levels are really difficult, but you can past them if you move at the beat of the music, you can pass them.</p>\n<p>Please vote!</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/secret-santa-jam-2022/rate/1845837<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to unlock medals, the game is\u00a0also available on Newgrounds:</p>\n<p>Zitar on Newgrounds</p>\n<p>______</p>\n<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> I\u00a0spent a stupid amount of time trying to adjust my\u00a0frame rate so that it matches the beat of the song being played. Was it worth it?</p>\n<p>(spoiler:\u00a0no it was NOT!)</p>\n<p>I\u00a0found out later I\u00a0could just dump my mp3 into\u00a0https://vocalremover.org/key-bpm-finder\u00a0and it calculates it for me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T08:56:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b2437bcb5cf8e493590885b4f075dd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jack Le Hamster"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
