After dedicating his whole life to studying magic, in the hopes of fulfilling his dream, he finally finds a way to do it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, in order to become a mage, he must first win a deadly free-for-all tournament against the most powerful mages in the world. The story of Magium starts at the beginning of the tournament, right after Barry and all the other participants are transported to the continent where the contest is taking place. The tournament takes place on a continent hidden from the rest of the world, where there are mythical creatures like dragons and hydras, but also remnants of an old and technologically advanced civilization, whose magically powered devices are still being used in the present day.</p>\n\n<p>As the series progresses, Barry will meet with other participants, he will make friends and enemies, and he will gradually find out more about the continent he is on, and its inhabitants. He will find out that a person called \"The Creator\" had established several utopias in this place, six hundred years ago, where animals and humans lived in harmony, and food was created through magic.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>What Barry will get to see through his travels, however, is the downfall of these utopias, some of them being on the brink of destruction. As he begins to get involved with the people of this land, Barry will need to decide if he can simply ignore what is happening before his eyes, or if he will intervene, at the risk of being banned from the tournament, and forfeiting his dream.Credits for the magic ball image on the cover go to Agnes Landgraf.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I've rebuilt the first chapter of the popular text-based CHYOA game 'Magium the Mage Tournament' on Unity.\u00a0 If you like the 1st chapter you can download Magium on the Appstore.</p>\n\n<p>Full credit to the author.\u00a0 (Chris Micheal Wilson)</p>\n<p>Credit to Reddit user r/slavic rabbit for his illustration of Barry.</p>\n\n<p>As of right now, I haven't coded in an option to save or load the game.
