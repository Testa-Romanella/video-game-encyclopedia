If you wait too long, the turn ends automatically, which can leave you vulnerable to enemy attacks. Use the cards in your hand wisely (sometimes wasting them for a chance of drawing a better one).\u00a0\u00a0Empty your hand to beat the game.</p>\n<p>Use the mouse and left click to control everything in the game. Click the clock to skip the waiting phase of the turn.</p>\n<p>This game was made very quickly for the jam and likely has flaws and bugs, so please treat this more like a proof of concept. Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T20:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ff50b8b4c616a09a9974e336a09bd18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Klardonics"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
