The world that surrounds him is one where robots simply follow their programming and do not make decisions for themselves, so as he explores the very same building he was created in our little robot seeks to find himself and discover his passion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We have very much enjoyed this Game Jam experience. With our core game development team consisting of only four members, all of us in one way or another had a hand in each and every aspect of the game. Our three additional members who helped throw ideas our way we were very grateful for in this process as well. This was our first Game Jam, so we look forward to improving our skills and developing better games in the future.</p>\n\n<p>\r\nStory by Tiffany Taylor</p>\n<p>Music\r\nby Andy Hamilton</p>\n<p>Art\r\nby Macy Hamilton</p>\n<p>Unity\r\nDesign/Programming by Chris Norman</p>\n<p>Special\r\nThanks: Claire, Lucas, Greg, and La Rae (thanks for your awesome\r\ncooking/support)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c346b6509878fb96eec83a82fd6c98b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SydiousMax"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
