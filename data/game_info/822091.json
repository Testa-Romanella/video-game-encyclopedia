Feel like it's a major step up from my games for previous jams.\u00a0 There may be some bugs, as again made within 48 hours and me being urged to actually sleep like a normal person, but it should hopefully be enjoyable!</p>\n<p>Credits for Externally Used Assets:<br/>Sound: Freesound.org (All Creative Commons 0)<br/>Music:\u00a0Something I Like (instrumental) \u2013 RYYZN (No Copyright Music)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ff/5ff66237b3436a2ab1f78bc903e2bdc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shadow The Dragon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
