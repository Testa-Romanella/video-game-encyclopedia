It was developed as a response to \u201crival\u201d Year 10 students wanting to battle for glory during a lunchtime games club. This game has undergone rigorous testing both during class time \u201ctraining sessions\u201d and most recently in our first weekly lunchtime activity.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The initial inspiration for the games theme was to be purely a Team Based experience set in a cyberpunk environment. This has somewhat changed over the course of development with the addition of a military style arena, along with the addition of extra game modes. Game modes included are:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Team Death Match\r\n  </li><li>Free-For-All\r\n  </li><li>Capture the Flag\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is by no means a fully polished experience,\u00a0 and is currently only setup to play via local network (I have not tested any other setup)\u00a0however the game runs extremely well. Cyberpunk Shootout was developed using Unreal Engine 5.\u00a0 Any feedback or suggestions are most welcome!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T18:32:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c54/c54587b37a16db7fc4689874e0afb9fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hey Sir indie dev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
