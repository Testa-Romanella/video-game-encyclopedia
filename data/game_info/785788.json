This may occur by an accident in most cases, but when it happens, you end up there. The Backrooms are a seemingly infinite non-linear space.<br/>All rooms in Level 0 appear uniform and share superficial features such as yellowed wallpaper, damp carpeting, electrical outlets, and inconsistently placed fluorescent lighting. However, no two rooms within the level are identical.<br/>Linear space in Level 0 is altered drastically; it is possible to walk in a straight line and return to the starting point, and end up in a completely different set of rooms than the ones previously passed through.<br/><br/>That was a myth for long, but now scientists discovered a new way of entering. They have made a lot of experiments and now they can say entering is totally safe and easy. They are having scientists there with experimenting motive and now looking for civil people to send in. <br/>They are really friendly and respecting your needs. Then you get sent into the backrooms and find yourself alone.<br/>Where are the others?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore the Backrooms with a Camera and a Pedometer.<br/>Don\u2019t try to memorize the rooms or where you came from, this is the Backrooms.<br/><br/>You are alone and these yellow walls and that sound of the lamps starting to drive you crazy. You hate that weird feeling you get there.<br/>Are you sure you are alone? Is it just your mind?<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-22T13:50:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b65/b65f818fdf0b04099e42054e8ba879cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 504, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["alien299 | Patrik Nagy", "Patrik Nagy - alien299"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Patrik Nagy - alien299"], "esrb_rating": null}
