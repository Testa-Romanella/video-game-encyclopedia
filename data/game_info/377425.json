A blacksmith who took to the forge to fight their blight bite as a knight.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps you trust the Veteran armed with his old rifle and wits, he's headed out to the pits to blow these zombies to bits.</p>\n<p>Not all heroes have hearts of gold. The Gangster just got a shipment of brand new submachine guns from the port! He's taking to the world court without escort to cut short these monsters plans. After all, you can't extort a dead city.</p>\n<p>Lastly, this diner dame may just be a Waitress, but a girls gotta have some skills to keep the wolves away.
