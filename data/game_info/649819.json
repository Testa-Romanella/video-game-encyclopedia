When the opponents touch the wall, they go down the board. Unlike other games we don't get points for killing opponents, but for leaving as many walls as possible at the end of each wave.</p>\n<p>With each wave more and more enemies come out.</p>\n<p>Every 5 waves special enemies come out, which after death do not leave walls and on contact with a wall, destroy it.</p>\n<p>The game ends, when the opponents reach the bottom of the board.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Mouse - move<br/></p>\n<p>- LMB - shoot<br/></p><p> - F1 - full screen (only in desktop version)</p><p>\r\n     - Esc - return to menu </p>\n<p>If you are interested, the sounds (including music) are from freesounds.org . \r\n    </p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, let me know about them. \r\n    </p>\n<p>Good luck :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T06:28:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9c/a9cd6df20ecc6b6ecd5bd03253fb5218.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kasztan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
