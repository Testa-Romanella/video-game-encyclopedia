After many years of research, we developed DMDJ, a unique sophisticated application that enables you to create perfect atmospheres for your RPG and Tabletop Game Sessions, using environmental soundscapes, sound effects, music tracks and makes your life easier with a unique dice rolling system.<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT ANOTHER LOOP PLAYER LIKE THE ONES EVERYBODY USES<br/><br/>When a soundscape is played in DMDJ, it is not just a recording. A lot is happening under the hood. A soundscape consists of over ten tracks playing simultaneously various environmental noises and sound FX, and a continuous randomized engine of sound processing elements. This makes every soundscape you hear, unique and new every time you play it.<br/><br/>** Your session will never get boring by repeated patterns of sounds or loops. There isn't another application in the world doing this. We created magic for you! **<br/><br/>DMDJ features extensive (and very expensive) content, containing Hi-End Sound FX also used in Hollywood movies and famous games. And to spoil you, we added a vast collection of music tracks from professional composers.<br/><br/>DMDJ at the moment ships with 100 soundscapes, complete with day/night selection and 3 different intensity levels each (low, medium, high), more than 140 randomized sound FX (more than 1000 sounds) for you to use to boost your storytelling, an excellent collection of weather presets (also continuously randomized) that play on top of all soundscapes, adjustable automatically depending on the setting (indoor, outdoor etc.), and finally, more than 100 music tracks covering all relevant genres, to build tension, emotion and grandiosity.<br/><br/>And wait! There\u2019s more!<br/><br/>DMDJ is equipped with a powerful and advanced dice system that can be completely customized to your needs. Even the most complicated dice throw is one touch away while you can trust our randomly generated results, just like the real dice, or make your custom weighted die to favor a situation.<br/><br/>In DMDJ you can use \u2018Snapshots\u2019 in order to save a list of presets of your favorite settings and then access them intuitively via a direct menu. That way you can prepare your scenario according to your storyline and focus more on storytelling.<br/><br/>DMDJ is compliant with the latest specifications (EBU R128/CALM Act) to ensure the best acoustic experience and no negative psychological impacts for the users.<br/><br/>A dedicated team of sound designers will update the content over time, feeding your imagination and help you create beautiful stories to amaze your party.<br/><br/>Just plug your device to your Hi-Fi system, home theater or TV set and transform your room into a fantasy land. <br/>With DMDJ, your adventures come alive.<br/><br/>Review quotes:<br/><br/>\"Within seconds of downloading, I constructed a soundscape consisting of a crowded city street with imperial horns for music accompaniment. Color me surprised at the quality of the music that comes with DMDJ; I typically expect default music to be the musical equivalent of clip art, but this is not the case.\"<br/>critical-hits.com<br/><br/>\"DMDJ is the best solution I've found for engaging my table's senses to another level and the proof is in the pudding. The same players who thought music was distracting when I've used it in the past came to the table last week asking, 'What, we're not going to have music this week?'\u2026and so DMDJ became a regular feature at my table.\"<br/>rpgmusings.com<br/><br/>\"I like DMDJ a lot. It's easy to use, offers a lot of bang for the buck and might be a great app to add that additional oomph to your games.\"<br/>stargazersworld.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c7/3c7dedb133932d2aa7e24a370ca2ceae.jpg", "website": "http://www.bluefacegames.com/applications/dmdj", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Blueface Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Panagiotis Kouvelis"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
