Slipstream behind opponents, then tackle them out of the way to overtake. Push your car to the max, but be careful not to hit those curves at too high a speed. <br/><br/>Unlock twenty unique cars in four different classes (oldies, heavies, supercars and racers) and customize them with paintjobs and stickers. <br/><br/>Challenge other slotcar fanatics and rise through the ranking list, or fight for a top spot on the leaderboards!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/421/421594f898b1cd4be8cd3468721835da.jpg", "website": "http://www.polarbit.com/our-games/rail-racing/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Polarbit"], "genres": ["Racing", "Family"], "publishers": ["Polarbit"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
