However, they can make choices to determine the story's route and the ending. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure book, except in a game (and with art and sound!).</p>\n<p><em>What's a BL game?</em></p>\n<p>A BL game is a boy's love game - a game that focuses on a relationship between two males. </p>\n<p><em>Which version should I get?</em></p>\n<p>On this page you will find both the full releases of the game and the demo version, which is free. We also have support for Windows, Mac, and Linux -- just download the appropriate version for your system. Also, please note the rating of the version you download.</p><p><em>Why did we make this game?</em><br/></p><p>A lot of our inspiration comes from the popular\u00a0Nitro+CHiRAL\u00a0games (namely, Togainu no Chi and Lamento: Beyond the Void), as well as a fantastic doujinshi VN, Cage -Open-. We wanted to present the BL visual novel community with our own take on the genre, and we aim to create an experience that will be unlike any other.<br/></p>\n<p><em>How does the itch.io version work?</em></p>\n<p>On the purchases/download page of the game, you will have the ability to download every version available (PC/Mac/Linux, PG-13/R-18). You will also have the ability to redeem a Steam key.</p>\n<p>Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/dQ8pHZL.png </p>\n<p><em>How does the Steam version work?</em><br/></p>\n<p>The Steam game is the PG-13 version of Requiescence. Every Steam purchase includes an itch.io key so that you have access to the DRM-free R-18 version as well. </p>\n<p>Windows: Right click the game in your Steam library. Select \"View CD Key\". Copy to clipboard (it will copy the long argent-games.itch.io/etc. link). Paste into web browser of your choice.
