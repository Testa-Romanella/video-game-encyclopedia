In the same way people became afraid and the knights decided to start investigating the case. One day they discovered who the culprit was, that it was Count Dracula who lived in the vicinity of the town and that he was in fact a vampire, and they decided to finish him off, but failed miserably before his powers, and the killing continued. It was then that word of a vampire spread throughout the kingdom, and so the vampire hunters joined the cause. The search for the head of the terrible and powerful count continues until then.</p>\n<p>At night you can defend yourself against humans with your bare hands, while during the day you stay hidden in the coffin so as not to be exposed to the light, leaving all the work to the traps. New types of enemies will also appear to face, including the hero. You can use souls to buy traps and improve them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T14:59:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ff/8ff6077db120553306cee33cc4d5c4ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["suansilva"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
