{"id": 257179, "slug": "cross-fire-1990", "name": "Cross Fire (1990)", "name_original": "Cross Fire (1990)", "description": "<p>CrossFire is a side-scrolling run-and-gun somewhat reminiscent of Contra series, although played at a slower pace. All that is known about the plot is that you are Eric the soldier and you single-handedly fight evil all over the world, from Vietnam to Colombia. You start with your fists and grenades, but soon obtain a sub-machine gun which can be upgraded to spread shot and even to rocket launcher. The upgrades are usually located in breakable crates. Unlike most Contra games, Eric doesn&#39;t die in a single hit, but has a lifebar which is partially replenished or extended every time he picks up a weapon upgrade or a medal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-11T19:37:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a88/a880cfd0af488f24e17a4ad2a2da007f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Sanritsu Denki"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Kyugo"], "esrb_rating": null}
