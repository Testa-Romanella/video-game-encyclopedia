All the game is right now is a fancy jumpscare simulator, so don't expect too much from this game</p>\n<p>Some of you may notice the striking resemblance to an indie horror game named \"It Steals\". Well, believe it or not, I had never heard of this game until my friend pointed out how similar our games are to each other (We even both use the pixelation effect on the camera!). So if you enjoy this little proof of concept, and are eager for more, go give It Steals a try</p>\n<p>Despite the similarities to It Steals, I'm hoping that, with a bit more hard work, I can still produce a great horror experience that has enough backbone to stand on its own two feet, and not just be known as the \"It Steals\u00a0Clone\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T10:05:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5f/f5f4ea4fc6184561f8f334f37766676b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Bobby Shmurner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
