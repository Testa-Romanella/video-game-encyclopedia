Gossip is frequently spoken about as frivolous or destructive. While this can be true, gossip is also an integral connective tissue of community. It\u2019s a treasured ritual that enables us to talk about the intricacies of our complex lives, both as individuals and as people in collective relationships. Gossip can be a loving expression of affection for a certain person, event, or time. It can undermine or threaten, and it it can be humorous, incisive, and insightful.\r\n</p>\n<p>Gossip provides an opening to dabble in shaping a wider world. It calls into question the specifics of place and time, of people and institutions, and of small everyday matters. The act of gossip builds the world around us even as it occurs in response to that same world.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is an attempt to think about the purpose and impacts of gossip and the ways in which it shapes our worlds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T12:58:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af6/af68cd4c54fa2746295eaf91b120880c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oak Grove Games by Esther Wallace"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
