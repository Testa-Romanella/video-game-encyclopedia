I wasn't able to commit the full 48-hrs sadly and so I had to cut a lot of content. Not least of all sound. Normally I'd cram something janky in last-minute, but couldn't manage it this time. I definitely like where this is going and will do a version 2 with some of the more 'Nice-To-Haves' in there.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T06:19:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42d/42d9f064a74668c70a2fe68a90e91939.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Haustgeirr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
