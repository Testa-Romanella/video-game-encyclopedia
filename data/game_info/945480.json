{"id": 945480, "slug": "suicideking", "name": "SuicideKing", "name_original": "SuicideKing", "description": "<p>- In this game, you play as the strongest king. As the king, you are one of the most powerful rulers among all the countries, and you are no longer interested in always winning. Therefore, you decide to \"somehow\" prevent your units from winning. The game will end once all of your units are dead (still in development).<br/></p>\n<p><em> </em><br/></p>Future plans:\r\n\n<p>I am planning to add more units to the game, as well as more territories for the player to attack. Additionally, I would like to add some events that will allow the player to \"help ally units ;)\" their units (I am already working on one event). I also want to add more sound effects to the game and some more animations like battle animations...</p>\r\nIn the game:\r\nIn menu:\r\n<p>- You can click on buttons or using WASD and SPACE  to play the game but beware of these buttons: \"Credits, Load\". They are still in development. In credits you can see authors but only those buttons where you can move with WASD.</p>\r\nIn game:\r\n<p>- You can move the camera by moving mouse to the edge of screen or by WASD.</p>\n<p>- You can also earn money by fighting others units in World. The <strong>red country</strong> is your Kingdom. <br/></p>\n<p>- You can spend the money in Suspicious shop and reduce your units hp (In future this will be important because of this you will be able to lost units easier)</p>\r\nSupporting:\r\n<p>- Well I know this game is still in development but I need your feedback to find out whether I should continue creating this game or not so feel free to support me on <strong>buy me a coffe</strong> and commenting this game, I will be thankful: <em>https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dontjirka</em><em>.</em></p>\n\n<p>\n<em>- </em>Also feel free to support the other people which I have got music from, sound effect etc. For more info see <strong>LICENSE.txt</strong> in SuicideKing.zip</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T08:47:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ca/1cafbf1c2ff3185ee98a5ed55c0a52ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dontjirka"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
