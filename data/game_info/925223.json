This also works with arrow keys. You can also press space to create a copy, which respawns you, and creates a copy of you which perfroms exactly the actions you did.</p>\n<p>Sorry this game's kinda short, I was gonna add several levels, but I ended up spending way to long messing arround with shaders and the glow effect, so I ran out of time. Honestly still not too happy with how it looks, but it's good enough for 3 hours work.</p>\n<p>Have fun :)<br/></p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<p>- The copies can push you around, and bonk you through the world if they jump on you. This is because I implemented the copies in the stupidest possible way.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T05:05:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41f/41f81b31e9df48f475b71c529593034a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jade_duck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
