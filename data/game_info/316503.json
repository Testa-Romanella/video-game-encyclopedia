Not the crazy or risk-taking type, but the kind that sits in a bright white lab and stares into microscopes. But this life doesn\u2019t last forever.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>A meteorite landed a few miles away from the science labs, and there were samples taken from it. The scientists on the floor above you started a new project, Project X, and you started to get curious. Is Project X related to the meteorite? Your friend Daniel told you the new project isn\u2019t anything too important, but you\u2019ve heard the whispers: aliens.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Desperate to make an exciting discovery, you begin to explore the labs where Project X began. The labs are strangely empty, leaving you to piece together what has happened from stray research notes. Find all the notes, and figure out what\u2019s going on upstairs. Are the rumors true? What exactly is going on with Project X?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51f/51f64df4c2312421b8d3e9e8292a059c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Juliette Amorati"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
