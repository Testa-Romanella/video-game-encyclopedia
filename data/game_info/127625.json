The game is short but has tons of replay-ability due to the amount of different paths you can take. The scoring system will also compel you to try again for higher scores.</p><p>This game supports x-input pads. The controls are rather self-explanatory, but if you need help be sure to read the readme included in the zip file.</p><p>I hope you enjoy!<br/></p><p>- Buy &amp; Stream the Soundtrack Here! -<br/></p><p>Contact: Twitter - ashton.bahnmiller@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2b/a2b03e4f6c82246dd09ccb736fcd0a79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lethargic in the Park"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
