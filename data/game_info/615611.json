I did not have the full time frame that was available to work on this as I was in another jam but with the remaining time I was able to finish this frogger replica like game before the deadline and I'm pretty impressed with how it turned out. The game is \"finished\" but I could easily create some more levels with a little more time on hand. Perfect jam to get this game wrapped up and the minimal requirements made it easy for a beginner like myself. Thanks again to everyone who participated and played and I would love any kind of feedback in relation to this project!</p>\r\nUpdate Notes\r\n<p>v2.0 - In Development\r\n</p>\n<p>Developed In Unity 2020.2.2f1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T06:50:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60c/60c720375c88816b5057bfee74827e8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Mitchell Todd"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
