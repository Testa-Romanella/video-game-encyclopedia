{"id": 754924, "slug": "scorpion-overdrive", "name": "Scorpion Overdrive", "name_original": "Scorpion Overdrive", "description": "In Scorpion Overdrive you play as a space pirate that is stealing the galaxy\u2019s most valuable resource from the corporate controlled planet Torsun. As you travel the wild and dangerous fringes of the planet, your job is to commandeer the equipment that pumps that valuable liquid (known simply as \u2018juice\u2019) from the ponds that litter the dark planet, and rocket it into orbit where your crew waits above you in the collection ship to collect it all.<br/><br/>Once the equipment is running and the juice is flowing, you\u2019ll be met with a merciless wall of resistance as hordes of giant alien bugs sting, stab, claw and shock you to no end. The hordes will keep coming harder as they reinforce their resistance to your presence on their planet and do everything in their power to destroy the pumping station.  If you manage to keep the equipment alive, you\u2019ll earn a nice payday that you can use to outfit yourself with some sweet weapons upgrades and other goodies along the way.<h3>Single-player Campaign</h3><br/>Scorpion Overdrive features a full campaign of missions set in different regions of the planet. As you collect the resources of a region, new regions will become available, with new enemy creatures and new challenges. The campaign is designed to be cycled through indefinitely and each mission will progress through several levels of difficulty when revisited. As you play through the campaign cycle you'll gain more weapons, traps, equipment, and abilities to tear through these increasing hordes.<h3>Upcoming Mode Additions</h3>It is currently a single-player campaign, however, there are several modes that are being planned for addition, including online co-op, a rogue lite-'ish' mode where unlocks happen much faster but are lost on character death, etc., based on player feedback and community response.<h3>Weapons and Abilities</h3><br/>An array of weapons, turrets, and traps are made available as you fight your way through the strange lands of Torsun. The variety of ways to eviscerate enemies of all kinds the key to enjoying your time in this terrible corner of the galaxy. Combining weapon types to achieve the perfect killing style is what it\u2019s all about.<br/><br/>Abilities are usable in card type system where 3 abilities may be activated at any one time. The combination of abilities that you choose to deploy with will based on your preferred method of dealing with the hordes. Be efficient and beef up your turrets and traps, or get messy and use some personal abilities, it\u2019s up to you.<h3>Endless Hordes</h3><br/>The mission base features a training area that provides an endless swarm of increasing intensity to learn and perfect your skills before heading out into the wild, like perfecting the art of exploding giant crabs by having a rocket turret land on them, or popping off a plasma cannon on a monster scorpions head. It\u2019s also a relaxing place to have an enemy creature chew on your face or have a giant alien scorpion shock you back to reality on a lazy Sunday afternoon.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T03:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ac/1aca9c42f5053187e2c588f886797ea3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 467, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Outer Reef Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Outer Reef Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
