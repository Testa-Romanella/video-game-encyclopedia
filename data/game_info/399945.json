Tales of the Cold Land", "description": "Welcome to Mirt, a land lost in the northern valleys and lost in time. As a newcomer, you must face the difficulties of people not being keen to welcome you, and snow in the summer, and the extensive secrets of Mirt's small history.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnton is an ordinary student. Not having enough money, he decides to go to Mirt for the summer. The beginning of his stay is relaxing but fairly uneventful: easy but well-paid work, a small room, and new friends. But soon the Mirt's past begins to show itself and Anton has to become a detective for a while to figure out what's going on. Can a girl from a cafe see the future? What made a young woman commit suicide? Who or what did kill the new arrivals some years ago? And, last but now least, why did his shadow suddenly become a few shades brighter?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T22:17:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c7/2c703413acbd9fb9c6bd7c82e73ee213.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Emanon Studios", "olivson"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Emanon Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
