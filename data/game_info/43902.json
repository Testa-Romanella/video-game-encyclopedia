{"id": 43902, "slug": "chainman", "name": "ChainMan", "name_original": "ChainMan", "description": "CHAINMAN is a Japanese made VR Survival Horror with strong stealth gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou awake on an island with your arms restrained in chains as blood curdling groans advance on you. With no way to fight back you must use a combination of light mechanics, and the information left by other survivors to traverse the night and stay hidden from the horror that looms in the darkness.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n&gt;Flares are your only distractions. Crates and barrels your only hiding spots.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n&gt;Each enemy has a varied ability to see and hear you. Be careful not to approach some and weary not to shine light on others.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n&gt;You must acquire certain provisions to advance through the island and escape. Predict the enemy's movement and find a route to safety.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n&gt;It takes 2-3 hours to reach the normal ending.<br/>\r\n  Play more for an alternate ending.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBUILD NOTE:<br/>\r\nWe plan to update the CHAINMAN experience by the end of September. We will implement a multiplayer mode in which one player uses the pc and the other uses a VR headset.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs we\u2019re a Japanese studio, please help us to create great VR experiences for all audiences, not only the Japanese. Let us know what we need to consider? The do\u2019s the dont\u2019s, the must haves and wants? We greatly value your feedback and hope to hear your constructive comments.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffa/ffa6923eede3b08561c5a4b7f5bd1fc9.jpg", "website": "https://www.oukaichimon.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ouka-ichi-mon.inc"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ouka-ichi-mon.inc"], "esrb_rating": null}
