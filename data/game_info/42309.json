Your &quot;base&quot; is a car with a turret, in its body you store the collected things. Collect everything you need - this is a victory.<br />\nFirearms are hard to find. You have to use unusual objects, fists and legs. Weapons can be improved, for this, you can find drawings and materials.<br />\nYou can upgrade almost everything: account, hero, weapons and even a workshop. Killing enemies, you raise the level and improve skills - to a certain level. In the next battle, you will start all over again, the achievements will not be preserved.<br />\nValuable things fall out of almost all opponents, but the most valuable can be taken for the capture or defense of &quot;checkpoints&quot;. You can also steal resources from an enemy base.\u2028\u2028Funny moment - if you collect a lot of things, the movement becomes more difficult and slower.<br />\nThere are many tactical options in the game.
