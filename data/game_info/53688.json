It was later ported to the NES, developed by Micronics. Conversions were done also for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC in 1987 by Ocean Software under their Imagine label. However, only the NES version was released for North American homes until the PlayStation Network saw a release of the arcade original in 2011. The game&#39;s protagonist, Princess Athena, has gone on to appear in later fighting games by SNK as a secret character or assistant to her descendant Athena Asamiya, a frequent main character in these games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a9b/a9b15cf788936b50e221380d5252ed93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "NES"], "developers": ["SNK", "Micronics"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["SNK"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
