This was created in 48 hours from scratch by one guy so pardon the rough edges. I'm a developer by trade so this was a great excuse for me to work on my art skills. I had a lot of fun making this but I unfortunately ran out of time and so this game is clearly unfinished. I encourage you to download it, try it out and let me know what you think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T15:26:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d4/8d43bb8919e58fba1d0c597b339f5f22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimmothySanchez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
