{"id": 858855, "slug": "wild-defense", "name": "Wild Defense", "name_original": "Wild Defense", "description": "<p>Wild Defense is an isometric map with a monster\u00a0wave survival game where the player needs to defend his hut from the forest animals that want to eat his food. In order for the player to survive during his summer vacation, he must build barriers and traps around his tent and thus counter all threats. This game is a mix of Tower Defense with crafting for defense improvements. The player has time to prepare for the waves of monsters, where in the meantime he can repair and/or build new defenses to survive another day. The monsters don't come from a lined-up direction like Tower Defence, but they can come from any direction and attack your tent.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T14:33:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de36ed3eef890f9f65de5cc5e5e34806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joerverson Santos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
