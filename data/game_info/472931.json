I just wanted to say thank you all for your patience, and that the game will be continuously updated as development continues. Characters, the world, game mechanics and more may all get changed, updated, or even removed as time and development goes on. This is currently only the game's\u00a0<strong>PROLOGUE</strong>, but more chapters to the story are in development. Thank you for your patience and support!</p>\n\r\n\r\nHEY, COME SEE OUR VISUAL NOVEL SPINOFF!\r\n<p>Join Ruth and Anise on a sleepover with Marsh at HYADES: Celestial Buddies Volume 1!</p>\n<p>https://majimjam.itch.io/hyadescelestialbuddiesvol1<br/></p>\n\r\nCONTACT\r\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/HYADESRPG<br/>Email: hyadesrpg@gmail.com</p>\n\r\nWARNING: IF YOU CAN'T SAVE, AND ARE PLAYING ON MAC...\r\n<p>Fellow Mac users! If you encounter a message that looks something like this...</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Move your HYADES folder to the desktop, or somewhere OUT OF YOUR DOWNLOADS FOLDER! The Applications folder works as well!</strong></p>\n<p>The reason why this happens is that the Mac has a fail save to make sure downloaded files can't automatically write potentially malicious things onto your computer! So the Mac likes to make downloaded files have \"Read-Only\" permissions. Since HYADES is trying to\u00a0<strong><em>write\u00a0</em></strong>new information (your save data), the game gets confused! As far as some players have reported, simply moving the game out of the downloads folder or manually changing the permissions allows the game to save. In my experience, moving the game directly out of the folder it came in into the Application folder works. Of course, if this DOESN't work, please feel free to contact me!</p>\r\nWARNING: \"I CAN'T SELECT ANOTHER ENEMY IN BATTLE, IT'S STUCK ON ONE!\"\r\n<p>Don't worry, there's a very simple fix - just move your mouse! HYADES is actually playable with a mouse as well, and the mouse takes priority over keyboard in battle when selecting an enemy! All you need to do is move your mouse past where an enemy is and control from the keyboard should take priority again.</p>\n\r\nThanks for visiting this little game's page, and remember:<br/>Despite your circumstances, do your best.
