We got some bridges to build!<h3>GOTTA RUN FAST</h3>A mysterious void appeared out of nowhere and is swallowing this merry world. Why? Our developers still don\u2019t know or they do, but won\u2019t tell us. It is what it is. Your concern for now is to get as far away from it as you can!<h3>ANIMALS TOGETHER STRONG</h3>Friends is the best thing one can have. That is if you don\u2019t yet have this game. And if you do have it the next best thing you can do now is play it with up to 4 people. Carry heavy items together, arrange all essential resources and help eachother do what is needed to progress in your race. Don't worry if all of your friends are busy, you can play it alone as well.<h3>I LIKE BRIDGES</h3>It really doesn\u2019t matter that you skipped your civil engineering 101 class at school (was there even one?). <br/>You\u2019ll figure out how to build bridges in no time. Keep in mind that a simple wooden bridge may not always hold though, better nail it!<h3>THE MIGHTY OMNOMNATOR</h3>The name of this fine piece of machinery and pinnacle of engineering says it all. Give it some tree, let the OMNOMNOM happen and get started with your bridge. Need some nails for heavy duty stuff? Find some rocks, treat them with that OMNOMNOM and there you go.<h3>LEARNING IS A LIFELONG JOURNEY</h3>You'll choose which skills to learn with time to be better equipped to handle all adversities thrown at you. Hope you'll also learn from your mistakes.<h3>MR WORLDWIDE</h3>Always wanted to travel the world? Well, now you have no other choice, so might as well enjoy it. You start out in the forest, but who knows where this adventure will lead you?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T04:14:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7a/f7a9db8cf6df6ff2a11a2779daa5603f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["New Exception Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["New Exception Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
