These robot kitties have a special attraction to bonsai, since they think it's robot catnip! His objective is to recover them without changing the timeline, trying to keep everything intact with his trusted holo-orb. With this old orb he can water the bonsai back to health, point the bots back to his time capsule with a laser, or even shoot down the time police that came to put an end to this whole mess.</p>\n<p>This project was developed in two weeks, as a part of programming classes back in March 2020, being the first 3D game I've ever made.</p>\n<p>I worked on the game and level design, and C# coding.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77e12b7b1125207a0341290924442aa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fl\u00e1vio Abreu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
