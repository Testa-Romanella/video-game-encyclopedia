These 'weeping angels' (unskinned at the moment) have never been seen moving, and some believe they are simply statues. However, they only move in the <strong>dark</strong>, hunting for their next prey (which happens to be you). You are armed only with a torch, which runs out of battery quickly and must be regularly recharged. Can you navigate the hallways of this laboratory and escape with your life?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/573/573f9d121cb2e0c663f11cc52ea525a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kerds78"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
