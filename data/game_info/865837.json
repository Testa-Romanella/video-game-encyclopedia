Featuring genre staples such as manual saves, interactive puzzles, and grotesque monsters to blast, Transmission: Kill harkens back to a simpler era of atmospheric horror.<br/></p>\n<p>Stranded and wounded on a forgotten planet somewhere in the\u00a0Triangulum Galaxy, you find yourself in front of an old alien power substation. But what lurks inside is more dangerous than any enemy you've encountered before. As a genre fusion between \"Metroidvania\" and \"Survival Horror\", you'll jump, shoot, and use your wits to survive. Blast enemies with three different weapons, solve various puzzles, and scavenge for items as you attempt to escape the horrors inside the substation.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>3 <strong>weapons</strong> to collect</li><li>5 <strong>areas</strong> to explore</li><li>Various <strong>puzzles</strong> to solve and <strong>clues</strong> to find</li><li>Manual saving</li><li>Scarce supplies make for a difficult adventure</li><li>45mins-1hr\u00a0play-time for first time play through</li><li>Time recorded at the end of each playthrough!
