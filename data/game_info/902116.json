The process is very easy. <strong>Just contact me with an official-sounding letter that would sound to an\r\n    outsider as if it's threatening legal action</strong>. Of course, when you submit such a letter, you'll know that that's not\r\n    really what you're requesting - it'll be our little secret!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    That being said, the law is the cornerstone of our great society, and I fully intend to respect it. As such, if you\r\n    are a lawyer representing Elon Musk and <em>would</em> like to inform me that you or Mr. Musk wants content within\r\n    <em>You Are A Tesla</em> changed, I have a procedure in place as well. <strong>Please submit any legitimate legal notices\r\n    in \"uwu-speak\"</strong>. If you are unfamiliar with this manner of communication, you can find a translator here:\r\n    https://uwuifier.com. Any communications not sent in \"uwu-speak\" will be\r\n    interpreted as an encoded request to be featured in <em>You Are A Tesla</em> as described above.
