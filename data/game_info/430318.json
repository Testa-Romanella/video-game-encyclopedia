{"id": 430318, "slug": "seconds-in-space", "name": "Seconds in Space", "name_original": "Seconds in Space", "description": "<strong>Overview</strong><br/>Use ships to attack and destroy enemy space stations in real time. Navigate through different randomly setup star maps to get to the exit and win. It's a 2D single player space game that's massively replayable. Every playthrough is winnable but feel free to blame the game if you lose, your friends will never believe you though.<br/><br/><ul><li>Massively replayable<br/>Units have lots of depth and are well play tested for every correct move and mistake. No matter how many times you play you'll always have fun and feel dumb for making simple mistakes. The star maps have fixed layouts but the rewards and exit point are in randomized locations. This means that no matter how many times you play they'll always feel like new.<br/><br/></li><li>Wide range of difficulty levels<br/>Want to relax after a long day or every single move to matter as you push your ships to their limits? Regardless of your mood or skill, you'll find what you're looking for.<br/><br/></li><li>Short playthroughs<br/>Playthroughs are about 0-15 minutes, so don't worry if you don't have a lot of time. The game's easy to get into and about building and trying to maintain good habits.</li></ul><br/><br/><strong>Combat</strong><br/>Use ships to attack and destroy turrets on enemy space stations in real time. You'll quickly learn where to position each ship, when to attack what turret and how to counter their abilities. It's easy to learn but hard to master.<br/><br/><ul><li>Only enemy turrets have abilities<br/>Your ships positioning matters more than ever. Dodge projectiles of different speeds, sizes and negative effects. Switch what turrets you attack to avoid shields and maximize bonus damage. Move weakened ships to safety as you move stronger ones in to take some hits.<br/><br/></li><li>Low unit count<br/>You only have 6 ships to control and 8 enemy turrets to destroy in each round. You must be very focused on each one and use them as a team. If one will be in trouble soon what are you going to do with the others to help?<br/><br/></li><li>Don't give up<br/>A lot of hard work can be undone in a single round but if you play well you can recover. Don't give up because the difference between victory and defeat is often very close, sometimes just a single move.<br/><br/></li><li>Precise gameplay<br/>Each round starts with new ships and turrets. Therefore the gameplay is exactly as casual or intense as the difficulty selected.<br/><br/></li><li>Exploit the enemy turret AI any way you can<br/>Any move that the game allows is fair play. Once you learn how the enemy turret AI works use any and every move you can to exploit it.</li></ul><br/><br/><strong>Navigation</strong><br/>Navigate through different randomly setup star maps to get to the exit and win. The star maps have fixed layouts but the rewards and exit point are in randomized locations. Some rewards will help you and some will harm you. It's all about finding the exit and getting there as quickly as possible. Sometimes you have to rely on a bit of luck but planning ahead will increase your chances.<br/><br/><ul><li>How to find the exit<br/>Unlock rewards as you navigate the star map or travel to possible exit points directly. Sometimes you'll get lucky and the exit will be revealed to you early, but it can easily get moved. Regardless as to how the star map is setup you can always make it.<br/><br/></li><li>Probabilistic decision making and trade-offs<br/>Most of the star map starts hidden and is discovered as you navigate it. Constantly think about where the exit and rewards might be and how you will change your strategy as you progress. What's the chance that the exit will be at the possible exit point that you're traveling towards?  If it's not there what's the chance that it will get swapped to it?<br/><br/></li><li>Different star map lengths and complexity<br/>Some star maps are shorter and others longer. Some are more straightforward and others more complex. Whether your brain doesn't work anymore after a long day or you're fresh and ready to go you can always have fun.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T03:37:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c30/c300d4f81853eeb8096fda1567b71965.jpg", "website": "https://www.Funneractic.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Funneractic"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Funneractic"], "esrb_rating": null}
