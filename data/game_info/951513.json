However, his reign was cut short when he was overthrown by a treacherous noble who coveted his throne. The old king barely escaped with his life, and he is now on the run, hiding from the assassins sent by the new ruler.\r\n</p>\n<p>The only help the old king has is a young squire, who is loyal and brave, and a small group of guards who have remained loyal to him. The king knows that he cannot outrun his enemies forever, and so he decides to build a stockpile of gold to hire mercenaries who can protect him and help him reclaim his throne.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it, try to survive for 5 minutes and try to accumulate as much Gold as you can</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T21:54:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79f/79f08aee387a778d4ea24dc257e7f49a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["offshiftgamedev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
