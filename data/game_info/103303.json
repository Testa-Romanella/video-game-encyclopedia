{"id": 103303, "slug": "kyro", "name": "Kyro", "name_original": "Kyro", "description": "<p>Kyro is a top-down puzzle game inspired by the Adventures of Lolo series of games, which were enjoyed on the original Nintendo Entertainment System. Each level takes place on a single game screen, and you must get to the yellow doorman to continue to the next level. Note the signs; they hold words of truth and wisdom. They're also Chatty Cathys, so you could just ignore them if you wanted.</p><p>You play Maxalena, a warrior looking for a precious hidden jewel that is said to have been altered with a lost advanced technology from a race long extinct. The gem allows its user to displace themselves to another position instantly.</p><p>Basically, the gem can teleport you after being thrown on the ground. You have to use that to traverse the different puzzles in the game world. Pretty simple.</p><p>I created the game in January to February of 2015 over the course of about 3 weeks. It's #2 in a series of games that I am creating, with each game being created in a short period of time. The label \"Shakecan Games\" indicates the \"content under pressure\" style that I'm approaching development with.<br/></p><p>I probably should put that next to the label itself next time, haha... Oh, well.</p><p>REQUIREMENTS</p><p>The game is fairly light weight. I'm unsure of the requirements in particular for graphics card or CPU, but here's a series of rough guesses for requirements to just run the game alone based on testing:</p><p>- Java Runtime Environment 8 or greater</p><p>- OpenGL 2.0 or greater ready graphics card (basically, if your card can do shaders in modern games, it'll prolly handle this no problem, as there's no shaders in this game)</p><p>- 1 Ghz or greater CPU</p><p>- 256 MB or greater of RAM</p><p>- More of everything! Greater, GREEAAATTTEEEERRRR!!!!</p><p>KNOWN ISSUES</p><p>On Linux, using F4 to go into fullscreen mode doesn't seem to work (at least, on my Linux machine).</p><p>On Linux, You need to use the \"java\" command to start the .jar file if you want to save any settings (starting the game by double-clicking will run it okay, but it will crash if you try to save settings).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2a/a2a1e35d17ba8f6373f744376eb2386c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SolarLune"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
