He wakes up and finds he has\u00a0amnesia and has awoken in a mysterious World. The only thing he remembers is that he is\u00a0searching for his \u201cwaifu\u201d that he vaguely remembers. Thus he begins his search to find\u00a0clues on where the waifu could be.</p>\n<p>During his search, he comes across a Large Gate which is locked by a Special 4 piece<br/>Puzzle. Unsure of what to do he finds routes elsewhere which are all originating from the central point. Taking these paths he encounters obstacles in the forms of puzzles and different characters like Spirits and even glimpses of the Waifu. When he finishes these puzzles he sees something from his memories.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/989/989ac2fc78d2adbd353c0febe678d46c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KDU Glenmarie Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
