In order to keep the administration in your hands, the city needs to develop continuously.<br />\nYour role in this game is to determine where the buildings and structures in the city can be built. Time and moves in the game are turn based. Each move is given random zoning type to mark on the map. After you mark zones, you move on to the next cycle and observe the developments in the city.<br />\nYou can unlock more advanced types of buildings and structures by completing in-game objectives. Completing objectives also allows you to use different map view tools that will make management easier.<br />\nThere are five main types of zones you manage; residential, agricultural, commercial, offices and industrial. You need to constantly try to manage the distance between the zones, the density and the balance between them correctly. Otherwise, escapes from the city may begin, unused buildings may collapse on their own, and the city may collapse with a chain effect.<br />\nThe main aim of the game is to keep the administration in your hands as long as possible by ensuring the continuous development of the city and to reach a high population. Losing control of the city is part of the game and it&#39;s up to you to try again to find the best way to keep the city constantly grow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fb/8fb81ba715e9397610831037c6e893ee.jpg", "website": "https://tunaicgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tunaic Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Tunaic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
