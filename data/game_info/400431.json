Sensors indicate an intricate structure ahead with a peculiar energy signature at the opposite end. This tunnel-like structure is huge and the RVG can easily travel within it so you plunge inside to learn more about the strange energy signature. Once inside you find yourself trapped by the aliens within! You must now blast your way through in order to escape. Can you survive the space tornados, the aliens, and their deadly energy blasts?<br/></p>\n<p>For more on what we offer please visit www.bitmapsoft.co.uk<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T02:23:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b40/b405551384c59363c241ea19725b3218.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bitmap Soft"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
