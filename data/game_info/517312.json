{"id": 517312, "slug": "live-penalty", "name": "Live Penalty", "name_original": "Live Penalty", "description": "<p>Play live against a real-life goalkeeper.<br />\nLive Penalty is an elimination game that lets you score goals against a real human goalkeeper. Over multiple rounds you can influence a real football launcher and beat other gamers to the final round. Only in the very last round do you have full control over the machine and get to interact with your real opponent.</p>\n<p>Challenge others OR play together<br />\n10 rounds - 10 chances - only one final 1on1 experience. A good strategy (and a bit of luck) is necessary to get to the final round and engage with the goalkeeper on a personal level. Beat all the other players or collaborate with them in order to make it to the next round - the choice is yours.</p>\n<p>Collect points and rule the leaderboard<br />\nThe goal is divided into different sections, each representing its respective points. The harder the shot, the more points you get (if you make it to the next round). Only the top gamers in the leaderboard get invited to special events and can unlock other features.</p>\n<p>New talents every month<br />\nWe regularly welcome new goalkeepers to the stage. From young and driven newcomers, to established players all the way to the very best in their field. All athletes and other sports enthusiasts can invite their friends, family and fans and challenge them to score some balls against them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T03:52:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/156/156d6eb4df14be359ee5425f15967a6d.jpg", "website": "https://www.livepenalty.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Live Penalty"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Live Penalty"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
