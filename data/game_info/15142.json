She has detailed knowledge of the workings of Watchtower. And more importantly: of time itself. Yet, she knows nothing of her origins, except that she was meant for a great purpose.<br/><br/><strong>Welcome to Watchtower</strong><br/>In the ruins of a dead world stands the great city of Watchtower. The city has survived for four hundred years, longer than most of its citizens can remember. A few whisper about the time of the great plague; a time when the desperate survivors grew so afraid for their fleshly bodies that they encased themselves in metal ones - bodies that would rust and break down, but never sicken and die. Since then they have waited, counting the days as the city falls into ruin.<br/><br/>Explore the many districts of the city of Watchtower; from the festering, corroded slums of Poisonville to the glittering spires of Crystal Heights. Each rendered in a unique hand-drawn steampunk art style. <br/><br/><strong>Are you ready to enter the world of Watchtower?</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69d/69dd97655d120f2d3ea3ace006c726e3.jpg", "website": "http://www.clockwork-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 36, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 475, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gamesoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gamesoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
