Not a joke. Not a goat, nor a slice of bread. A clock. So what is this, exactly?<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tA minimalistic rhythm game. It puts you in the role of the clock itself to explore the concept of time in a whole new way and offer challenge, relaxation, or plain and simple fun. All that a clock needs to do is to advance precisely once every second. Second, after second, after second, after second\u016f Sounds simple enough? But could YOU take over and do it? Calm down. Relax. Focus on your inner rhythm. Click once a second. Every second. You are the clock. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Silly? Don't dismiss the concept. Try it yourself!</strong><br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tYou can download the DEMO right away. Please vote for this project on Steam Greenlight! Once we pass Greenlight, the full game will be available for purchase ($1) here, and on Steam.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tIMPORTANT: THE DEMO ONLY CONTAINS THE TUTORIAL STAGE AND ONE OF MANY STAGES/PLAY MODES AVAILABLE IN THE GAME. It's purpose is to present you with the game's general feel and gameplay concept, not to show you the scope!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tClock Simulator offers:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>A unique concept of a clock-based rhythm game: you are the clock </li>\n<li>Controls so simple you could play with your eyes closed (and you will probably want to try it, too!) </li>\n<li>A variety of play modes and themes ranging from meditative and relaxing to arcade challenges </li>\n<li>Shareable high scores and stats, so you can compare your timing against your friends </li>\n<li>Mesmerising ambient music and groovy color transitions</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tIn our own words: <br/>\r\n\tOur idea was to explore the concept of time in a whole new way, never seen in a game. It's also a new approach to the theme of rhythm-based games. We wanted to offer challenge, relaxation, and a bit plain and simple fun. Focusing on the passage of time, the arbitrary pulse of our world, can be a very mindful and relaxing experience. The game encourages you to calm down and slow down. You'll probably discover that one second lasts a little bit more than you would've expected. Getting in tune with the universal rhythm of our times is the key to mastering all of the game's different stages. \u2013- Micha\u0142 Marz\u0119cki, the studio lead\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThis is what happens when a programmer asks a rhetorical question: \"Bread simulator? Whatever they will think of next? A clock simulator?\", and two marketing guys jump up and and exclaim \"Yes! Hell yes! That's effing brilliant!\". -- Wojtek Mroczek, one of the marketing guys\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tHey, what do you know, it's actually playable! -- Pawe\u0142 Mi\u0142aszewicz, the programmer\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tFAQ: <br/>\r\n\tQ: What the acual f...? <br/>\r\n\tA: Hey, we had our doubts too, but it turned out to be a really cool game idea. Oh... you mean the pig? It's in the game, too. Playing skip rope against the clock hand. Oink! <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tQ: So, how much do you expect me to pay for a broken virtual clock that needs to be advanced manually every and each second? <br/>\r\n\tA: Will be selling this wonderful piece of digital entertainment and relaxation software in one, for the low, low price of $14.99... $4.99... $1 (or 1\u20ac). <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tQ: What's all this zen-mindfulness-relaxation BS? <br/>\r\n\tA: You can play Clock Simulator like a standard arcade game, trying to get the best score. But you can also enjoy it as a way to slow down, calm yourself, and treat your mind to a couple of minutes of clarity and singletasking. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tQ: OK, say you have me convinced to try it. When will it be out. <br/>\r\n\tA: The game is almost ready, and the most probable scenario is that we will put it on the store as soon as we pass greenlight. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThat's it! Thank you for your time (pun intended). Please try the demo, vote on greenlight and share your thoughts! <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tLove, Kool2Play Team\r\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c29eb7f0e59b20d6c10f8fa7397323b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kool2Play"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
