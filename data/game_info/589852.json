They have employed you, a genetically enhanced soldier, as security from any hostiles. Unfortunately, your skills are needed as a group of hostile aliens have besieged the base and are invading many of the installations. It is up to you to repel the attacking forces and save what is left of this prospective colony.</p>\n<p>The player is a space colonist fighting off invaders from their home base.
