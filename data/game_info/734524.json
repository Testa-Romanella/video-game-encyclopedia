And maybe build some paths for your guests. I suppose some fences wouldn't hurt, now that I think about it.<br/></p>\n<p>At night, you have six turns to draw a randomly selected shape with an animal, path, or a fence. When the day arrives, your guests arrive on any paths connected to a side of the park. Then animals move if they can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before they leave for the night, guests will buy items from your store based on their experience. Next to two different species? Better get a photo book. Have an unobstructed view of a faraway animal? They'll buy binoculars.</p>\n<p>After the 5-day week is over your zoo is complete and your score is the total amount guests spent at your store.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Pan with WASD or arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Select your placement type and draw on the map with your mouse.</p>\n<p>Scrollwheel or Q/E to zoom in and out.</p>\n<p>--\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Post-GGJ Bug Fixes</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Fixed the Binoculars scoring.</p>\n<p>- Fixed issue that caused deleting animals if you started to place a fence over one, and then changed your placement type.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T11:12:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/6181bf96464f767112bc6f509647cb19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tddawson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
