To make matters worse, the only thing you can clearly see above water is a shark fin making circles around the raft! That\u2019s where your adventure begins!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2013 Choose among hundreds of items, tools and weapons to craft<br/>\r\n\u2013 Expand and improve your raft the way you want<br/>\r\n\u2013 Fight off the ferocious shark and other enemies<br/>\r\n\u2013 Complete quests and get great rewards<br/>\r\n\u2013 Explore the islands around you and be ready for anything!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCatch resources and debris with a hook<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLots of essential resources are floating in the water around you. Aim and throw your hook as far as you can to gather them. Barrels and crates contain vital resources such as water and food. Debris and wreckages may be used to build and create many useful upgrades for the raft.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCraft gear and weapons<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou must always be ready to defend yourself and the raft from the shark. The choice of equipment and weapons depends on your play style. Be a heavy melee warrior or an agile hunter \u2014 that\u2019s up to you!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nImprove the raft<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can expand the raft and build up floors to make more space for living. All you need to do is process debris into building materials, create a structure and attach it to the raft. There\u2019s also a lot of upgrades such as nets for catching fish and debris that will make your survival a lot easier.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSail and explore<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOver the course of your voyage, lonely islands will appear around now and then. You can build boat and sail to them for additional resources. Be careful, though: poisonous spiders, huge coconut crabs and other enemies won\u2019t let you explore the island carefree. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nComplete quests<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon\u2019t afraid of being idle \u2014 you\u2019ll always have work to do with plenty of quests. Complete them and get resources and rare items as a reward. Some quests may require additional equipment, tools and weapons, so you better gear up!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f6/0f6eb436d468cfab1c52e8235f2dbd73.jpg", "website": "http://gamesunisoft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UniSoft Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["UniSoft Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
