The theme of the game jam was dimension change, attempt to clone a mechanic from either 2D/3D into 3D/2D respectively. I've attempted to recreate the jumping mechanic found in Jump King. You'll probably get tilted playing this game.<br/></p>\n<p>The 3D model, rigging, animating, programming was all done from scratch using Blender 2.8 and Unity 2019.2.9</p>\n<p>The music was also composed by me on Cakewalk using the Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra patches and Spitfire LABS.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I was planning on making this game browser-friendly but I encountered an issue where the Cinemachine free-look camera lacked the \"free-look\" and had limited X-axis rotation in the browser. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I've uploaded the game as is, and is submitted as a downloadable for the Mix and Game Jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d72/d727dc936425b7de734fcff9bb99dc07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["incer7am"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
