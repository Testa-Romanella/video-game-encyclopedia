(<strong>I</strong>slamic\u00a0<strong>S</strong>tate\u00a0<strong>A</strong>nd\u00a0<strong>S</strong>tuff). They are coming for us. If you don't protect our scientists, we're all gonna die.</p>\n<p>Your mission is to keep those I.S.A.S. suckers at bay. Do anything you need to. Fire a pistol at them. Unleash an RPG rocket at their tanks, drop a nuke on their missile launchers, kill the drivers of the enemy jeeps with your sniper rifle-- it is all your choice. We just need you to hold them off as long as you can. The more the time our scientists get, the more the work they'll be able to complete.</p>\n<p>StickWar 2D is a unique castle-defense game with fun RPG elements and mindblowing action all at once. Play in two locations with a wide range of weapons and enemies: from a pistol to an MG to a goddamn nuke, and from a buyonettor to a military tank to a freakin' nuke carrier. StickWar 2D will blow your pants off for sure!</p>\n<p>===============================================================</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7c11ec3d31d41af14d8903ea22d4659.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Moonwalk Entertainment"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
