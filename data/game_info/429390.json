As the last <em>love's operator</em>, you will have to defend it at all costs. Use your turrets to take them out, but beware: the love energy you use will only affect enemies who are vulnerable to one\u00a0of the existing energies of love. Luckily, each way of channelling love can be distinguished by a representative colour, a clear way for any human being to differentiate it without any problems because who can't distinguish colours. Come on. Don't be ridiculous. There's no such thing as \"person blind to colors\".</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Select the turret you want to control\u00a0<strong>by clicking on the corresponding screen.</strong></li><li>You can differentiate between them by the color of the button or by the color of the guns you see on the screen.</li><li>Move the turret around the center with the<strong>\u00a0A and D buttons.\u00a0</strong></li><li>Enemies can only be damaged by turrets of the same colour.</li><li>The top mini map indicates the situation at all times, both the position of\u00a0your turrets and the enemies approaching the centre.</li><li>Every enemy that reaches the center will be destroyed and will cause damage to the heart. If 5 enemies reach the heart, the game is over.</li></ul><p>Disclaimer: first game and\u00a0made in a week.\u00a0But pew pew!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:30:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b94b29c1a1b5154c099af0eb7d8710d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["McCreps"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
