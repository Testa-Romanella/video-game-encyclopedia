A game all about spreading misinformation and planning your way to victory. Here is a easy guide on how to become the messing master:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Step 1:\u00a0</strong> the movement fase.\u00a0 In this fase it is key to move one of your pawns. You can slay an opponents pawn or just strategically move your own. Whatever you do you can only move 1 pawn a turn.</li><li><strong>Step 2:\u00a0</strong>the ability fase. In this fase you're tasked to select an ability to apply to one of your pawns.\u00a0 Shield will grant immunity for one turn, Switch allows you to switch around the location of 2 of your pawns and Change changes one of your pawns movement options from diagonal to straight and vise versa.</li><li><strong>Step 3:\u00a0</strong>the glitch fase. This fase acts identically to fase 2 with some key differents. In this fase none of the selected abilities will actually be applied however it will be listed in the \"what happend last turn\" log.
