On the way you may find mysterious merchants who sell strange and curious items to aid you on your journey. <br/><br/><strong>Game mechanics</strong><br/>Fight your way through 5 levels containing 4 rooms with random layouts of enemies and objects. Use your sword to defeat your enemies with either a slower heavy attack dealing more damage or a quicker attack dealing less damage. Deflect incoming damage with a well-timed deflect to be able to buy you some time for your next attack.   <br/>If your back is against the wall you can always try to escape with a rechargeable dash to increase the distance between you and the enemy.  <br/>Buy upgrades from the store to modify your sword to be longer for reach, heavier for dealing more damage, more health, faster attack speed or faster dash recharge.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T01:58:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d09d9210f8147e26edd1367d0535808.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drakeven", "Henrik Pira"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Henrik Pira"], "esrb_rating": null}
