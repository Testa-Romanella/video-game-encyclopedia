The purpose of this itch.io page is to collect feedback so that we can improve our game! Please fill out this form to help us improve it!</p>\n<p>Form:\u00a0https://forms.gle/ucQdRC8AYXQ3vqdM7</p>\n\n<p>Game story:</p>\n<p>\u00a0The main protagonist earns his money by scavenging old ruins and collecting valuables from old abandoned buildings. One day he decides to loot an old castle where there are rumours about that there are many hidden treasures hidden between its walls. But that is not the only rumor. It seems that the castle is haunted by strange entities. The ones who enter will never return. The main character is overwhelmed with greed and decides to enter anyway. When getting to a loot room the floor crumbles beneath him and he falls a long way down knocking him down instantly. The main character wakes up in a dungeon, there\u2019s a torch in the room which he takes in order to navigate through the dark corridors and chambers. The main character is not alone, there are many monsters that would like to eat him but they are scared of his light. He notices and needs to keep the torch lit at all costs. He comes across lots of challenges like platforming and puzzle solving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Gameplay:</p>\n<p>\u00a0Navigate through a 2D environment to progress through the game. The player needs to optimize the 2D movement of the main character to do so. The player can also interact with objects in the game. This is very important because the player needs to flip switches and push buttons in order to solve different puzzles. But the most important part is the player's torch. Throughout the map there are different sources where he can reset the torch timer. If the timer runs out the player will get in later levels immediately killed by the monsters. All these elements require the player to think on a timer. It\u2019s up to the player how he handles this.</p>\n<p>Note: it is still very work in progess. There are no checkpoints.<br/></p><p>Note2 : We converted our game to a web build but the changes made by unity made the theme page remove the BG and on other stages the music\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:16:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fe/8feb594aa9779fbe1acce443f632894e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fontys Game Design & Technology", "Jesper1997", "Yanick_K"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
