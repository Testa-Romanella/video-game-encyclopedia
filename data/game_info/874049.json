But we don't want to seem like an idiot, so I guess we stick it out for a bit. Seems like we're just going to have to noodle around in the game's scripts to even play through most of it.</p>\r\nNot In-World Narrative\r\n<p>This is a programming game with a focus on experimentation, and monkeying around in the code. All the game modes, game logic, and levels are all created via my scripting language ulox.</p>\n<p>The in-game Narrator will point you towards the files in streaming assets once you finish the first level.</p>\n<p>In there you will find all the scripts and some in-world narrative readmes that explain and nudge you towards where you might want to experiment.</p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>For working with scripts, try using Visual Studio Code. It'll make it easy to navigate between files and will give you basic code highlighting and complete type features.</p>\n<p>Keep a copy of the streaming assets folder, so you can replace files with originals if you break something and need to go back. Using a repository, like git, would be every better but that's a big thing to grok if you don't already know how.</p>\n<p>If/When you make a mistake in the scripts, the in game console should show you an error, that indicates where and what caused it, e.g. missing a `{`.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T11:50:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/997/997356751493d6c7dd1a4d6909b88dd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steve Halliwell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
