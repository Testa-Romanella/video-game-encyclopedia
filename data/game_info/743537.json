Are you a good girl or a bad one? Will you stay in the right path or deviate and fall prey to the temptations you&#39;ll find in your way? Whatever you choose, it will lead to interesting, exciting and vastly different outcomes. This game aims to present you a complex, branching and coherent story, with deep characters and a lot of freedom, with completely hand crafted, hand drawn assets and a very unique art style, different from the usual 3D models. And a lot of kinky scenes and situations!\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T18:30:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/022/022a711d0f54a006fea078d25e55b871.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/join/Evakiss", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
