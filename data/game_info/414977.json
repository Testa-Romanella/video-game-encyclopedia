Over time, John and his daughter Charlotte begin to realise that these objects have unusual physical properties \u2013 and that the more they are exposed to them, the more their reality and memories appear to change.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Main Mechanics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All the Delicate Duplicates is a PC game - containing a non-linear \u2018Back [+Forth] Story\u2019 \u2013 that uses familiar FPS game mechanics to allow free roam around (often surreal) interactive environments. Using a mouse and keyboard and/or gamepad, players explore objects, diaries, journals, newspaper cuttings, mobile phones, laptops and other items left behind by the work\u2019s characters, helping to piece together an elastically fragmented storyline.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Haunting freeform environments with open      exploration. \r\n</li><li>Non-linear narrative that pieces together      through interactive discoveries in the gameworld and a text based      backstory.\r\n</li><li>Music by acclaimed audio creator Chris      Joseph.\r\n</li><li>Commissioned by The Space [the\u00a0BBC + Arts\u00a0Council\u00a0England] , One\u00a0to\u00a0One\u00a0Development\u00a0Trust and Mez Breeze Design.\r\n</li><li>Supported by Tumblr through their      International Digital Media and Arts Prize.\r\n</li><li>David-Lynch-like intrigue (if we do say so      ourselves) via a variable storyline.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Inspirations/Themes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Quantum physics, Multiverse theories, time travel, mental illness definitions, the difficulties of everyday domestic relationships and the games we play within them, gender disparities, the relativity of perceptions and their role in reality-shaping.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Warnings</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All The Delicate Duplicates contains minimal strobe-like effects, minimal to moderate profanity, potentially creepy psychological concepts and themes, and not an ounce of gore. <em>All the Delicate Duplicates</em> stretches storytelling beyond the \u201creal\u201d as you (think you) know it.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:45:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f5ccf0e0337f5e71ed591e4b8663cb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 303, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mez Breeze"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
