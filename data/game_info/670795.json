Unfortunately, visual mode has some bugs including not being able to exit out of certain videos without restarting the program (one doesn't even play the music for some reason). These are marked in the program with an exclamation point.\u00a0It's probably worth a reset to check 'em out, though!\r\n\r\nPRE-TEEN WASTELAND\r\nA MUSIC CARTRIDGE EP BY SLOOPYGOOP\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nPre-Teen Wasteland by Sloopygoop\r\nAll music tracked for Game Boy by Sloopygoop (Andrew Davis)\r\nTracks 1, 3, 5, and 6 composed by Sloopygoop.\r\nTracks 2, 4, and 7 are covers/remixes of existing works by Daft Punk, Queen, Rebecca Sugar and co, Dua Lipa, Georges Bizet, and The Who.\r\nTrack 7 is 100% indebted to a sheet music scribe at Hal Leonard.\r\nThe artwork for tracks 2, 3, and 7 was sourced from various parts of the internet/a Far Side calendar.
