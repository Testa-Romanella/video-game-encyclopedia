There are 3 enemies, the Asteroids, the Hunters, and the\u00a0<strong>Dark Frost</strong>. The Dark Frost is only summoned when a certain threshold is crossed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first game but I'm very happy it's executable at the very least. There is also a downloadable version, in case you wanted to play it in a higher resolution/quality. I hope you guys enjoyed!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>SFX created in as3sfxr</li><li>Menu Music: Pale Light by Hirokazu Akiyama</li><li>Game Music: \u201cI'm going home for the time being\u201d by Tamu (TAM)</li><li>Font: Team 401 by\u00a0imagex </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:20:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f07/f07d466f6f9fd11cbf8138c55226ac70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Conquest"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
