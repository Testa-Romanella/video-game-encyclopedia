I originally was going to make a game that contained a bunch of mini games that each had their own clich\u00e9, the first mini game I was working on was about \"bad eggs\" but the next game was about being blind as a bat. Originally, this game was 2D, but I decided to make this thing in 3D and loving the mechanic, I ended up putting all my attention into making the game solely about a bat that travels through a cave using echo-location.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T19:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74d/74d822fca0a8de6bac03561b4205f19a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Alex Barr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
