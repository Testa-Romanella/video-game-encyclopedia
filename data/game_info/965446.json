{"id": 965446, "slug": "sonic-chrono-adventure", "name": "Sonic Chrono Adventure", "name_original": "Sonic Chrono Adventure", "description": "<p>Taking place after the events of Sonic After the Sequel and Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, Sonic Chrono Adventure sees the Blue Blur spend his well-earned downtime in an expansive region known as the South Lakes. Up in the heavens hangs the ruins of the Sky Empire; a once thriving civilization that fell into ruins one hundred years ago after a mysterious accident destroying its floating island city. Sonic\u2019s vacation quickly goes awry with him being relentlessly hunted down by a battered EGGATS-2013, the owl-like robot fought as the final boss in After the Sequel. Now that the feathery robotic fiend has escaped the Special Zone and developed time-travelling capabilities as a result, EGGATS promptly thrusts Sonic a century into the past; rebels are fighting against the dictatorial rule of Doctor Ucano, the Sky Empire\u2019s Director of Sciences who rose into power within a year before the events of the game. Sonic is forced to watch history unfold as the same incident that saw the end of the Sky Empire draws near under Ucano\u2019s reign, and with Doctor Eggman attempting to assert his rule over the present-day South Lakes as well, it\u2019s a race against time itself to save both past and present from destruction!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T15:03:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec2/ec23c3278355ed51c160071d2340891a.jpg", "website": "https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/sonic-chrono-adventure-1-1-released.30955/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
