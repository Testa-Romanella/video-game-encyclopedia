I only had time to set up input for keyboards with 104-105 keys with U.K English\u00a0layout.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard layout is easy to change in windows. Look next to the clock.</p>\n<p>The game provides an optional keyboard to use with the mouse in case you don't want to use U.K. english!\u00a0 I'm hoping to support other layouts in the future if people like the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rules: \u00a0</strong>The game teaches the rules by itself. But ...<br/></p>\n<p>Objective: <br/></p>\n<p>Start running out of Space and exit the level through Enter.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Movement: <br/></p>\n<p>The movement depends on the last key pressed. Only neighbor keys are valid. Red keys are disabled.</p>\n<p>Manage both, the space in the floor and the space in the keyboard. ;)<br/></p>\n<p>The game is too hard? <br/></p>\n<p>Adjust the speed in the settings to match your typing skill!<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Asset disclosure.<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Skyboxes and background planets by \"StarSphere\"\u00a0 from Marketplace except the moon and color stars.<br/></p>\n<p>Material on player mesh by \"Materialize\" from Marketplace.</p>\n<p>Materials on floors and walls  by Kitbash 3D.</p>\n<p>Music by We love indies.
