Events in the game take us back in the days of the conquest of the Wild West and fight American settlers from the warlike Indian tribes. The bloody war lasted more than 100 years. Violent clashes took place with varying success and claimed tens of thousands of lives on both sides. According to estimates the U.S. Census Bureau between 1775 and 1890 occurred more than 40 wars, that killed 45,000 Indians and 19,000 Whites. <br/>Wild West Checkers offers a peaceful way to resolve conflicts. And who knows, if it had been invented before, perhaps it would have saved thousands of lives! <br/><br/>Rules of the game are diabolically simple. Shoot enemy checkers from the game field while ensuring that as many of yours stay on as possible. If yours is the last man standing, you win. You\u2019ll need a keen eye and strong hand to be the victor in this app but more than that, you need clever strategy. <br/>Each player gets 8 checkers to start, which are placed on opposite ends of the game field. Go ahead and use your finger to pull back your checker, then let go to shoot toward your opponent\u2019s game piece. Little arrows indicate the direction and stroke power of your shot. The player with at least one checker left on the game field wins the battle. <br/>The war is not over with the first battle, though. A second battle starts with the first game\u2019s loser playing with one less checker. Does that ensure that you\u2019ll win this round? No. If your opponent has found an excellent strategy, you may find it challenging to overthrow him in the second game. All is fair in love and war and that includes Wild West Checkers. You never know who is going to win. <br/>If you want to give yourself a game playing advantage, fine tune your skills and hone your moves by playing against the app initially. After you\u2019ve developed your game playing skills, invite a partner to join you in a war game. If you\u2019ve practiced and perfected your game, you\u2019re bound to win more than you lose. <br/><br/>Just to keep things interesting, there are three levels of complexity: <br/>* Easy level \u2014 the arrow showing the direction and the force of strike has depicted <br/>* Medium level \u2014 just the arrow showing the direction of strike has depicted <br/>* High level \u2014 the arrow hasn\u2019t been depicted at all <br/><br/>So, who will you be, the American settler struggling for a place under the sun at least one checker left on the game field, or the American Indian defending their ancestral lands? There\u2019s only one way to find out. Better grab the Wild West Checkers app now so you can start practicing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/426ae446501d571862e1a2c2b0115292.jpg", "website": "http://maxnick.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MaxNick"], "genres": ["Action", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Nikolay Verevkin"], "esrb_rating": null}
