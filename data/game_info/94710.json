This means that both the number of decision points and the number of choices or options that you will find in those decision points may vary according to your previous decisions during the game.</p>\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n<p>The world where the Omega Pattern story happens is seemingly normal, similar to the one we live in. However, genetics and fate mean that a few individuals are born with a kind of <strong>Pattern</strong> or special brain signal which lets them develop unique and varied psychic skills that are determined by their life experiences, which form their behavior and character.</p>\n<p>From the shadows, an organization known as <strong>Bioagora</strong> controls the world according to its own interests thanks to the power and influences that they get, in part, from their Agents. These Agents are people who own the Pattern and have been coerced, bought, forced and even captured against their will to be brainwashed and indoctrinated, so they can faithfully serve the Bioagora.</p>\n<p><strong>Shaiel</strong> (21 years old), a man who possesses the Pattern, has found himself forced to live in secrecy in order to avoid falling into the hands of the Bioagora. However, as time passes, it gets more difficult to escape from a power which is increasing exponentially. Seeking for allies has become unavoidable, and it seems that the only alternative available are the <strong>Celtas</strong>; a small and poorly organized group with unorthodox methods, whose plan to face the Agents and restore an order different to the Bioagora's seems near impossible.</p>\n<p>As the rest of the population stay impassive in a gray world, Shaiel will have Shaiel to play his cards right and find out the truth hidden by the Bioagora, the Celtas and himself.</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<ul><li>Become the Main Character: Decide what to do in the most relevant moments of Shaiel's past.
