If you don't drive carefully, you may end up in a million pieces after colliding with one of the asteroids.</p>\n<p>The ship is affected by\u00a0<strong>zero gravity</strong>. Any force you add to it, it will be kept until you add an opposite force. You will need to properly administrate how you spend the ship's <strong>energy</strong>, since you can end up using it all, and drifting hopelessly through space.</p>\n<p>Warning! Some <strong>astronauts </strong>that were performing some very important investigation got lost in the maze of asteroids and need your help! Collect all the astronauts on a level before reaching the destination.</p>\n<p>Space is dangerous and there is so much to do before returning home.
