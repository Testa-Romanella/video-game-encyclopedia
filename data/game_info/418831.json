I mostly tried to fiddle with the design of it and the animation aspects of it. I\u00a0 still have a lot to learn, but I think it came out alright. All sprites and animations were created by me. This was my first time putting a cut scene in a game. I will probably update this at some point, but for now this is Doodle Dungeon.
