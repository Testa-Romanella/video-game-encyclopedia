However they never expected this job would lead into a journey to save the world<br/></p>\n<p>here's a game i've been working on for some time. this is my first project so i hope you'll find it to your liking. as for its title i do want to mention that i'm not yet decided on what to call it. i chose the words destiny and bond as they relate to themes that the story will explore but i'm hoping i'll come up with a better title when it's done.</p>\n<p>now i should mention that i did not design this game to be a cakewalk. that's not to say that i went out of my way to make it as hard as possible. i tried to make it reasonably challenging without making it too hard. i was able to beat it while playtesting so it is possible to beat it, only took me about 3 hours. still just as a heads up, you very likely will need to grind a bit.</p>\n<p>finally i wanna mention that i am looking for people to help me with this project by making some customs assets for me. i'm especially looking to recruit an artist to make custom artworks for me, specifically monsters and backgrounds for the battles.</p>\n<p>another asset i could make use of is music.<br/></p>\n<p>so if anyone\u00a0with the right skills are interested simply message me. the full release will be released commercially and all participants will receive equal pay.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T15:35:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5c/a5cb48d7f25f1e3a09eff0bcdd970fda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fidens_Libertas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
