But recently, another restaurant popped up down the street, stealing all of your customers! One day, looking at an empty dining area, you decide to become a sous chef and take down the competing restaurant from the inside.<br/>Find ways to ruin the other restaurant's meals. Maybe you'll drive their ratings down enough to bring the town back to your restaurant.</p>\n<p>PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE. I will continue to work on this, but I had to get a version submitted for Trijam.</p><p>FULL DEMO (unreleased):\u00a0https://syntax-studios.itch.io/sous-chef-demo</p>\n<p>Known bugs:<br/>The \"replay\" button breaks the game. This will be fixed in the next version.<br/>The sound for picking up items does not play. This was a bug while building the game (I was on a tight schedule), I\u2019ll fix this as soon as I can.\u00a0<br/>Sot109 - The dialogue box doesn't disappear at the end or in between when the chef leaves</p>\n\n<p>\"Kitchen and more - RPG tileset (16x16)\" made by LimeZu.
