Easy to learn, but hard to master. <br/><br/>The object of the game is to clear the board by removing groups of blocks of the same color. <br/><br/>The more blocks you clear in a single move, the higher your score and the further you can progress in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:01:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ba/9ba6529304c9ed9ed7be98a0f505d157_TkR2GHQ.jpg", "website": "http://charcoaldesign.co.uk/rainbowblocks", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Charcoal Design"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nick Lockwood"], "esrb_rating": null}
