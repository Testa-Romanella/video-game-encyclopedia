Best to line em' up for maximum efficiency. Careful though, you will take a knee and won't be able to move.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There is no endgame btw, just shooting in the dark till' you get bored and move on. It's okay, I'll allow it. Might work on it some more at some point, but for now, it is what it is.
