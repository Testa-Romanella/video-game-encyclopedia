The topic was \"Let's go back to the couch\", so we developed a puzzle game is played via Splitscreen.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note</strong> that due to a bug the game may show a fatal error on the first launch but it will work without any issues afterwards.</p>\n<p>_________</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>(<strong>Recommended</strong>: use 2 Controllers  OR  1 Controller and 1 Keyboard + Mouse)</p><p><strong>Please note</strong> that in order to play with two controllers you will have to download the TwoController version of the game (64 bit only) for now.
