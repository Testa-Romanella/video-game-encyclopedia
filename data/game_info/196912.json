The player will have a hard work to explore the rooms and find out the correct sequence of rooms, going through 3 different \"dimensions\" to find the exit.<br/><br/>For more information about this and other projects:<br/>http://exclama-devlog.tumblr.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d137af9869e1fadac8af3fd35cf1bab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["exclama"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
