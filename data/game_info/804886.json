Werewolf is a classic social deduction game that is played with friends &amp; family. This is a private party game for 5-20 players. Everyone can play together - app is now available on both platforms!<br/><br/>Have a blast, make new memories and laugh all night with your loved ones with this app! This game does not offer public match-making and is designed to be played with friends!<br/><br/>Traditionally, Werewolf could only be played in person and required a player to moderate the game and hence miss out on all the fun. Also needed was a deck of cards, rule book, pen and paper. Furthermore, you needed to carefully tabulate the votes on every day and night round to calculate the outcome.<br/><br/>Our app takes care of all these tedious things so you can just have fun! No more pen, paper, referring to rule book and vote tabulations. We use artificial intelligence to moderate the entire game for you and that means everyone can play the game! If you enjoy moderating the game, we got you covered as well with our human-moderator options. You can play Werewolf in real life or socially-distanced over a Skype or Zoom call. Any video calling platform will work. Players can even be on different continents!<br/><br/>The app will distribute the characters, announce all the cues you need during the game like when it\u2019s time to open or close your eyes, time to vote, when your character needs to take action and who the unfortunate victims are during the course of the game. Can\u2019t get any easier!<br/><br/>All the classic roles of Werewolf, Doctor &amp; Seer are available but you can also play with awesome special roles such as Super Wolf, Psycho, Witch, Priest, Angel and Fool. To spice things up further, you can even specify if the Werewolves can coordinate easily during night rounds or are forced to secretly communicate during the day rounds! This makes lives very difficult for Werewolves since they can easily get caught while trying to communicate who their victim is going to be!<br/><br/>If you love our Werewolf app, please feel free to check out our awesome apps for Mafia, Resistance &amp; Avalon. All four apps are extremely easy to use and tons of fun to play!<br/><br/>It is completely FREE to play Werewolf games!
