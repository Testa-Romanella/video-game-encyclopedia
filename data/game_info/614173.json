I made this in about 2 months in\u00a0Unreal Engine.\u00a0 All 3D, 2D and audio assets used in the project were sourced and are appropriately credited within my GDD. The game isn't perfect and is in beta stage at best right now with some bugs and missing features however it is perfectly playable.</p>\n<p>Another thing is that there wasn't much time to add optimisation to the game so after I added post processing before the upload, the game started to run a lot worse after it's built which is unfortunate. Frames for me were around 20 - 30 FPS but I'm on a lower end rig so results may vary.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:06:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a78/a78246cad41bd8aba80ef872fa91ec1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScottMackenzie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
