If a word or phrase\u00a0is\u00a0blue, it\u2019s either a link or a something you can change. If it\u2019s in the middle of the text, it\u2019s probably a thing about you or someone else you can change.\u00a0You, the player, are traveling through multiple dimensions to search for your sister. You use a material called Sitynur, which can open portals to other worlds. However, you start with only a small shard, which creates unstable portals to who-knows-where. To find your sister, you need to find more of these pieces. The friends you make along the way help you along. <br/></p>\n<p> \tIt's completely text based, with choices that shape your main character  and affects their relationships. There's many characters spanning  multiple worlds to befriend!   </p>\n<p> \tFeatures:   </p>\n<p> \t\t\u2727 Customize your character's pronouns (she/her, he/him, they/them, and  neopronouns), hair (texture, color, and length), skin tone, eye color,  height, and personality. \t\r\n   </p>\n<p> \t\t\u2727 Befriend over fifteen characters, from princesses to hunters to super-powered people. \t\r\n   </p>\n<p> \t\t\u2727 Explore six different worlds, each with a twist. \t\r\n    \t</p>\n<p> \t\t\u2727 Make choices that affect the course of the game. <br/></p>\n<p>This game is in development, with one chapter released at a time.
