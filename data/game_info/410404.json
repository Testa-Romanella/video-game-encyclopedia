Once the hammer is selected, simply smash on things you want to move.</p>\n<p>a\u00a0<strong>Plank</strong>, use it to spawn\u00a0 huge wood plan to consolidate your house. Once the plank is selected, rotate it and left click to spawn a new plank.</p>\n\n\n<p>I\u00a0created for both Global\u00a0Game Jame\u00a02020 and Global Bolt Jam #8, the theme was \"Repair\". I worked alone during 48 hours to build game and I hope you like it.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game as been create with Unity3D (2019.3.0f6) without any development with the help of Bolt (a visual scripting tool). The objective was to really try out Bolt,\u00a0I used multiple Macros and Flows as describe below.</p>\r\nWind\r\n<p>The wind is a macro with\u00a02 states :\u00a0<strong>Rest</strong> (no wind) and <strong>Blow </strong>(push items), the transition between the 2 is made through randoms length timers.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Blow state</strong> is used to setup the force of the wind from a list depending of the current wave. This is also used to move the wind from the left to the right, update the UI with the new wave number and add particles.</p>\n\r\nNPC\r\n<p>The NPC is a macro with 2 states : <strong>Idle</strong> (do nothing), Dead (die), the transition between the 2\u00a0is made through collision with the NPC.</p>\n<p>When the NPC collide with something I\u00a0check if the force applied is greater or less than a predefined number, if it's the case I trigger the dead state.</p>\n\n<p>On <strong>Dead state</strong>\u00a0the dead animation is launched, remove the NPC from the list of the NPC alive and check if the Game is lost.</p>\n\r\nUI\r\n<p>The UI flow is responsible of the different UI trigger like : quit the game, retry, Hammer and Plank tool. It's also used for displaying the Alerte Panel and updating its text, and the game over panel. I also put the Game Over check in it, but it's by lack of time, it don't below here.</p>\n\r\nCursor\r\n<p>This flow is made from player actions as describe below.</p>\n<p>Once a tool is selected you can see it follow the mouse movement.</p>\n\n<p>Once the Plank tool is selected you can use the left click to spawn planks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a really cool and fun experience (even alone), like every year ! Bolt is a really great tool for try out ideas quickly but I found it difficult to use with the UI.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T05:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ef/4ef7532c3ffad2fb495e36f46ff0b58a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Harmonie Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
