Since she is very good in the arts of fighting, she's admitted to the training school of the <strong>Purple Legion</strong> at a very young age. The Legion is made up of expert warriors and wizards who aim to protect the world from evil forces, and for that purpose they learned and teached the ancient art of manipulating <strong>Crystals</strong> to become stronger. After a few years of training, Madeline's agile movements and precise skills made her the most suitable person for an important mission. Her master, <strong>Ettore</strong>, informs that all along he had been preparing her to defend the world from a mystical invasion foreseen by some old prophecy. That's when he sends her to the <strong>Ancient Forest</strong> in order to investigate what is causing this imbalance and close the magical rifts that are open.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>FOR BETTER EXPERIENCE PLAY AS FULL SCREEN</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>THIS GAME'S STILL A DEMO</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A -</strong> LEFT</p>\n<p><strong>D - </strong>RIGHT</p>\n<p><strong>E - </strong>ACTION<br/></p>\n<p><strong>X\u00a0</strong>- SKIP DIALOGUE</p>\n<p><strong>Q -</strong> SKILL</p>\n<p><strong>SHIFT/SPACE - </strong>JUMP (HOLD TO JUMP HIGHER)</p>\n<p><strong>LEFT MOUSE -</strong> ATTACK AND\u00a0MOVE BLOCKS</p>\n<p><strong>RIGHT MOUSE -</strong> SWAP PLATFORMS (OPACITY)</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMadeline\u201d is our first game<em>(still a demo</em>), which started out as a simple project among friends, but as it came to life it became something bigger and that we are very excited to continue. For the time being we offer the first stage of the game, located in the Ancient Forest, and we intend to develop two other levels. The intent of our game is to give you the experience of a sidescroller platformer with an interesting level of difficulty. One that you can combine moments of combat and exploration in balance with puzzles that require precision. All this wrapped up with some intriguing story.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>So, now we ask for your support. If you liked the game (or even if not) we want to know your opinion! Leave a comment about the fluidity of the game, especially in relation to movement, combat, level of difficulty, and also about the visuals and narrative aspects if you can. Or just answer our form, we promise it only takes 2 minutes. We really want to hear you out. And thank you for the gameplay!</p>\n<p>Form:\u00a0https://forms.gle/Y6UzVezQcU96C4jx5</p>\n\n<p>For further contact: doublemindcontato@gmail.com\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T07:43:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dcd5e6846600ec86827d680f4fa884a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["doublemindgames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
