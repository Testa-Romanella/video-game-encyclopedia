I wanted the beautiful feeling of being so helplessly outmatched. In my rendition of combat you have no way to fight back. Simply survive. I made the game using unreal engine over the course of 10 days, everything in the game is modeled, animated, and coded by me. Its currently 5 am before the deadline so I'll be passing out soon. Enjoy rolling around! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T19:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd1082e006ca8812fe0ebdcfb5975ce8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WilleuJeans"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
