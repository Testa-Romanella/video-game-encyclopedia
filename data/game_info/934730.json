{"id": 934730, "slug": "gunnership", "name": "Gunnership!!", "name_original": "Gunnership!!", "description": "<p>For this final, I decided to make changes to the preexisting level 2 as well as create an entire new level (level 3). The first of the three changes I made was that each enemy improves as you advance in the levels. For the gunner ships, I changed them from 1 to 2 guns in levels 2 and 3. I also increased the speed of the chaser enemies from 2 to 5, and then finally to 7.5 in level 3. The second change I made was to increase the size of the map. In the first one, everything is in view of the large camera, and it will only take like 5 seconds to complete. In the second one, the difficulty is increased and the map is a little larger, so it takes closer to 10\u201315 seconds. The final level 3 is a massive map that can take up to 30\u201360 seconds to complete. The final change I made was that I added asteroids to the map, which not only made the levels increasingly difficult but also more fun to play. I did this by adding additional rows of asteroids that make the game more like a maze with enemy ships hidden in or behind individual rocks, so it's more challenging. These changes culminate in a gaming experience that becomes increasingly difficult while still being extremely manageable and enjoyable.</p><p>Credited\u00a0</p><p>Mitchel Brown</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T08:02:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50d/50dbbd3ced846388a5346d5dc1a51b5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["mitchelb23"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
