But sometimes there are signals that interfere with hearing the food order, and so the cat (the player) must switch radio frequencies to avoid the interference. This game aims to teach kids some simple concepts of frequency bands and radio interference.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Artist: Natalie Waltz</p>\n<p>Designer: Kieran Solik\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programmers: Andrea Kang, Shawn Porto</p>\n<p>Project Manager:\u00a0Girish Subburaman</p>\n<p>Special thanks:\u00a0Sherry Hsi and Matt Lewandowski at BSCS Science Learning, Pamela Cosman at UC San Diego, and with guidance from\u00a0Jay Scott and Soha Sadeghinejad at Ubisoft</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T09:12:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55d/55d71cfdcfb78952e15c2c8b0128e3fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeuroDiversity in Tech's Intern Projects"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
