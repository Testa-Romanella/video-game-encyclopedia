The Chaos Supremacists, led by the Imperious-God-Emperor, Xanaphos the Invincible, has been amassing an army the likes of which the world has never seen before. An army bred for one purpose \u2013 the total domination of the western-lands, and the destruction of all ideologies that do not conform to its ideals.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile in the west, the Ankhanesian Empire is fractured. A civil war has gripped the nation, and the Holy Emperor, Cylus I, is in a coma due to the trauma of the assassination of his wife and five children.</p>\n<p>Their deaths are a total mystery because no bodies have been found.</p>\n<p>The story of the game begins, 14 years later, when the fragile peace between the two nations and their allies, is suddenly destroyed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Cursor Keys - Movement, Z - Interact, X - Menu/Cancel, Hold shift+Direction - Dash.</p>\n<p>Psychic Combat - Cursor Keys, Z, X, A, S.</p>\n<p>Chain Combo commands - Cursor Keys, Z, X.</p>\n<p>(Recommended you don't change these keys especially Z, X, A, S as they are needed to be inputted correctly during combat).</p>\n\n\n<p>No random encounters.\u00a0 Enemies can be seen and have line of sight and their own behaviours.
