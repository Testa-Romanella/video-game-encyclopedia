Drag the `.com` file onto the `Boxer app`. \u00a0It should start. \u00a0Thats it.\r\n</p>\n<p>Alternately:\r\n</p>\n<p>1. Download and\u00a0Open DOSBox\r\n</p>\n<p>2. type `mount c ./` to mount the current folder (or whatever folder the .COM file is in)\r\n</p>\n<p>3. type `c:` to go to that folder\r\n</p>\n<p>4. type `slimer2` to run the game\r\n</p>\n<p>If that doesn't work here are some\u00a0instructions about getting DOSBox working on Mac\r\n</p>\r\nOn other\u00a0Modern\u00a0Computers:\r\n<p>Use the .COM file from the zip. \u00a0The process should be similar to Mac but possibly\u00a0you can drag the game (the .COM file)\u00a0into the DOSBox window or onto the icon\u00a0and it will work right away. \u00a0That didn't work for me but if not\u00a0here\u00a0are some more\u00a0instructions about getting DOSBox working on Windows\u00a0Hint: To skip levels press 'n'.</p>\r\nOn Old Computers:\r\n<p>Or for the adventurous and enterprising MS-DOS users out there the .COM file\u00a0should run in any version of DOS on ancient computers\u00a0even as far back as 286's and before. \u00a0 \u00a0I haven't and cant test it on an old machine but please let me know what you find out if you do. \u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T09:00:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/947/94766ecd74669d998eb114a6695ca2f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Fab Dynamic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
