In the beginning I wanted to make blocks and introduce different versions of the ball as power ups but then i scraped the idea by just giving\r\nthe power up its own assigned key. I think two of the biggest hurdles of making a functional level was finding out how the player could be rewarded by exploring the level and trying to get the enemy to have proper collision boxes. I had others playtest the game and the most notable comments that I took from it were how the\u00a0 attacks worked and the\u00a0suggestion was instead of using blocks, it would be easier to have assigned buttons followed by signs to give the player a hint of what happens if they press x button to explore more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T07:40:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/738b0e4444415de1bef7ba3dd488fb96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dmoten55"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
