With sax. And good vibes.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Move with WASD.\u00a0Use the sax with the arrow keys. SPACE to climb poles and metal pipes.</strong></p>\n<p>Made By Stopsignal, with awesome music by Juanba.\u00a0With some code help from Stradex.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Made for the Care Package Bundle!</strong> It's a bundle made with positivity as its main theme. I actually loved to work\u00a0 with all of these amazing devs, please check their games out too! Or why not, the bundle itself:</p>\n<br/>\n<p>This is a really experimental, short game. I'ts mostly an exploration on a theme, an atmosphere, and i hope i nailed it.</p>\n<p>Also, i'm using this as mostly a way to take out some negative feelings that i have being stuck here at home and not being able to see my friends or travel to study. Stuffs weird. And bad. But let's make the best out of it, and make some art!</p>\n<p>&lt;3</p>\n<p>-Stopsignal</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:10:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/976/976a7b794c8d973a946ed3d1c2f34930.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stopsignal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
