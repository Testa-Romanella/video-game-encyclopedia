Earthlings' ammunition is almost completely exhausted, and aliens have almost no casualties. Because aliens' bodies are very special, weapons on earth can't penetrate or hurt them. However, at this time, scientists found a special element on the earth, which can penetrate the alien body. However, the content of this element is very small on earth. Scientists spent all detection instruments and excavation machines and found only a little. The quantity found was only enough to make six bullets. At the same time, scientists have developed space weapons, which are solar-powered and can be used indefinitely. You, as the hero chosen by mankind, will use these six bullets to sneak into the alien's Mothership, avoid or kill all guards, and destroy their core brain, to eliminate all aliens.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T13:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a257738949290da00386bb1551e311.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlackNoteAR"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
