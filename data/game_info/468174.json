However, by doing so you lose the ability to move in that direction.</p>\n<p>I created this game solo. I programmed it with\u00a0Monogame and C#, created the artwork in Aseprite, and built the levels in Tiled.\u00a0I reused some generic code from a previous project, but I created all\u00a0of the game logic/artwork for this game during the jam. I downloaded the sounds from freesound.org. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>-mattmd</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ca/5cadcc2623a8d8efea46bf9731b7da5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mattmd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
