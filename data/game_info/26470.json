Just pop open your \n      Nintendo DSi system and jot down your thoughts! Make a list and cross it \n      off, or even play your favorite pen and paper games (games not \n      included). You can even personalize your notebook by drawing on the \n      cover and changing the paper type with 24 different unlockable squared \n      and lined paper styles. Use the pen or pencil to make your notes or \n      doodles and then erase the bits you don't like. With five ink colors, \n      you'll always be able to make your notes and doodles look stylish. \n      myNotebook also includes 128 pages to write on and the ability to export \n      your pages to your Nintendo DSi Photo Album!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ed/6edb675279dc2772e21e435e7524dee3.jpg", "website": "http://www.nnooo.com/software/mylifecollected/mynotebook.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nnooo"], "esrb_rating": null}
