Pass through every stage, cheat every obstacle not to consume you but to let you pass further into Partyland. Your controls are simple - just go forward or backward and maybe lean from time to time. Your job is even simpler - pass all the levels on your way to Partyland. Stages get harder as you progress further into the game, so be careful! The possibilities are endless, well, not really... All you can do is just be the burger. Sounds awesome, though, doesn't it?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e8/4e84cb68378f1e75a77dfc9098d2398c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anteater Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
