Taking inspiration from games like Portal and Cube,\u00a0 Selective illumination features a special 3-color flashlight that reveals different objects based on its color.</p>\n\n<p>Move through multiple challenges, use the buttons, force fields, lasers and most important of all: light to your advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Selective illumination started out as a prototype project for shader development. The main feature of the game (flashlight that reveals cubes of the same color as its light) is based on one of these shaders. Others include a worley-noise based lava and force field shaders. The game demo was then put together using the prototype shaders.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:47:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c7/0c78e7afdedf934ccb571021bb6cbf5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["olliarkko"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
