Navigate through a world that can easily lift as well as harm you, keeping you disorientated and unfamiliar in your surroundings.<br/></p><p>A world set in five stages, Expand offers an atmospheric experience of exploration, discovery and introspection through gameplay and compelling soundtrack designed to immerse you deeply into its allegorical themes.</p><p><strong>Playing with a controller is highly recommend but nonessential.</strong></p><p>Expand is playable in English, Japanese, French, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.</p><p><em>\"This unique experience is well-paced, polished, and brimming with ideas, and backed by one of the best scores I've heard in years.</em><em>\"</em></p><p>Cam Shea, IGN Australia</p><p><em>\"Expand is a wonderfully original experience that defies easy definition, but when you play it, you will know. You will know you've played something special.\"</em></p><p>Mark Serrels, Kotaku Australia</p><p><em>\"Expand is fiendish and clever, but what really stands out about it is how curiously emotional the experience is.
