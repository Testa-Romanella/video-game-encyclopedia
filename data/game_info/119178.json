My old songs were loud.</p>\n<p>Credit to a kind person on YOYO Games for color palette script and RPG maker 2003 for sound effects, besides that everything else is made by me.</p>\n<p><strong>-GAMEPLAY-</strong></p>\n<p>Use Arrow keys to move (bare with me I would of made it W A S D but this was a bit ago).</p>\n<p>Up to jump, double tap Left or Right to dash, press Down to pick up/Use items or weapons (also to throw), Hold Space for magic (when you get), and Space to attack.<br/></p>\n<p>Use mouse to\u00a0Left Click to go down customize list and Right Click to go up.\u00a0 (| |)</p>\n<p>The <strong>Saves</strong> go into Gamemaker8 folder (just make a folder called Gamemaker 8 if you don't have a folder already)</p>\n<p>Same for <strong>loading </strong>saves.</p>\n<p>It's a .exe so simple!
