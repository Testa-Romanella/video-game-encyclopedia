They have only one weak spot. Their bodies that lie underneath their massive heads. </p><p>You can use these mini spheres by pressing E (whatever that means) once you've picked them up. </p><p>Good Luck and I hope to see you on the other side, meet me at the town just over the sandy mountains if you do manage to survive the bear hunt.</p><p>IMPORTANT: PLAY WITH HEADPHONES FOR BEST EXPERIENCE </p><p>CONTROLS: WASD AND MOUSE TO MOVE, E TO SHOOT ONCE SPHERES ARE COLLECTED. 5 SPHERES ARE GIVEN AFTER PICK UP.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b9/0b9e808021683e1f448916d2f253435b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leem"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
