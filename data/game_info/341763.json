Develop and learn strategy on a small hexagonal grid (2 cells on each side.)  Then, choose regular (or large) grid 3 (or 4) cells on each side for greater challenge.<br/><br/>\u2022 At each turn (epoch), choose a direction to move stars.<br/><br/>\u2022 Certain pairs of stars combine adding to your score. (Hint: Some combinations score more than others.)<br/><br/>\u2022 Stars that can't combine will move if not blocked. <br/><br/>\u2022 Adopt a strategy that doesn't block all movement, otherwise the game may end.<br/><br/>\u2022 If you do very well, you will \"see\" black holes.  Use them to your advantage.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T02:42:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ba/4ba6d807ca2136e350d4163145e716ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Burt Chambers"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Burt Chambers"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
