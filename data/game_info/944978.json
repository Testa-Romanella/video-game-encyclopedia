Determined to chop you to bits, you'll need to fight with all you got or run for your life when this towering pursuer comes for you. Will you be able to solve the mystery of who this post-apocalyptic serial slasher is and put a stop to their reign of terror, or will you be just another victim on the chopping block?<h3>New Orleans Extended</h3> The city of New Orleans has much more for you to explore, both day and night! Find new locales and meet new locals throughout the New Orleans French Quarter, with all the loot, quests, and all the walkers you could hope to slay!

Rejected by the Tower and refusing to join the brutal Reclaimed, these men and women caught in the middle of the chaos can offer you incredible rewards if you take on their daunting tasks and help them establish their claim in this deadly place. Or you could find a way to take their resources by force, if the path of the Sinner is more appealing to you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T09:58:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a673ccd892260b1b1162bed9e283449.jpg", "website": "https://vrwalkingdead.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 15, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 637, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skydance Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Skydance Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
