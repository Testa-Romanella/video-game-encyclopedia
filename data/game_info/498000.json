I hope you have as much fun playing this game as I had creating and testing it! :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T01:55:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca6/ca6d6b38a1b09d086d61260337aca910.jpg", "website": "http://wholetonegames.blogspot.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wholetone Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wholetone Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
