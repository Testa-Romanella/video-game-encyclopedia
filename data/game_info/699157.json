The catapults had been shooting all night. Murk had managed to ward off two assaults from Wayward\u2019s troops \u2013 one at the main gate and one by water, near Icewind Quay. Only when the morning light scattered the darkness did we see the price we had paid to survive that night: new cracks and holes in the thick city wall, a destroyed defensive tower, more homes reduced to rubble, and new fires throughout the city. At least a few dozen dead bodies laid scattered in the ashes, debris, and dust.<br/><br/>At nightfall, Wayward\u2019s war drums began their rumble once again. The catapults were still silent, but they would undoubtedly start singing their deathly song soon. For nine days, Wayward\u2019s hordes had sieged Murk, and every night the city walls groaned under the volleys of stones and fire hurled at them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T04:48:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc54fdd400f9a0d251d25de240cd45f_vw0I1Jk.jpg", "website": "https://www.primegames.bg/en/battle-for-murk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Prime Games EOOD"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Prime Games EOOD"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
