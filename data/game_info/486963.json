Use the mouse to position the ant and the leafs.\u00a0To control the ant movement you place the leaf with the arrow in the direction that you want it to move. This game project was made in 5 days for the Moonlight Game Jam and there are\u00a0for now 10 playable levels.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>J\u00f4natas Lopes</li><li>Thiago Moura</li><li>Gustavo Salmeron (music)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed2/ed2cf7dbaca19b15f141e80064141289.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Jony33Invent", "Ogaith"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
