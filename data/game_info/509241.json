Competition is fierce, and some believe there\u2019s almost no area left unexplored. Yet somehow, you find one. Oh, the joy of securing your promotion! There\u2019s only one problem. There\u2019s another scout bot for a different organization, and there\u2019s no room for negotiation when it comes to discovery. Destroyed bots leave no records. Push the competition off into the depths of the abyss and claim the glory!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T05:06:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/410/4106e4b0eae0a40a43189e48a5cf1c72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Faye", "CJAmbler", "Jayden McKay"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
