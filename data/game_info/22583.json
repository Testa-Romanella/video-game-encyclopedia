But how? Using your creative problem solving ability, you'll have to figure out as much as you can before time runs out.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe test only takes 5 minutes, so if you're curious how your \"intelligence\" compares to other VR users, give it a try!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe are open-sourcing the final score data (all anonymized) so that we can build an accurate distribution, just like a normal IQ test! Check out the 3DIQ blog to see how your score compares to others'. We'll also be comparing Vive and Oculus scores for some friendly competition.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNote: Intelligence is a complex skill/ability. This test is merely one indicator of comparative problem solving ability in a VR scenario, so don't feel discouraged if you get a low score. You'll have a chance to redeem yourself in future tests, and each test you take will help hone your problem solving skills!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCreated by:<br/>\r\nSky Nite<br/>\r\nMichael Carney<br/>\r\nKen Richlin", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8b0bd4e93d7f849f50a9754ac435748.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 117, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 37, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["3DIQ"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["3DIQ"], "esrb_rating": null}
