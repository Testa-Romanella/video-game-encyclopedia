{"id": 258338, "slug": "ariels-story-studio", "name": "Ariel's Story Studio", "name_original": "Ariel's Story Studio", "description": "<p>Ariel&#39;s Story Studio (also known as The Little Mermaid Story Studio) is a point-and-click adventure interactive storybook game developed by Media Station and Creative Capers Entertainment, and published by Disney Interactive. The game was released as a tie-in to the 1997 re-release of the 1989 Disney film The Little Mermaid.[1] The game&#39;s plot is an abridged retelling of the film. Despite sharing the same style of gameplay and the same primary developer in Media Station, this game has never been released under the Disney&#39;s Animated Storybook name, although it is generally considered to be the eighth entry in that series. As a result, the game is sometimes known as Disney&#39;s Animated Storybook: The Little Mermaid.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f09/f09fc08e1f4d910e3a8f8283fb3011a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Classic Macintosh", "PC"], "developers": ["Media Station", "Creative Capers Entertainment"], "genres": ["Educational", "Family"], "publishers": ["Disney Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
