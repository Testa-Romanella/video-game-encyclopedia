You have gotten your hands on 20 of the most crappiest games ever made. Everything from a teddy bear dress-up game to a pearl fishing game. Also featuring an apple catching game, a pretty tedious RPG quest, a pizzeria simulator, a pretty mind-numbing shooting gallery, etc. This collection has everything you could possibly imagine!</p>\n<p>This was just something dumb and random that I quickly put together in like 2 weeks, but hopefully provides some form of distraction and laughs.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Mouse - Click stuff<br/>(For certain games you can even use the arrow keys, although you can also change the controls by pressing Ctrl+Y, then click on the check mark on keyboard for player 1 to change the controls to your liking. Although it only uses left and right.)\r\n</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: If your computer detects the game as a virus, please do the following. Firstly before you download it, make sure to exclude your browser's downloads folder from being scanned by your anti-virus software as well as the location where the game will be stored. That way so your anti-virus won't be able to scan any excluded areas where the game will be contained. Believe me, I had to do it too...\r\n</p>\n<p>Enjoy!!!\r\n</p>\n<p>Game by BigAl0104<br/>Game created with Clickteam Fusion 2.5<br/>Sprites created with the Clickteam Built-In Image Editor.
