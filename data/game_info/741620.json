You are a Blackguard, a knight sworn to serve the Cirigoth Empire and trained in the dark arts, yet hunted by your imperial masters after turning renegade. Only through enlisting the aid of friends and allies can you escape pursuit and defeat the oppressive Cirigoth regime. Journey across the world&#39;s continents to forge a confederacy and fight for freedom in global war. Yet a more insidious plot looms in the shadows. A fallen god seeks to exploit civilization&#39;s folly and reclaim the dreams and nightmares of humanity.</p>\n<p>The linear story of Everlong is accompanied by numerous side-quests. It also focuses heavily on puzzles, dialog, and battle strategy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T01:53:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f6/1f643cb63c0db425bbe7132347eefa82.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/3600/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
