The player will either be in the offensive or defensive mode of the duel, but the tables can always be turned depending on their performance. Duels become faster at higher difficulties, and players can also opt for long-ranged attacks if they prefer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Regular enemies will attack in waves. Players can take out several enemies in a single swing, but they will also have to stay on their feet to avoid a relentless barrage of attacks. Dodge rolls and special attacks can make all the difference in these battles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Enemies can spawn on the rooftops of certain buildings, the streets beneath them, or any floor in-between. Players will need to track them down by running up walls, jumping onto balconies, or even just using the elevator.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Below is a map of the level 'Central' with each spawn area marked. Within each area, there are multiple possible spawn points. Other parts of the map can still be explored for pickups.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T02:50:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68f/68f2dfb29098e1b5bbb15fca015d0b9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LT"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LT"], "esrb_rating": null}
