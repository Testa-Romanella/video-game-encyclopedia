A very short piece of interactive fiction about a \"round-topped utensil\" trying to find their place. Four possible endings.</p><p>The results of a long-running inside joke about calling people spoons, a reasonably old computer which is able to run Twine, and a fascination with the concept of anthem meaning a place of belonging and home. First digital game I've made. In future, this would have wild backgrounds while accurately depict scenes of the wilderness (or, as my friend is suggesting, the inside of a kitchen \"as the game's already weird enough\"), but for now, enjoy the plain colours and interesting misadventures of a Spoon trapped in a Forks world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14dabb9431f37f2bcea71d2df292c997.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jess Gates"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
