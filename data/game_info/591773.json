World of Goo meets dominoes!</p>\n\n<p>- Drag blocks off the conveyor belt and onto your structure. Get your center of mass as low as you can with 100 blocks.</p>\n<p>- Blocks with matching edges stick to each other.</p>\n<p>- Scaffolding is lighter than Plates and affects your center of mass less.</p>\n<p>- Blocks wear out and break over time. You can damage scaffolding by clicking on it.</p>\n<p>- Free-floating blocks will fall off your structure, but you can catch them with blocks below...</p>\n<p>- You can embed new anchor points in the wall, but only if you already have a block adjacent for it to match with.</p>\n<p>- If you build a whole line of blocks across the chasm, they will wear out much slower.</p>\n<p>Try and beat my high score of 57!</p>\n<p>As required, the game is open-source.
