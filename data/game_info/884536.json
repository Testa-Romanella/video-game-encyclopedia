Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nWhat is it\r\n<p>This is a full conversion mod for FreeDoom running in GZDoom. All equip-able items (\"weapons\") are custom made with original photography.\u00a0 Original music. Dozens of lines of\u00a0original voice acting. A built from the ground up \"journal\" feature which updates as you progress.\u00a0I'm pulling textures and sprites from Doom 2, Hexen, Strife, HacX, TekWar, and Blood (a lot of them are intentionally distorted/discolored).\u00a0I'm also using some audio from Hexen, HacX as well as NPC audio from GTA San Andreas/Vice City. There are 7 or so missions across one map, as well as hidden collectible items. Any NPC can be interacted with and there are 11 characters that you can engage in dialogue with. Complex NPC AI.\u00a0Three possible endings.\u00a0 I might put out a mac version soon.</p>\n\n\r\nContributions by others\r\n<p><strong>Misha Kurita\u00a0</strong>contributed two songs, ambient sounds,\u00a0 sound effects,\u00a0and voice acting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colin Sakamoto\u00a0</strong>contributed photography for in-game items.<br/></p>\r\nI'm packaging a few free tools with this game.
