A world forgotten by man.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Welcome to \"A place unknown: the missing world\", a Text Adventure by Fennecai Fox Creative.</p>\n<p>You awake locked in a small padded cell with nothing more than the clothes on your back and an empty backpack...soon, you discover that you have been transported to a world forgotten by mankind. Surrounded by a decaying overgrown city, you wonder, \"Where is everyone?\"</p>\n<p>This is a text-adventure I have been creating in some form for a few years now; and I am still re-writing it to this day as one of my many projects.</p>\n<p>The more people support this game (not just through purchases, but through comments and other forms of appreciation), the more likely it is that i will finish it, but for now, I am putting it online for a low price in hopes to gain some support for this game and other projects of mine.</p>\n<p>Although there may still be typos, minor grammatical issues, and mis-spellings throughout this story, I hope you will enjoy it nonetheless. Currently, the story is not finished- It has merely begun, and i have several ideas for it's future. but that said; I would greatly appreciate any feedback you may have on how anything can be improved. If you see a mistake in grammar, punctuation, spelling, or anything else of the sort, please do not be afraid nor hesitate to leave a comment or contact me so I can work on improving this game. This doesn't just apply to the story itself; but also the design of the interface- I realize that its currently not the best, but your support will greatly motivate me to do better.</p>\n\n<p>To see more of what I do, take a look at my website:</p>\n<p>https://1995aek.wixsite.com/fennecaifox<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/82628fc9a1225aa9ab116df1ac21644c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fennecai"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
