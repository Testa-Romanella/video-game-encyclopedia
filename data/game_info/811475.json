The enemies are relatively complex AI (relative to me). They can take off their head to throw at you, and search for their head again when they've thrown it</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYou can pick up stuff with the right mouse button, and throw stuff with the left mouse button. (and move with wasd or arrow keys). Try to stay alive as long as possible.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\r\nMost of the assets used here were made by the lovely Kay Lousberg, check out his stuff here on itch and on his patreon. <br/></p>\n\n<p>\n<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYou'll see two builds. One is the normal one, if you just want to play the game. The other one is the dev build, which shows in which states the AI are in during the game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T11:33:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b227da8c6f7ab1e1fecda96b7f1cda22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smos Bois"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
