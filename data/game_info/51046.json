Relive the nostalgia in these bite-sized adventures - but without all the pain. Autosaves, a text parser with auto-suggest, and puzzles with no dead ends, all combine to bring this old genre into the modern era.<br/><br/>In Chapter 3, survival is at stake again. But whose survival?<br/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><ul><li> Autosaves - no need to save every few minutes (though you still can if you want).<br/></li><li> A text parser with both auto-suggest and auto-correct - fat finger your way to puzzle glory (but you can turn them off if you want to suffer more greatly).<br/></li><li> A text parser that understands what objects are in front of you, so you can be lazy and just type things like 'get' or 'look'.<br/></li><li> CRT emulation mode that gives those pixels an ever-so-slightly fuzzy look.<br/></li><li> A stereophonic score.<br/></li><li> Cute snails.<br/></li><li> Deaths (but hey, autosaves).<br/></li><li> No dead ends! Puzzle your way around with impunity!<br/></li><li> Widescreen aspect ratio, since monitors are more rectangular now.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T09:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/152/1528d3dfb5f0a9888fff873b700148d8.jpg", "website": "http://snailtrek.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phil Fortier"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Phil Fortier"], "esrb_rating": null}
