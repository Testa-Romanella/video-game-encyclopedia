But...<br/></p><p>A Home in Darkness is a Horror game inspired by classics such as \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"Silent Hill\".</p>\n<p>However unlike in those games you aren't shooting your way through enemies, but instead <strong>perform rituals to fend of supernatural powers</strong> in your home! You need to <strong>figure out what entities will haunt you</strong> at night and based on that<strong> research arcane spells in old tomes</strong>. Oh and be careful when performing the rituals<strong>: </strong>Slight changes, like using the wrong candle or setting up the ritual at the wrong place may have terrible consequences. <br/></p>\n<p>You might be able to survive one night, but can hold on until all evil has been purged?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e72/e72a7c6b5f5cc69bc89b93ad3527fcaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin Senges"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
