{"id": 236588, "slug": "the-basilisks-maze-alpha", "name": "The Basilisk's Maze (Alpha)", "name_original": "The Basilisk's Maze (Alpha)", "description": "<p><strong><strong>Keyboard Controls:</strong> </strong>Arrow keys to move, space bar to pause/unpause.</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse/Touch Controls:</strong> Click/tap arrow buttons OR click/tap area around character to move in that direction (I'm experimenting with these two methods; I'd appreciate feedback on which you prefer, especially on a touch screen).<br/></p>\n<p>He\u2019s the thing of nightmares to all creatures of the Fairy Lands: the Basilisk, a colossal beast with a paralyzing gaze and jaws big enough to gobble up a dragon whole! Few meet this terrifying monster and live to tell the tale. Will you be one of the lucky ones?</p>\n<p><em>The Basilisk\u2019s Maze</em> is a simple, spooky arcade game where you take control of a denizen of a fairy tale land and try to escape a randomly-generated maze before the titular monster catches and eats you.</p>\n<p>That's about all I have so far, but soon I'll be fleshing out this basic concept with additional features such as gold to collect, hazards to avoid, and an ever-fading lantern to keep lit. There will also be extra characters that can be unlocked with your gold, including humans, dwarves, dragons, unicorns, and whatever other fantasy critters I can think of.</p>\n<p>Once the base game is finished, I'll be moving the mobile version to app stores (and maybe charge a buck or two for the finished PC standalone version) and, hopefully, continue to support it through content updates, adding new playable characters and game modes (some of my ideas include a multiplayer mode, a \"first-person\" mode, a \"play as Basilisk\" mode, and a simple story mode).</p>\n<p>But anyway, that's all in the future. So, for now, I hope you have fun trying to escape\u00a0<em>The Basilisk's Maze!</em> Oh, and if you have any feedback (positive or constructively negative), I'd appreciate a comment!</p>\n<p><em>Coming soon in Alpha 5.0: GOLD! Why are these creatures risking becoming Basilisk's dinner in the first place? Money, of course! Get as much cash as you can before making your escape, but beware! If you're caught, you only get to keep half of what you gathered, so don't be too greedy!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df5/df5673715731b9468611093183edaee7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Dragon King Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
