Play games with three different difficulty levels so you can work your way up to playing like a pro. Euchre Card Classic has many settings so you can configure the game to play with whichever rule variations you prefer including: farmer's hands, stick the dealer, game winning score, hints, undo button, and adjustable game play speeds for slow, standard, or fast play.<br/><br/>If you are new to the game, Euchre Card Classic has a rules view to teach you how to play.<br/><br/>An analyze button can be turned on to help you evaluate your hand and pick a smart bid by simulating thousands of games and showing you likely round score outcomes. A hint button can be turned on to help you see what card the computer pro player would play in your situation. Extensive statistics are kept for wins/losses and success rate in making your bid.<br/><br/>All cards are dealt randomly to all players, so the difference between the Easy, Standard, and Pro computer players is in how well they remember what cards have been played and how they choose to play the cards they are dealt.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T03:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/930/9303c973a533a138f81f41a252711ba4_fSKmuud.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Games By Post"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Games By Post"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
