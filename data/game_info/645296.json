You collect different colored particles, steadily growing your trail - in size and in color. No goal, no aim, just floating and relaxing and enjoying the view.</p>\n<p><strong>stardust</strong> is influenced by sci fi books like The Martian Chronicles by Bradbury or Foundation by Isaac Asimov. It is made to reflect the atmosphere of eternal loneliness - instilling a feeling of silent terror, beauty and awe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Excerpts of Steam Reviews:</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL game! Imagine Flower but in space and without the six-axis controls and cutscenes, and you have Stardust. It's just overall a really pretty and relaxing game.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"it's like.. ASMR for the eyes\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Atmospherically, it also took my heart. The music and sound effects never assaulted my ears, and actually made me calm and focused. For replaying it, you can do that as many times as you want! There's no story, only a calming place where you travel around collecting star-dust and becoming the prettiest astro-body.\"</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T06:16:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e61c9a64cab8114beec7bafd6d1137b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pidibidi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
