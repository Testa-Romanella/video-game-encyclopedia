They can't notice pleasant things, or color as much, and their special ability is taking naps. They have less energy (can't jump) and they feel the ceiling is closer to them than it is and can't hear the melody of the music.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>The yellow character has a phobia / panic attacks related to the pink things as shown through the music changes and sprite swaps. Their special ability is dashing.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>The cyan character has dysmorphia, and has trouble perceiving their actual size.\u00a0 Their special ability is jumping high.\r\n</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>\u2022WASD to move and jump (if able),\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022Spacebar to use the special ability.</p>\n<p>\u2022Tab to switch characters</p>\n\n<p>It is currently very buggy, and I am sorry about that. Just lower your expectations. I have verified that every level is solvable.\u00a0\u00a0Just ask\u00a0if you want help with any of them.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Anyone from Sweet and Power Sauce, I'm sorry, but I need little side projects to get me through the big one. Think of this as a prototype for a next thing</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T15:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aed/aed35496e2676bf145afe58af62b1c73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["juzek"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
