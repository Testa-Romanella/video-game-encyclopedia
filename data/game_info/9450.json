Thats it.<br/><br/>You can also use a more familiar twin-stick control scheme with your Gamepad OR Mouse + WASD.Leaderboards?Absolutely, but there's a catch: everything will reset the next day with a rank upgrade and <strong>new waves</strong>, a fresh start.What about the upgrades?As you shred the enemy to pieces your ship will transform and upgrade automatically. There are four upgrade stages, each with its own unique weapon. Upgrades can level up and be obtained multiple times but each time they will be harder to get.
