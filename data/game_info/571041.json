Inevitably, you will drop the rock and you will have to start from the bottom. You will drop the rock if you lose your balance, if you get hit by a falling boulder, or if you fall into a chasm.</p>\n<p>Each step left or right throws you off balance. Each step forward helps you bring the balance back. If your balance gets to 1.5 or -1.5, you will drop the rock.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Move with WSAD, the arrow keys, or the D-pad.</p>\n<p><strong>THANK YOU</strong></p>\n<p>This is my first published project. It was created in two weeks for GAB Jam: Fresh Start. Thank you for being interested! If you have any feedback, please share it in the comments.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PSA FOR CHROME USERS</strong></p>\n<p>If you're using Chrome, I recommend downloading the desktop version of the game or playing it in Firefox instead. When I run the game in Chrome there are some noticeable audio artifacts. I don't what causes them or how to remove them. I tried reexporting and\u00a0reuploading the game, but it didn't help :/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:51:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fe/7fe6ba6273bdf52de844d1fd502ba01f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MaryWillowson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
