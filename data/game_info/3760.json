Try on the super-strength of Hercules, or the fighting speed of Atlanta, or the street smarts of Jason. It&#39;s open season on the one-eyed Cyclops, the multi-headed Hydra, Medusa with the snake hairdo, sword-swinging skeletons, deranged gods, nasty Martians, crazy clowns and other not-so-mythological monstrosities. With your arsenal of arrows, slingshots, swords, houses, sheep, inflarable cows and ray guns it&#39;s up to you to save ancient civilization from massive myth-fortune.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T10:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/16821edaf7d3cf4c7dc4b35393ef24c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.21, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 11, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 14}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Big Ape Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
