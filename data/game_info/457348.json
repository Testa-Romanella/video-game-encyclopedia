The longer the word, the more points you gain, but the longer it takes to move it across the fridge. Your goal is to bring positive words to the positive sentence structure, and negative words to the negative sentence structure to gain points. You must choose words carefully, so you can get as many points as possible and make as many positive sounding sentences as possible for some one to read and feel better about themselves.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:59:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e25/e252d29e34913c4846c1a3e7b8ea9c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CIvan", "Olli Machina", "NicholasPerell", "nebulis", "Donovan Garcia-Buckler"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
