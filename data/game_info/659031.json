You can find the models on Sketchfab. (Arcreactor&amp; Thors hammer)</p>\n<p>Because i didn't just wanted to model but to actually play with them i created this game.</p>\n<p>Its's pretty straight forward. Move with the WASD Keys und look around with the mouse. With the left mouse button you can cast the arcreactor and with the right mouse button thors hammer. Kill the red enemy's with the reactor and the blue ones with the hammer. The more enemy's you killed the faster new ones will spawn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun! Please feel free to leave any critique\u00a0you want to share with me. It will be highly appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T10:52:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/554/55405aa5cd7d98fe525b5535f42c9fb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AtmoGD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
