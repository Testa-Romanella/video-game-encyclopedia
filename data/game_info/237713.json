The player who gets three of their pieces in a row wins the game.<br/><br/>\u2022 Tile Puzzle: A classic game where a player slides square-shaped puzzle pieces horizontally or vertically into an empty space until all of the pieces are in order numerically.<br/><br/>\u2022 Memory: A card game where all of the cards are initially laid face down. The goal of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. The player wins when all pairs have been exposed and, as such, all cards have been turned over.<br/><br/>\u2022 Nim: A simplified variation of the Ancient Chinese game. Players alternate between picking up one or two diamonds. The player who picks up the last diamond wins the game.<br/><br/>\u2022 Fortress: Find the \u201cEXIT\u201d.<br/><br/>\u2022 3 in a Row: A different take on Tic-Tac-Toe, a classic \"paper-and-pencil\" game where two players take turns placing a piece (\"X\" or \"O\") on a three by three board. The player who gets three of their pieces in a row wins the game. Unlike Tic-Tac-Toe, pieces always \u201cfloat\u201d to the bottom of the board.<br/><br/>\u2022 3 Memory: A card game where all of the cards are initially laid face down.
