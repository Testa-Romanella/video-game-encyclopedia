It's not special in any way and it's meant to be a short little thing you pick up and play. This project started, as always, with me being bored. Since I wasn't home and couldn't work on other stuff, I decided to test my programming skills by making a short little console turn-based RPG, nothing more, nothing less. And here we are...</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Story? What story?! You're just a little wizard guy who got thrown in a pit full of other angry wizards, you call that a story?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As I said, it's small, so don't expect crazy amounts of controls. You only need <strong>ARROW KEYS\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>ENTER</strong>. Also\u00a0<strong>ESCAPE</strong> if you want to exit out of the game, but you will have to start from the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>Download &amp; instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>It's down there, look! Also, in order to open the game, you will only need to click the executable/application file, and nothing else.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T08:29:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0dffb4d4b9d93f7c3b40478dee37d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LucaS RedDragon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
