Explore the ever-changing maps, fight with deadly enemies, and learn what happened to the cursed island of Avalon. \n<br/>\n<p>In-game features, languages and system requirements may vary between titles. <br/>Please check particular game cards for more precise information.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-26T03:42:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb435cf39bed7781185a3becfab32c49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 358, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stygian Software", "GOG", "Questline"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["GOG", "Stygian Software", "Awaken Realms"], "esrb_rating": null}
