Using a video terminal and a 300 baud modem, the\u00a0two young friends connect to a computer located in a basement at the university, long nights of coding and design before the rise of the videogames industry.</p>\n<p>And then, the unthinkable happened. The connection to the computer is broken, and the work done during the weekend is at risk of being lost. There is only one way to fix it: Glenn should venture into the depths of the communications center, and restore the connection before it's too late.</p>\n<p>But on his way to the computer: humans. And within the interaction with them\u00a0the opportunity\u00a0of being a kind, honest person, or just brush them away.
