Whoever has the most points after all minigames are complete, wins! Here are some of the challenges you will compete in:<br/><br/><br/><strong>BBQ off</strong><br/>Cook as much meat as possible within the time limit. Make sure you don't burn the meat though!<br/><br/><strong>Lawnmowing</strong><br/>Mow a lawn... More than the others<br/><br/><strong>Beer Collecting</strong><br/>You are in desperate need of some beer. Run around and collect any beer you can find before the other Dads find it!<br/><br/><strong>Camping</strong><br/>Collect important materials located around the map and improve your campsite before it's too dark!<br/><br/><strong>Surfing</strong><br/>Look back to your glory days and bring back your exceptional surfing skills. Use these old-school skills to stay in the water and avoid waves for as long as possible!<h3> Character Customisation </h3>Make your dad look stylish! Create your unique look by customising the colours of your shirt, shoes, skin, shorts, or beard!<br/><br/><h3> Secrets... </h3>Keep a lookout for the legendary Aussie beer bottles. Can you find them all?<br/><h3> Why? </h3>Well, you see, Darren here is sick and tired of the lack of Australian-dad representation in video games! So, he assigned me the task of creating the greatest Aussie video game, one where he can finally prove that he, and maybe you, are the greatest dads of all time.<br/><br/>- School photo of Darren from 1975", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T09:53:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c71/c71cb90251758bfc413a92dba3db1daa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benjaydev"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Benjaydev"], "esrb_rating": null}
