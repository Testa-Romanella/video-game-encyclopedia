In this jam we tried to do an ambitious game, perhaps too ambitious, we hade to scale it down, and in the end it is more like a tech demo showcasing the possibilities with Unity 2021 and URP, Deepest Dungeon is a pretty simple and straightforward action combat game, you gotta kill all the enemies in a floor, and jump down an ominous hole in the ground to go to the next floor (until you kill all the enemies, a ring of fire will prevent you to jump down), you will be presented with a powerup choice at the end of each level, but the enemies will be powered up too! if you die, back to square one, let\u2019s see how deep you can get! The game is technically infinite, so it only ends when you die!<br/></p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\r\n<p>WASD - Move the character around\r\n</p>\n<p>Mouse Right Click - Sword Rotating Slash\r\n</p>\n<p>Mouse Left Click - Sword Slash\r\n</p>\n<p>Mouse Middle Click - Jumping Attack\r\n</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\n<p>Andrea Di Bartolo : 3D Art, Lighting\r\n</p>\n<p>Samuele Padalino : Code, AI\r\n</p>\n<p>Claudio Scamporlino : Code\r\n</p>\n\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<p>- Sometimes enemies explode upon loading the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:09:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8b/e8bfe73e1df1dff8d5458a89ed0ff785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CyberLab Studios", "R4ndomThunder", "Andreadbx Games", "Evercloud"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
