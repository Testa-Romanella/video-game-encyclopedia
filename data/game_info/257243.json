The player character is an unnamed college student who is attacked by demons along with his girlfriend; they are saved by the timely appearance of a suave demon-hunter named Kyouji. Shortly thereafter, Kyouji is found dead under suspicious circumstances. The protagonist is then trapped inside of a warehouse and murdered by a deranged killer named Sid. Rather than stay dead, the player finds himself in the reanimated body of the slain Kyouji, and escapes from the morgue. With the help of Kyouji&#39;s voice, which guides the player from inside his head, the main character joins up with Kyouji&#39;s female partner Rei in order to save the life of his girlfriend, who is still in danger.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T08:53:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1a1/1a1edee13bca04f4f42428308c27c3e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 5, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 30, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "PSP"], "developers": ["Atlus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
