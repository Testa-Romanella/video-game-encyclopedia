Help Mario get through his treacherous new problem and reach and defeat Bowser!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>This project took me about a week to make, and originally started as a joke between friends. As a kid, I always experimented and loved soft-body and physics engines on my small Windows Vista computer. Now, I put that love into a game I call \"Get Up Mario!\", which most of you will be screaming as you play it. This game is in an EXTREME beta, so please leave any comments or concerns you come across.</p>\n<p><strong>Changelog 1.1</strong><br/></p>\n<p>New additions!\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Changed\u00a01-4 drastically<ul><li>Made the 5th star coin harder to get\r\n</li><li>Bowser has a funny animation when dying now!\r\n</li><li>Bowser is always seen dying\r\n</li><li>Added a segment between Bowser's room and the entrance that includes some nasty tricks &gt;:)\r\n</li><li>Slightly altered the decorations and added some new ones (obviously)\r\n</li><li>For some reason, I forgot to remove the playtesting power ups for 1-4.
