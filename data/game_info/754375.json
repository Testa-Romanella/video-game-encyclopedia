Inspiration was taken from my film series about Homeless (homeless superhero) and \"Gamedev with Pico\" series.\r\nGame is some kind of joke, don't get it serious. UI is written in Polish and less-english language.\r\n</p>\r\nYour mission\r\n<p>You have to fly among the sky and beat the best score! Have fun with gliding with umbrella.\r\n</p>\r\nModes\r\nSingleplayer [Friendless]\r\n<p>Yep, you don't have any friends and only way to play the game is to play by yourself.\r\n</p>\r\nMultiplayer [Singleless]\r\n<p>Woooah, you have friends? That's awesome! Play with them in competitive mode. One player uses arrows and the other \"E\" and \"D\"\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Control your character by going up or down. You can use arrows, \"Z\", \"X\".\r\n</p>\r\nMy channel with weird films\r\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ7lxeXOgbmREH1B2VoPWEg\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T15:34:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/618c2c553cd32bb824f56c589eea7f72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BKsc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
