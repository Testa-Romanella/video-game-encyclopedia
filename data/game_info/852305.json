Flocklings in the idle state wander aimlessly around the map. By clicking and dragging a flockling, you can send it to a desired destination. All units within a certain radius of the selected flockling will follow it to the set destination. It can hapen that food bearing plants or enemies can cross the assigned route and distract the following flocklings. Routes must be planned well in advance to ensure that all units move to the correct location. Once at the destination, flocklings react to food or attackers by gathering away or attacking. The collected resources are then brought to the nest, where they can be used to generate more flocklings. But, the more flocklings exist on the map at the same time, the faster your remaining food resources will decrease. The goal is to, keep your flock alive as long as possible by planning efficient routes, fending off attackers and using resources sustainably.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T19:37:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c67/c6767215b2000498b3f375c2bba83206.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlockGame"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
