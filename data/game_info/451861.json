There was also a table top version of the game, with differing rules and gameplay to the handheld.</p>\n<p>The game has been re-released several times, including as part of\u00a0<em>Game Boy Gallery</em>\u00a0for the\u00a0Game Boy,\u00a0<em>Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4</em>\u00a0for the\u00a0Game Boy Advance, and as a digital download for the\u00a0Nintendo DSi.\u00a0 It's been described as the strangest game in the Mario franchise.</p>\n<p><strong>C64 Port</strong></p>\n<p>As one of my favourite Game &amp; Watch games growing up, and as an exercise in learning C64 6502 Assembly language, I decided to port the game to the C64.\u00a0 I've tried to keep the gameplay as close and authentic as possible to the handheld original.\u00a0 \u00a0I have not seen any dissassembled code of the original, I just played the handheld game a lot.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game took me about 5 months working in my spare time - I developed a large portion of the game live on Twitch most Mondays.\u00a0 You can follow here : Hayesmaker64 on Twitch\u00a0I also stream C64 and Amiga gameplays and my streams are archived to watch any time in the <strong>Videos </strong>tab.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>The player controls Mario working in a cement factory, where one has to make sure the cement carried from the top of the screen reaches one of the two concrete mixers on the lower corners of the screen safely. The cement can't go directly into the mixers though. It must first go through four tanks which Mario can open by activating levers. His task is to go back and forth between all four spots and release the concrete before anything is spilled. Failure to do so will result in dumping of said concrete on the truckers waiting to make their delivery. To reach the different levers Mario must travel between floors via elevators, which must be taken carefully to avoid Mario falling off. Game B is a harder version of the game.</p>\n<p>Welcome to My <strong>Mario's Cement Factory C64</strong> Port!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Code &amp; Graphics; @hayesmaker64</li><li>Music:\u00a0Phaze101</li><li>SFX: @richmondmike</li></ul>\n<p>Mario's Cement Factory Game &amp; Watch\u00a0(C) 1983 Nintendo</p>\n<p><strong>Releases:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>v1.0 release:\u00a07th June 2020</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T03:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/611/611713e6cdb6d2deaaa6ed4b308d7c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hayesmaker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
