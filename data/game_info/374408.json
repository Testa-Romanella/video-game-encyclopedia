Only 1 person is engaged in it.</p>\n<p>You need to complete the levels for two heroes simultaneously. If one hero goes to the left, then the second is repeated immediately after him. Thus, you need to get to the door through obstacles. Some moments in the game cannot be transmitted to characters without special blocks. You will fight with the bosses.</p>\n<p>At the moment, there are: 14 locations, 2 biomes, 1 boss.<br/>In the future it is planned: 28 locations, 4 biomes and 3-4 bosses.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T08:19:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f1/3f1de57f15dc124d6c13f9e50c7c95ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vorgeus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
