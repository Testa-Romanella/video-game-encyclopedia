These vegetables are more desirable than gold because they are tasty. But for rabbits, they are even addictive and worth killing for. The more they gobble, the more they corrupt. The overdose of carrots is the reason their little brains are rotting... carrotting! It is a story about the terrible disease that turns cute and innocent bunnies into ruthlessly evil creatures. Their violence is second to none. They are clumsy but still capable of sophisticated weapons and science in a battle against their rivals. Their rampageous greed pushes them to raid space and bunnihilate planets just to hunt down more and more carrots. Their reason is malfunctioning, but they are still able to accomplish the venture. It\u2019s truly ridiculous.<br/><br/><strong>Become a bunny, become the destroyer of worlds in the chase for carrots!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:06:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/006dd8fa77c80ea5c823ad7b6b51b48b.jpg", "website": "http://carrottingbrain.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Raving Bots"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Raving Bots"], "esrb_rating": null}
