I love crafting stories and worlds for people to learn about and explore and thought an interesting way in which to do so was through the virtual novel medium. This is Fate Maker Games first project, with many storyboards and notes for future games connected to this world.</p>\n<p><strong>Hopes for Production:</strong><br/><br/>Our hopes for production include the involvement of the player base when possible on certain decisions in the design of some story lines. Eventually if we gain the interest we would like to run a kickstarter and all those involved could help vote on placement of eventual CG's, some aspects of plot design, and so on. Of course with other kickstarter goodies being possible in limited numbers like the virtual designs of PC's (within what fits to the world) or prompts for dates or other event scenes in the game.\u00a0 Right now we're still fairly early in production and this demo is likely to evolve over time even before further parts of the game move forward.\u00a0 Feedback is greatly desired and appreciated\u00a0to help improve and build on both this demo and the future of the game.<br/><br/><strong>Progress of Game:</strong><br/><br/>Written: 5.5 days of 28<br/>Programmed: 5.5 days of 28<br/>GUI \u2013 Still needs upgrade<br/>Character Art \u2013 Artwork finished on 8 characters (8 More Needed)<br/>Background Art \u2013 Finished<br/>Approximate percentage of completion: 15%<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Questions for Players of Demo:</strong><br/>Are there any suggestions as to the description of the characters or narrative that you feel could add to the game?<br/>Are there any aspects that really interest you?<br/>Are there any aspects that you feel detract from interest?<br/>What was your impression of the demo overall?<br/>Did this page present the demo well?<br/>Did you find any glitches or bugs that need to be addressed?<br/>Was the writing acceptable?
