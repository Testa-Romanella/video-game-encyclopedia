The goal is to kill as many fruits as possible and not let them get by you. If they do, a death wall slowly comes toward you. We aimed for specific arcade characteristics, such as replayability, challenge, and to be simple yet engaging. The increasing speed of enemies makes the game tantalizing and puts pressure on the player to perform better as the game progresses. This makes the game challenging, as the difficulty will increase the more you play. The game has an easy to grasp the concept and makes it clear to players what they need to do. However, the simple mechanics also add an entertaining aspect, keeping the player hooked throughout the entire experience.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:03:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/eda6aa239ed206e36fb02ec3c6ef7417.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkCynder11"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
