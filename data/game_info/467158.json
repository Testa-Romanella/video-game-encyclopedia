You are Bronco, a space bounty hunter who rides a 2010\u2019s Viper Model A. It may be a jalopy for most people, but you know that the old reliable Vipey never lets you down. Everyone knows a little fix here and there mid-flight is part of the fun, as long as it doesn't get <strong>out of control</strong>.</p>\n<p>Try and eliminate the biggest space fugitive to claim your reward and finally step down from the job and live the good life you deserve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 edition. The theme being out of control we decided to give the player a jalopy space ship that starts going <strong>out of control </strong>randomly, expected after so many years and adventures. The player needs to choose if he wants to be exposed to repair his ship or start relegating control of it.</p>\n<p>Music, art and code was 100% made by our team.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't forget to rate the game!!
