Rotate your way through difficult tests of timing, speed and thinking.<br/></p>\n<p>Use down and up to move your swivel point clockwise and anti-clockwise. Use right and left to rotate clockwise and anti-clockwise. The objective is to reach the end of the stage. Currently there are three playable levels.</p>\n<p>WASD, arrow keys and controllers can be used. Mobile <em>is</em> supported with swipe controls, but is currently far less than ideal; playing on desktop is <strong>extremely </strong>recommended.<br/></p>\n<p>Any and all feedback, suggestions, criticisms and bug reports are welcome.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T03:53:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a3/6a30c589b3c98e9b1f0590d9dbee499b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jamdog"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
