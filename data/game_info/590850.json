Many cities are going under lockdowns, non-essential businesses are forced by the government to close, and consumers are avoiding public places. Likewise, a lot of stores have to adapt and be flexible to meet the changing lifestyle, the new normal.<br/></p>\n<p>Shipbob, a shipping and fulfillment partner for ecommerce stores, has gathered and tracked data from more than 3000 of their merchants. Though it shows some fluctuations, the month-over-month increase in 2020 for online sales for food and beverage is 18.8%. A lot of people are choosing BOPIS (buy-online-pick-up-in-store) or delivery in effort to avoid crowds at supermarkets and public places.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Therefore, this application is delivered in respect to the increasing trend in online shopping for food and beverages. There are many online food ordering systems which provide the list of menu and delivery, but so far, there has not been a 3D simulator of the store and the product itself. Sometimes, it is a bit hard for the customer to imagine how the food would look if there was no image, or if there was, it would just be a 2D photo. It is common that the size and shape that the customer envisioned would not be proportional to the real food. Being able to roam the bakery in 3D and see the name, price, shape, color and size of bread directly would make online shopping experience more interesting.\r\n</p>\r\nObjectives\r\n<ul> <li>E-Wallet provider in the initialisation\r\n  </li><li>To display the name, price and 3D model of the items      when in range\r\n  </li><li>To track the stock of the items in the bakery real time</li><li>Online Paid Advertising through TV<br/>\n</li><li>Calculating items\u2019 price total to be paid system on tablet and deduct from E-Wallet\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T11:26:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e83/e83878c81df1d1ae46e725ebab4fd725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["supendi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
