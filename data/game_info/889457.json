You are Trent Rose, a hero. However... you recently had an injury which allows you to only jump a few times before you can't anymore. Of course Toadorre conveniently left some items to give Trent a few Jump Boosts! You will have to go through Toadorre's Castle solving puzzles to move on. Then you must beat Toadorre, and save Princess Verity. This game is in an NES Style. I hope you like it! There are some bugs and glitches but not many, tell me if you find any in the comments! Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>I was originally going to make a game called NinjaKnight for the Platformer Jam 2, but didn't have enough time, so i made this! I am still working on Ninja Knight! And it will be amazing!</p>\n<p>Art and Code: PokeDude645</p>\n<p>Engine: Gdevelop</p>\n<p>Music: Fesliyan Studios Royalty Free Music</p>\n<p>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com<br/></p>\n\n<p>PASSWORD CODES:</p>\n<p>Room ???: 101010 (RGB SPLIT WARNING, ALSO CREEPY)</p>\n<p>Rat Spin: 111001</p>\n<p>Level 1: 100100</p>\n<p>Level 2: 100011</p>\n<p>Level 3: 101001</p>\n<p>Level 4: 000010</p>\n<p>Level 5: 110101</p>\n<p>Level 6: 101000</p>\n<p>Level 7: 101110</p>\n<p>Level 8: 100111</p>\n<p>Level 9: 110010</p>\n<p>Level 10: 110111</p>\n<p>Level 11: 001000</p>\n<p>Level 12: 101101</p>\n<p>Level 13: 111101</p>\n<p>Level 14: 111110</p>\n<p>Level 15: 011111</p>\n<p>Save the Princess: 110110</p>\n<p>Ending : 100000</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T18:43:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/987/987782b085698ee88a084432a54cab67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PokeDude645"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
