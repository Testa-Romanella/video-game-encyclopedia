It is a narrative-based adventure game with a survival sub-theme. The player uses a fishing rod to capture mechanical fish and prevent them from crashing into their balloon. Their goal is to keep their balloon from running out of fuel, while also using acquired Fish to trade in for upgrades which make controlling and protecting the balloon easier. Over time the player will continue to acquire upgrades that give them greater control over their balloon and more fishing capabilities. The player and the player character will utilize their ship along with its upgrades to explore the sky and eventually overcome the final challenge of climbing through the looming storm clouds above in order to find their way back home.<br/><br/>Any feedback is appreciated, thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T11:02:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ac/5ac399087860ff78a6497061df438201.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AIE Seattle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
