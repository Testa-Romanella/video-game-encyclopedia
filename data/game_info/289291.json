Anubis eats souls. The main goal is to release the soul. The soul is released by merging and blasting ancient blocks of the same type. If you do not want to give your \"soul\" to him, play the game as long as you can.</p>\n<p>In this game the main goal is to stay alive as long as you can and with that comes beating previous top score. You must be careful, because fields are filling with new blocks every once in a while. Do not let the blocks fill the table.</p>\r\nGame mechanics\n<p>Blocks can be moved horizontally or vertically by using mouse left click. By joining and eventually destroying blocks you will feed the Anubis and earn points.<br/>Your mana bar is increasing when you earn points. When mana bar reaches the top, then you can use one of the five power-ups.</p>\n<p>There are two types of power-ups: destroying and time. Each power-up helps you to overcome difficult situations.<br/>First three power-ups can destroy blocks and that will be:</p>\n<ul><li>color explosion\r\n</li><li>orthogonal explosion\r\n</li><li>square explosion</li></ul>\n<p>There are also two power-ups that can decrease creation of new blocks:</p>\n<ul><li>freezes creation  of new blocks for some time\r\n</li><li>decreases creation  frequency  of new blocks</li></ul>\n<p>On the right side of the screen there is death bar that indicates how many free fields are left in the table. When it reaches the end, it will be game over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T04:00:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/29419ebaf75a09216023c74899ea22ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KYOTONTEAM"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
