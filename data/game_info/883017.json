And she wears a maid costume anyway, so who cares?<br/><br/>My Furry Maid is a kinetic novel about a guy who works as a teacher in a housekeeping school and his new student Anna. She wants to study maid classes for a role in a TV-Show, so he'll have to teach her etiquette, housing and cooking for a whole week. How long will she last until falling in love with him?
