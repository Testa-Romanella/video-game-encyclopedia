The people you help, the trees you destroy and the animals that are in panic (and get in your way) will all be affected by you and your actions alone. Choose wisely, as the world is watching and judging you,\u00a0 assessing your personality. What ending awaits you, depends on everything you did before the door closes. For in this game - actions speak louder than words.</p>\n\n\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Jump</p>\n<p>F - Dash / Cut Down Trees</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T04:10:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a274db6f4dda9fa496a87792d7eaf7db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zettovyker", "pattaq", "Lociro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
