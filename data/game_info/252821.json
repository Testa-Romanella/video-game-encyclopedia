Use magical cards to aid you in traversing the mystical library as you climb, wall-run, and dodge your way over gaps, past flying books, and around the menacing\u00a0owl guardians who watch over the library. Will you answer\u00a0Minerva's call and stop the curse?</p>\n\n<p><em>Minerva's Library </em>is a 3D puzzle platformer where the player must navigate maps using spawnable platforms and a parkour system in order to reach the end of the level.
