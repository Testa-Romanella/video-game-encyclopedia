However, the wind also alters the environment, by rolling dangerous rocks and moving foliage out of the way. <br/></p>\n<p>While playing the game, it is important to use this to your advantage and always be aware of your surroundings. The goal is to get as far as you can, while picking up as many valuables as you can on the way. Will you make the risky move to grab the treasure, or will you try to play it safe, that is up to you.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made during a two week course at FutureGames by 10 students.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Vanessa Sj\u00f6 - 3D</p>\n<p>Simon Elasson - 3D</p>\n<p>Sonya Belgacem - 3D</p>\n<p>Rasmus Carlz\u00e9n - 3D</p>\n<p>Herman Tidblad - Design</p>\n<p>Emile Sterner Jonsson - Design</p>\n<p>Teodor Huldt - Design, Sound, Music</p>\n<p>Jonathan Rawet - Programming</p>\n<p>Philip Wallner - Programming</p>\n<p>Fredrik Henriksen L\u00f6vlie - Programming<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T03:46:22", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Ten"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
