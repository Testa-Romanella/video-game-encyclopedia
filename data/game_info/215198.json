This means that you can't move around to other cover or try to run away from enemies.\u00a0The game is controlled with one button, so your only option is to pop out of cover and shoot at the enemy at the right time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wish I\u00a0could have done more in time for the jam, but I\u00a0spent a lot of time wrestling with Unity to do what I want. What\u00a0I have is a pretty terrible product, but one that was still good practice. I plan on adding more updates over time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37f0e3b57efec31ded3c2e035291e756.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KIsForKid"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
