Humanity was at their worst peak; self righteous and lazy whilst robotics<br/>took them wherever they desired. <br/></p>\n<p>The life of a cyber hacker was hard in these easy times. That was... if you were human. most crime at these times were created by robotic beings, as they leave no traces behind at the scene.</p>\n<p>One such event was the breach of Temprol, Capital of Devolus.<br/>Draconic Wishbone gang leaders caused chaos around the<br/>neon lit nights, causing uprest within the docked locals and those docking.</p>\n<p>Police showed relentless force against the Draconic Wishbone, using their most<br/>recognisable vehicle: The Slingshot to cause as much destruction possible to<br/>the police forces of temprol and neighbouring cities.</p>\n<p>The Slingshot was eventually taken care of by the police force, but the<br/>event remained a historical learning point for future attempts at any<br/>cyber related crime and those against it.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move with the <strong>WASD </strong>keys (<strong>Arrow Keys </strong>for those who are left-handed)</p>\n<p>Aim with the\u00a0<strong>Mouse</strong> and shoot using the <strong>Left Mouse Button<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Pressing <strong>1</strong> uses <strong>Ability 1</strong>, a rocket launcher that launches a single rocket in a straight line and progressively increases in speed until it hits the edge of the screen or an object/enemy.</p>\n<p>Pressing <strong>2</strong> uses <strong>Ability 2</strong>, a Shuriken that spawns at the location of the player, spinning around and shooting a large array of shots around the screen.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Hey, I'm Dave and\u00a0this was my Final Year Project for Uni in 2020. I am still learning how to create more detailled pixel artistry and once I am confident, I will redo all the art of this game and maybe add some new weapons, enemies or mechanics to it. I tried to experiment with a futuristic environment as I really love the cyberpunk/synthwave movement recently but I felt it doesn't really fit in that characteristic.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Art, Gameplay and Coding done by myself using Piskelapp for Pixel Art, GiMP 2.10 for any external editing and Autodesk Sketchbook for iPad Pro for concept art.<br/></p>\n<p>Music is: Disconnected &amp; In the Belly of the Whale by Nihilore, you can check them out here: http://www.nihilore.com/synthwave<br/></p>\n<p>Sound effects created by myself using https://www.bfxr.net/<br/></p>\n<p>Font used: https://www.dafont.com/symtext.font?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:46:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37f3d6e4daac32d875e58d0b3512223f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["David Mallett"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
