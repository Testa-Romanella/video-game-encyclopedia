That's this game in a nutshell. Enemies cannot be damage by shooting them directly, so, like Revolver Ocelot, you must damage them by ricocheting your bullets off the environment and into the enemies. The fancier the shot the more points you earn, so don't be afraid to style on your foes.</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n\n<p>\"Cognitive Dissonance\", \"Harmful or Fatal\"<br/>Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Don't forget to leave some feedback and be sure to check out some of the other submissions to 7DFPS!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bf/4bf9a7cac80c160ac4deb3107f698ab5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MedicOnDuty"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
