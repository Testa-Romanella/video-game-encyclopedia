The view changes to first-person FPS when we observe the area through a building window or through a telescope.<br/>\r\nLooking through the telescope, we can turn on the image from the camera tracking the bullet's flight in real time, which is useful at long distances when the bullet's flight lasts several seconds and the target is less visible.<br/>\r\nThe bullet's flight is reproduced in accordance with reality, taking into account gravity, side wind and decreasing speed with distance.<br/>\r\nIt happens that shots are fired at a distance of over 2 km, the game area is approximately 3x3 km, it is a desert with four built-up districts.<br/>\r\nGenerally, our opponent is a group of bandits who want to take control of the newly created city, the player's task is to eliminate them from the occupied area.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-25T11:38:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/186/1864120fd0f9af0d94c5cdde229ea60b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shargames"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shargames"], "esrb_rating": null}
