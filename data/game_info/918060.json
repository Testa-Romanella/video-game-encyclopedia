But as you are wrapping up and getting ready to leave, you notice something odd. Shrugging it off, you decide to walk along the pier back to your boat, taking in the scenery as you go.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Do you look through the telescopes and observe the beauty that nature holds? Or do you mind your own business and ignore what's happening around you?</p>\n\n<p>The choice is yours...<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Walk</p>\n<p>W - Hold down when in boat to move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>MOUSE - Move/Look through telescopes</p>\n<p>SHIFT - Sprint</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p>\n<p>F - Flashlight</p>\n<p>P - Pause<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>A Walk Along The Pier is a short narrative-driven story, with an emphasis on environmental storytelling.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The idea started on a Sunday and was completed within 3 days.  I am trying to work on smaller projects that challenge me in new ways, be it coding, modeling, effects, or just general stories that I want to develop.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game and story I have created.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>- Aaron<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>I am always looking for support on projects, be it financially, video playthroughs, or just a friendly follow on Twitter. With the everyday challenges now facing us, it is becoming harder and harder to make games for free and even support this as a full-time career.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0If you or anyone else you know is able to support me, please find my links below.
