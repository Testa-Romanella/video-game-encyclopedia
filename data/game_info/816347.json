It was released only in Japan on November 16th, 2017. It was released ten days before Tamagotchi&#39;s 21st anniversary, which foretells multiple corner shops from previous titles; each having updated gameplay, mechanisms and quality. It is the sixth entry, and the last installment of the 3DS series.</h2>\n<p>*As the eighth installment in the Corner Shop series, this game allows players to work with Tamagotchi partners to manage various shops and serve customers, with the goal being to upgrade all of the shops to royal status. Most of the shops are taken from previous Corner Shop games, with some updated details such as the graphics. The soundtrack for the game uses a mix of music from the past Corner Shop games too. The minigames become slightly more difficult or advanced with each upgrade, and a wider variety of customers will visit as well.</p>\n<p>*Aside from opening and upgrading shops, one of the main goals is to collect all of the available customers by serving them. There are 240 Tamagotchis in the game, including ones that need to be unlocked by entering passwords.</p>\n<p>(*Source of Description - &#39;Tamagotchi Fandom Wiki&#39;; &#39;Tamagotchi no Puchi Puchi Omisecchi Ninki no Omise Atsumemashita&#39;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-14T21:01:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c63/c63f2f5b81f18d9a083c338232f34f9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 19, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
