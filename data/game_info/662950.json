All teams were tasked with creating a wave-based game that would meet the requirements specified above.</p>\n<p>Our team dived headfirst and started pumping ideas into a discord chat so that we could narrow it down to ideas we all liked.\u00a0After a lot of brainstorming, we had decided that\u00a0each starstone would hold a specific ability that the player would be able to use throughout the rounds, dependant on the type of stone they chose.</p>\n<p>Aside from this, we wanted to go that extra mile and further developed the game to have another objective (other than to survive) which was to repair a clock to go back in time before the temple 'leaked' souls. As this was my first ever Unity 3D Project, I was happy with what we were able to produce for this module.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:42:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d36/d3642b96f2ac2bdf90c1a8db79f2fb28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wotsern"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
