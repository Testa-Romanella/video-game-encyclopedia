This should be the final version of the game, unless serious bugs turn up, or the game\u00a0somehow gets really popular and people want me to add more to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player, a young mage apprentice, is trapped in the titular magical dimension armed with only their trusty wand, and must escape by finding spell abilities and using them to solve puzzles, defeat monsters, and reach new areas of the game. The game's nonlinear progression and open-ended puzzle design allows the player freedom\u00a0to approach the adventure in their own way. Can you escape from the Arcane Plane?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/476/476cf177b8bf073eba284d8aaadbc506.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emoglobin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
