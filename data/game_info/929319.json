The survivors therefore work during the day at the campfire so that they can reward Bulbie's services.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Character</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Wizard\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>The Wizard is a character who appears on the first night. He explains that he has escaped from a pack of wolves. Old and tired, he wants to stay in Bulbie's camp. In return, every morning he delivers a parchment with information about the princess that he was able to see with his magic ball.</p>\n\n<p><em>The explorer\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Mihana has been an adventure and exploration enthusiast since she was very young... maybe a bit too much since she lost herself completely. She loves adventure and when she hears Bulbie's quest, she absolutely wants to join him. To do this, she will draw him a piece of map every day so that Bulbie can access new areas without fear.</p>\n<p><em>The princess</em></p>\n<p>So coveted by Bulbie, she is his destiny. She will never appear in the game or in the demo except in dialogue bubbles.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Map</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Day night cycle\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>A day lasts 6 minutes and night falls. To sleep, you just have to stick to the tent and Bulbie automatically falls asleep.</p>\n<p><em>Thank to</em></p><p>https://itch.io/profile/cosmosun\u00a0(Map with me, Logo, One Page, advices Game Design and Level Design)</p><p>https://brullov.itch.io/fire-animation\u00a0(animation Campfire)</p><p>https://parabellum-games.itch.io/16x16-slimes\u00a0(Slimes)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T09:12:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a6/0a611f3e6b651907277def55cbad91df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aur\u00e9lie Roux"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
