The Overlord has enacted some new laws to keep the galaxies safe and peaceful. He's not a bad guy - he just doesn't want things to get out of hand. And some stupid rebels are already stirring things up, which isn't cool. Order has been restored, and revolutions are definitely not allowed.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are loads of weapons, items, skills and even potions out there for sure. But they're strictly forbidden! So don't even think about going around combining everything and causing trouble. It's way too much power. Why destroy everything? What would your mother say?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is technically possible to go on a super sweet galactic journey with your pals where you basically destroy everything in sight and crush the \"bad guys\"... but it's banned, big no-no.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are tons of mysterious (and possibly exciting) things out there, but you can get lost in the galaxy. And then what? Who\u2019s going to look for you? Don't go traveling around trying to find new stuff, it's 100% forbidden.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list of banned occupations has been extended to a total of 9: the Alien and Gangster professions are now prohibited as well.Other forbidden Key Features:<ul>\n<li>Destroying environments is forbidden: just because they are procedurally generated doesn't mean you can destroy them\n<br/>\n</li><li>The use of over 200 items and 180 abilities is forbidden: too many combinations, all of them potentially dangerous for the Overlord's army\n<br/>\n</li><li>Most Wanted: for the toughest rebels we have 5 difficulty levels. This is not a game!</li></ul>\n<br/>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T04:53:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1a/c1a72c76931df4e6303600bdcf50f04a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Molton Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Raiser Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
