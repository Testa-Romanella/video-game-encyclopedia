In a 1 vs 1 match the player has nothing but a laser gun in his hand and the goal to find the opponent, but he is initially unable to see him across the map, as they are both invisible. Wondering through beautiful and mysterious environments, he will find some power ups which will make him able to get hints on the opponent\u2019s position. This power ups will indeed make the opponent leave traces, blink, or be targeted inside the game world.</p>\n<p>The whole game is about visibility: the environment has the goal to make the player feel lost\u00a0 and lonely, and creates a sense of abandonment which accompanies the player through the whole match. Beside, the game focuses on the ability of each other to stay hidden by going through the many narrow corridors, labyrinths\u00a0 and buildings while, in the meantime, approaching the enemy. To enhance the focus and the player reasoning, he also has to deal with a finite number of shootings, after which a cool down time makes him vulnerable to attacks and makes him focused on the spots in the map where he could hide to put himself out of danger.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:21:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/779/7790ba006152d1df3f56398b02c82a00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
