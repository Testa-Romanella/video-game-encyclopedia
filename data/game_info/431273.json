But this didn't connect well with the <strong>alien theme</strong> we chose from the two themes revealed at the beginning of the Jam. We wanted to create a crafting game in which you have to <strong>experiment with the ingredients</strong> and you <strong>don't have well-known and logic crafting recipes.<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n<p>After you played our game please rate us for the Jam and leave a comment, what you liked about \"Cosmic Cuisine\" and what <strong>we could improve. :)<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Music used in the Game: <em>\"Surreal Chase\" by Eric Matyas Soundimage.org</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:36:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/070/070d36122b5563835535f3763df7c44b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nfvfire"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
