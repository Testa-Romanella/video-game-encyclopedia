There's only so many items you can carry before the size of your inventory crushes you!</p>\n<p>Some items will stack into a more valuable item, freeing up space for you. Keep an eye out to what's happening in your inventory! You'll want to note down how items combine in order to increase your survival rate.</p>\n<p>Other items are basically junk, or rarely stack up. You can slide under them (s/down keys) or jump over them\u00a0\u00a0(w/up keys)\u00a0 to avoid picking them up. Furthermore, you can maximize your stretches by dashing forward (d/right keys).</p>\n<p>Oh! It turns out you'll also need to fend off the guardians on the dungeon! Just jump over them or onto their heads and you should be fine.</p>\n<p>Remember - you can't run from your own inventory!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>w/up to jump</p>\n<p>d/right to dash</p>\n<p>s/down to slide</p>\n<p>Platforms: Windows\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0\u00a0LomDom and Knightsunder</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/BlondeAnt<br/></p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/_Knightsunder</p>\n<p>Music: Lobsterblues</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/kedercreatie<br/></p>\n<p>Code: Distorter and Fusionnist</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/theDistort</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/Fusionnist<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/295/295817a51c251190c9f59e9b378a930f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fusionnist"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
