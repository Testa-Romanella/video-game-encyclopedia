When the evil Rukifellth found one of these elements - the powerful Celestial Stone - he used his influence to assemble the dreaded BHB Army. Armed with his new army and a giant space warship, the power-crazed Rukifellth began scouring the galaxy for the other 7 elements, invading planets and enslaving innocent races throughout the galaxy. Rukifellth controls these enslaved planets with special Gravity Generators - the same devices the BHB Army used to create a Black Hole. Rukifellth uses his Black Hole to capture new planets... But he should have thought twice before he tried to capture Bomber Planet!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T11:25:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f369dee74c0488b51b1c27036477e88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 5, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 15, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Hudson Soft"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo", "Vatical Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
