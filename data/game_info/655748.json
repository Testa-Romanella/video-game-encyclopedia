Sheep within the players light can be herded away with space bar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Black sheep are bad, and bounce around the play area, infecting any white sheep they touch. They cannot reproduce. They can be made good again if you (the shepherd) touch them, or by thowing your staff at them. It takes 5 seconds for them to become contagious.</p>\n<p>Aliens will try and abduct your good sheep, so make sure to throw your staff at them to eventually take them down.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f85602c26fbbba1ee02590b426882f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mace707"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
