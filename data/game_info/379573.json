Customers flock to watch the spectacles, and the victors win the glory and the sales!Your <strong>Wares </strong>are your <strong>Weapons</strong><br/>Stitchcraft is a two-player strategy game where the cards aren't proxies for ogres and dragons - they themselves are the actors in the game.  Playing a tapestry unleashes the enchantment woven in, then contributes towards building a winning sales showcase.<br/>\u200b<br/>With a single spell woven into each of just eight colors of rugs, the rules are simple enough for anyone to play... <br/><br/><br/><br/>...but conquering a cunning opponent is another matter.  Practice in single-player mode versus the AI player, then take on other spellweavers in online multiplayer matches.  If you ever master a particular Pattern, choose a new one for eight different spells that promote fresh strategic challenges!<h3>Mercantile Mayhem</h3><br/>To begin, each player starts with a Chest of five Tapestries in each of eight different colors.  These 40 Tapestries are stacked randomly with their colors hidden from view.  Players draw three Tapestries from the top of their Chest to start the game, and additional Tapestry each turn.  Player 1 skips their first turn draw.<h3>Artful Actions</h3><br/>During each turn, players may Play and/or Reveal Tapestries.  Each player may take two of these actions per turn in any combination: Play twice, Reveal twice, or one of each in either order.<br/><br/>Play a Tapestry<br/>Click a Tapestry in your hand to Play it into your Display on the table in front of you.  A Tapestry in the Display is Unrevealed.  The opponent can't see the color, and its power is ready to use on another action, but it is not yet part of the Showcase victory condition.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Reveal a Tapestry<br/>Click a Tapestry in your Display to reveal it and release its color's Power.  These Powers may provide boons to you or sabotage your opponent.  If the Tapestry is successfully revealed, it moves into the Showcase and counts toward the many-color and color set victories.<br/><br/><h3>Plethora of Powers</h3><br/>Each game match is governed by a Pattern.  Every Tapestry of a given color will release the Pattern's Power for that color when revealed.  <br/><br/>Powers are designed to maintain a subtle identity across Patterns for a given color, but in combination, they can dramatically warp the strategy between matches of different Patterns.\u200b<br/><br/>Players should start with the \"Loom\" Pattern, then check out others such as \"Attrition\" and \"Racketeering\" when seeking new challenges!<h3>Wiliest Weaver Wins</h3><br/>Build an impressive Showcase to dazzle the market tourists!  The first player who assembles seven out of eight Tapestry colors or four Tapestries in a single-color set wins the game and makes the sales to the impressed audience.<h3>Real Artisan Crafts</h3><br/>Stitchcraft has collaborated with The Anou to feature genuine artisan handiwork, billowing in the wind on display in each player's showcase!<br/><br/>The Anou is a cooperative organization that develops user-friendly software and trains the artisans of Morocco to utilize it to take control of their business, instead of losing their revenue to the middleman supply chain.
