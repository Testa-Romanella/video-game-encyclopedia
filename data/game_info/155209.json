This was a huge learning curb for me about so many factors of development like\u00a0scope, teamwork, communication\u00a0and even what not to do with certain elements of level design. We all have these \"failed\" projects, however this project taught me so much so I class it as more of a success in moving me forward in my skills.</p>\n<p>We spent a lot of time on a polished hub world and could not deliver an actual level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, proud of what we accomplished as it was only a second attempt at developing a game.
