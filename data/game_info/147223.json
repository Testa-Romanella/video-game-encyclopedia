Grow a dynamic little forest, see how long it can survive, experiment with the different algorithms, or burn it all to the ground! Whatever your heart desires.<br/></p><p>Inspired by the forestfire.exe cellular automata in SUPERHOT. Each cell sprouts or burns based on whether there are grown or burning trees around it<br/><br/>Button 1/Z - Settings menu/fast menu scrolling<br/>Button 2/X - Probabilities menu/close menu</p><p>Arrow keys move the screen around or control the menu if it is open. Press left/right on a setting to decrease/increase its value. Hold Button1/Z while pressing left or right to make a setting increase/decrease faster.<br/><br/>Menu 1 has general settings, including the growth algorithms and the chances for trees to grow/burn next to each other.<br/><br/>Algorithm 1 uses the Von Neumann neighbourhood<br/>Algorithm 2 uses the Moore neighbourhood<br/>Algorithm 3 uses another neighbourhood I don't know the name of? Trees sprout at diagonals to each other<br/>Algorithm 4-6 use the same neighbourhoods as 1-3 respectively, but will only sprout/burn if there is only ONE tree next to a cell.<br/><br/>Menu 2 has the probabilities for a cell to randomly change state, regardless of whether there is a tree in its neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Enjoy! :) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/120a6ab8325360557899171f30eddba5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ashley Pringle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
