The objective is to find a way inside the temple, retrieve wo trinkets, and present them to the temple's deity. Gameplay revolves around the staff the player wields, which in its two different states, manipulate the environment an assets around the player.<br/>Tempo Temple's art-style takes major inspiration from Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft. We attempted to use a similar technique to them, with mostly low poly models and more detailed digitally painted textures. All assets within the scene were created by us, minus the UE4 mannequin and the animations we acquired from Mixamo. Models were created and initially UV'ed by Austin, who then passed them to Dakota for texturing and final placement in the level. We split the work across our strong points in a successful attempt to lower the overall difficulty of creating the level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:48:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c3/4c38fcb69d94034ab196927a29808719.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yearya"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
