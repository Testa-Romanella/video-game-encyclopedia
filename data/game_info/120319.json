The catch...every time you play a new set of modifiers will be applied that could make you stronger, faster or even weaker. But what's the fun in being the only one getting modified?! So watch out your enemies can become stronger as well.</strong></p>\n<p>Attack of the Skeletons!! is a wave survival game where each time you play is a little different. This is because random modifiers are applied each time you play that can change up your and your enemies attributes such as health and speed.</p>\n<p>Attack of the Skeletons!! was created as a submission for the 2017 Random Generation Jam and was inspired by game modes such as Zombies in Call of Duty and Test Your Luck in Mortal Kombat.</p>\n<p>I hope you have as much fun playing this game as I had\u00a0making\u00a0it. Please leave any feedback in the comments section of this page.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for checking out my game. <strong>Have fun and go kill some skeletons!!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/556/556505a9f321d87c55950ed9b67e006e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VixMix"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
