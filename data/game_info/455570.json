{"id": 455570, "slug": "spinmaster", "name": "Spinmaster", "name_original": "Spinmaster", "description": "<p>While they never reached the top tier of names like Konami or Capcom, you could generally count on Data East to bring out quality arcade games. This one\u2019s no exception, and although it\u2019s not quite as weird or unique as something like Nitro Ball, it\u2019s still a ton of fun. It\u2019s actually more like a spiritual successor to Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja, which isn\u2019t really a bad thing at all.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s not much of a plot involved with Spinmaster, not this sort of game really needs one. You play as Johnny and Tom, two treasure hunters differentiated by their hat, or lack thereof. They\u2019re both out looking for pieces of a treasure map, as treasure hunters tend to do. Complicating matters is their enemy, the mad doctor that Data East swears isn\u2019t cyborg Dr. Wily. Also, there\u2019s a kidnapped girlfriend involved. No surprises there. The game itself is split into five stages set in different parts of the world, split into two or three \u201cscenes\u201d each, so you can expect to see your standards like the China level, Rome/Greece level, and Amazon levels. Sure, it\u2019s about as cliche you can get for a game like this, but it doesn\u2019t make it any less fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-21T11:59:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f09/f094c7c56d6807868db3d40047202ff7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Neo Geo"], "developers": ["Data East"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["SNK"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
