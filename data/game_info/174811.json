{"id": 174811, "slug": "hoe-down-throw-down", "name": "Hoe Down Throw Down", "name_original": "Hoe Down Throw Down", "description": "<p>A game made for the Weekend Crazy Game Jam, whose theme was \"Oustanding - damage - rose\". </p><p>There wasn't a whole lot of inspiration to this game, I kinda just started with a vague idea and went with it. I know that I wanted to do a big boss in the middle of an arena because I always enjoyed that in games, but other than that, I just went with whatever came to mind. This being my first game jam, I had a lot of trouble, especially since I was working alone, and I had to work day and night to complete the game in time, but I loved every second of it. If you enjoy the game or have feedback feel free to contact me and let me know.</p><p>The objective of the game is to destroy the rose in the center using rose clippers. To do this, you must use your trusty hoe (this hoe is loyal) and water bucket to grow corn, which you can then use to buy stuff. You can buy upgrades (and rose clippers) from the merchant in his shop.</p><p>Be careful, because the rose can cause weeds to grow in your crop plots, making them take longer to grow.</p><p> Pull on your overalls, and rub some dirt on em' because it's time to hoe down, and throw down!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/4846bc1fcbf840f0bbb7ae2f60f42ebf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jonathan Serbent"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
