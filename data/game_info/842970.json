After defeating an enemy, you are rewarded with Coins which can be used to summon allies. Allies gives you bonus stats, passive abilities and active abilities (which are called \"Gifts\").</p>\n<p>Keys:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD : to move</li><li>Mouse Left Button : Shoot Projectiles</li><li>You can aim with the mouse</li><li>Numbers key from 1 to 5 to cast active abilities (only if you have allies activated)</li></ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, I ran out of time, maybe because I aimed too high for a week-long project, I would have liked to add more levels, enemies, abilities indicator, more allies and of course allies' descriptions.</p>\n<p>Keep me in touch if you want me to expand this project.</p>\n<p>Big shoutout to @finalbossblues and @HumblePixelShop for their awesome work.</p>\n<p>Feel free to follow me on Twitter: @Padrox_dev</p>\n<p>A game made by Padrox.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T08:45:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b01/b012f83fcf36b8ea157b612836f2bb41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PadroxDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
