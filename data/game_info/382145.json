The main goal is to try to survive for as long as you can in the arena and score as much points as you can. <strong>Why wouldn't you try and beat the current highscore which is OVER 9000 ?</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Long story short, did you know that:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>0+1 = 1\u00a0</strong>[\"<em>Really ? Thought we were that dumb?</em>\"]</p>\n<p>Alright, let's try something harder:</p>\n<p><strong>0*X = 0</strong>\u00a0[\"<em>Wow! Must have took you long to compute!</em>\"]</p>\n<p>Hmm, you seem to be pretty good huh? What about this smarty-pants:</p>\n<p><strong>X/0 = ?</strong>\u00a0[\"<em>That's not even possible you idiot!</em>\"]</p>\n<p>Oh yeah? But have you even tried? We did, and it causes an instantaneous rift in the space-time continuum! What about trying this by yourself on your ennemies?</p>\n<p>And, last but not least, you might want to take a look at this:</p>\n<p><strong>0-1 = null\u00a0</strong>[\"<em>Hum... NOPE!</em>\"]</p>\n<p>Whatever, we make the rules you fool! Bwahahahahaha...ah...ah..ahem, well. You're probably wondering what's the link between that and our game, well, here it comes:</p>\n<p>The gameplay is based on very basic mathematical concepts: to kill your ennemies you have to divide them (Since you play as a zero, you can guess how painful it must be!). But you can also earn new health points by multiplying them and thus create little zeries that will follow you and absorb damages for you. By now, the most attentive of you guys (and gals!) may have notice that two rules have been left out, well what fun would there be in spoiling everything just yet?</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed mechanics are written in the in game rules section. Default keyboard mode is Qwerty but it can be changed on the main menu, make sure to check that before you start.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Everything was made by us from scratch during the LUDUM DARE 45\u00a0.</strong></p>\n<p>The team is composed of two students (<strong>Ma\u00ebl Plantec</strong>\u00a0aka Sayanael who was the main artist but also developper, and <strong>Thomas Cazaubon</strong>\u00a0aka DjindeGames who was the main developper) in 5th year of computer engineering at the INSA of Toulouse (France).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:59:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e6a3a52da669c372dacf6e0c0ad77f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DjindeGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
