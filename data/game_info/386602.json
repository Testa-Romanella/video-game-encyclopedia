Anything you imagine, anywhere you dream, any time you envision - it can get you there. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave you ever wondered what the Handley-Page 42 looked like in real life? Or what size was a Messerschmitt Me-323 Gigant? Or Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria? All of them are long since gone, but with the incredible power of virtual reality they can be brought back to life. And this is what the VR Museum was created for. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are many great inventions that are only known from drawings and blurry photos. And many of them are already 3D-modelled and scattered around the net. The idea behind the VR Museum is to locate them, refurb if necessery, and show here for everyone to see. Starting from airplanes, the Museum's collection will grow to become more interdisciplinary in the future. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is going to be exciting!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDISCLAIMER: We don't have an HP-42, nor an Me-323, nor the Columbus' caravellas yet. Mind you: YET!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T02:16:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d49befb06eb64ccf593385bf69242ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CS-REPORTERS", "IM\u2022PRO\u2022VISION  Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CS-REPORTERS", "IM\u2022PRO\u2022VISION  Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
