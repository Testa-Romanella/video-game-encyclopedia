{"id": 301218, "slug": "spell-wheel", "name": "Spell Wheel", "name_original": "Spell Wheel", "description": "<p>A wacky broughlike made for the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge of\u00a02019.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><ul><li>Movement: WASD</li><li>Cast: Arrows</li><li>Spin: QE</li><li>Confirm: Enter</li><li>Mouse can be used on Augment menu</li></ul><p><strong>Synopsis:\u00a0</strong>Take Emmysaurus through 6 levels of THE PEN and use your SPELL WHEEL to battle everything from Jellies to Milk Bottles. Run for the exit or try to get a high score.</p><p>Your Spell Wheel has 4 spokes.\u00a0Cast in one of the cardinal directions to activate one spoke. Each power on the spoke corresponds to a tile on the map itself and they are activated in order until hitting walls.\u00a0Each power enhances the current spell and spells can branch into different paths, evolving independently.</p><p><strong>Vending Machines:\u00a0</strong>You can attack vending machines to get candy. Candy heals you or gives score if you are already full health. When the vending machine produces a piece of candy, you'll have to try twice as hard to get the next one but technically there is no limit.</p><p><strong>Tips below, but they are spoilery!</strong></p><p><strong>Spell power descriptions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Damage</strong>: adds 1 damage (the spell starts out with ZERO damage)</li><li><strong>Multipliers </strong>(2,3,5): multiplies the power of\u00a0 all spell effects previously added</li><li><strong>Poison</strong>: does 2 damage per turn.
