The main goal is to showcase going in and out of flock-behavior. On the code side of things, it utilizes a compute-shader\u00a0for some of the Boid-behavior\u00a0calculations.<br/></p>\n<p>This project is part of a wider learning process and\u00a0is largely based on this awesome\u00a0tutorial by Sebastian Lague (https://bit.ly/2WLRoCh). I\u00a0highly recommend you visit his YouTube channel as his work is fantastic and there is tons to learn!</p>\n<p>All feedback is welcomed and much appreciated!</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\nSimulation Controls\r\n<p>SPACE - Start the simulation (or just let it begin on its own...)</p>\n<p>P -\u00a0 Pause the simulation</p>\n<p>R -\u00a0\u00a0Let the Boids return home and go on a new Ride!</p>\n<p>T - Terminate the simulation\u00a0 and return to the main-title screen</p>\n<p>ESC - Exit application</p>\r\nCamera Controls\r\n<p>Q - Rotate clockwise</p>\n<p>E - Rotate anti-clockwise</p>\n<p>W - Recenter camera</p>\n<p>Z - Change your perspective and join the Ride!</p>\r\nBoid Controls\r\n<p>(for the more interventionist kind of gods out there...)</p>\n<p>A - Activate a Boid and send it on a path of destruction!</p>\n<p>S - Boid self-destruct...because sometimes the Ride is just too heavy!</p>\n<p>D - Deactivate a Boid and let it rejoin the Ride...</p>\n<p>(If you have joined in then these controls affect the particular Boid you're following.)</p>\n\r\nASSETS USED\r\n<p>The main 3D models used come from the original project by Sebastian Lague (https://bit.ly/2WQeR52)</p>\n<p>Glass shader:\u00a0 <em>MK Glass</em> - FREE (https://bit.ly/2UrZRZQ)</p>\n<p>VFX: <em>Epic Toon FX</em>\u00a0- PAID (https://bit.ly/33PEtkf)</p>\n<p>Main score: <em>Ride of the Valkyries</em>, Richard Wagner (From\u00a0<em>Die Walk\u00fcre</em>\u00a0of\u00a0<em>Der Ring des Nibelungen</em> opera cycle)</p>\n<p>Intro score:\u00a0<em>Orchestra Tuning</em> (https://bit.ly/39mfQwJ)</p>\n<p>Wind SFX: <em>Desert Simple</em> by\u00a0Proxima4 (https://bit.ly/3buvKGL)</p><p>Made with Unity.</p>\n\r\nWARNINGS\r\n<p>The simulation is about 5-minutes long...and time is precious!</p>\n<p>As it progresses there are more flashing lights, especially towards the end.
