I go to school but now I am on holidays.<br/>\r\nThe company where my parents work has moved to another city, so we had to move as well.<br/>\r\nRight from the moment we moved in the new house, I started to hear some strange sounds, and after a few days I began feeling that there was someone else in the house, and when looking out of the window, it seemed that I could see somebody\u2019s figure out there. It was a girl. <br/>\r\nAnd yesterday she left a present at our door. When I picked it up, she started following me. The next day, our neighbors told me that had been a girl who liked to come to that house and play hide-and-seek with those who lived there.<br/>\r\nToday my parents went to Mexico for a week, and I\u2019m gonna have to spend seven days alone in our new house.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c02/c020dc49908a0937df8a37b038cf3d14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 98, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kiddy", "The_Kiddy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kiddy", "The_Kiddy"], "esrb_rating": null}
