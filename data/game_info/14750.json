The store page will be changed soon to match our product instead of the old version from the old developers.<br/><br/><br/>I started making \"The Rebel\" an year ago with only two goals in mind:<br/><br/><strong>1. Create the game with the best graphics.<br/><br/>2. Create the game with the most fun gameplay. </strong><br/><br/>Literally just that. There is no big emphasis on the story, no experimentation. The Rebel is all about shooting, having fun and enjoying nice graphics. <br/><br/><strong>What is the game all about though?</strong> <br/><br/>Well in the rebel you're playing a character called Kano. The year is 2045 and you have to deal with corporation known as Magnus who have full control over the access to natural resources.<br/><br/>So, what can you do in the game, why the hell play it? <br/><br/>The game has number of features that I tried to make it stand out from other boring first person shooters. In other words, you will notice how the game feels as if you're playing with cheats all the time - getting killed is almost impossible, you start with 5 weapons loaded with many bullet magazines, you can do gigantic jumps - all this adds to your gameplay so you shouldn't just walk around \"armed\" with a useless pistol or hands and get bored to death. You can also drive a motorbike or even a flying car and also shoot your enemies while driving. <br/><br/>Is the game in its finished, final state? <br/><br/>Short answer: Yes. Long: No. The game is finished enough to be playable but there are features that I'd like to add but were impossible for me at the moment. Such as: multiplayer. Multiplayer will require dedicated server which costs money so if the game doesn't end in total failure and I get at least enough to buy some beer, I'd also pay for multiplayer servers in the upcoming months. I've been also considering adding Russian or French as an language and improving the graphics and the gameplay - all that will happen through the months for as long as the game promises to have some future. <br/><br/>Have fun :)<br/><br/>B.
