I am still developing and improving it so any feedback is welcome.</p>\n<p>With Koord Coach you can train your reflexes, cardio and coordination within one app / game. All events in the game happen randomly, ensuring that no two play sessions are the same, to make sure you stay on your toes.</p>\n<p>Koord Coach has three different game modes, each with two or more sub-modes:</p>\n<p>1. Block Incoming Objects - dodge or block game objects trying to hit you to score points.</p>\n<p>2. Endurance - touch game objects which appear around you before they disappear to score points.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 Cube activation - touch game objects when they become active to score points.</p>\n<p>Eight different difficulty levels and six game duration settings ranging from 30 seconds to five minutes allow you to tailor the game to your wishes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T06:54:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd473083056be9cfee4075c8230e0280.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["LordSlimeball"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
