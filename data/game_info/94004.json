So the teaser isn't that in-depth, but it successfully shows off the tone and the core features of the game.</p>\n<ul><li>A gorgeous art style that combines traditional animation techniques and nature photography.</li><li>Nonverbal dialog system; Tala is a wordless experience. All of the conversations that you have with the townsfolk are completely visual.</li><li>Interactive Environment; The game is about play as much as it's about exploration. Click on things in the environment and they'll animate! (Mostly in the Bakery scene in the demo, but the full release will have far more)</li></ul>\n<p>Follow the development on Twitter<em>.</em><br/><br/>The photography was all taken by me in national parks across Victoria, and weird little spots of nature around the suburbs of Melbourne. Some of it has been up mountains, from within fern gullies, &amp; a cool looking log near a school.\u00a0 Some of the national parks include Wilson's Promontory, The Grampians and the Dandenong Ranges<br/><br/>The photography, animation, game design &amp; development\u00a0were all done by me,\u00a0<strong>Matthew Petrak</strong>, from sounds\u00a0 were sourced online from a variety of places, and the music is\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>Cody Rueger</strong></p>\n<p><em>Made with\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f by<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/178/178035436932facbb5e2e82209568ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Petrak"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
