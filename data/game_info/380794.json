Gameplay is inspired by The Binding of Isaac and The Legend of Zelda.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGrashers began as a desire to make a game similar to what we loved, like The Legend of Zelda, Binding of Isaac, FTL, Megaman, and many more. We quickly found our own style, turning a simple roguelike prototype into a junk collection simulator in space, with radioactive monsters and interactive stories. Over time the game has evolved into something none of us had expected, making us proud to work on it every day.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T02:28:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b6032da0e925a1cb6c370be1e8a21fb2.jpg", "website": "http://www.grashers.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pink Array"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pink Array"], "esrb_rating": null}
