Prefabricated objects that have collision and physics enabled are spawned at the locations where the user clicks. Users can modify the type of prefabricated object spawned, as well as its size and rotation. Users can select four different types of prefabricated objects: a cube, a sphere, a long and thin rectangular prism, and a low-poly gargoyle statue. The gargoyle statue was something I modeled in Blender for a game jam last January. I was curious to see how it would function in the project I made and if I could even get it working at all. I added it in to satiate that curiosity, but found its presence enjoyable enough to warrant keeping. Having physics enabled on all the objects allow them to bump around and push each other, as well as simply fall. This simple feature can create a lot of fun when played around with. <br/></p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Display Mouse Position</li><li>Spawn Objects</li><li>Select Prefab</li><li>Select Size</li><li>Select Rotation</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T08:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb6115b7b65b2c24299b5158065f9d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Patchedjiev NJIT"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
