You've signed up for the animal breeder starter pack, your complimentary\u00a0island has arrived\u00a0and now they won't stop shipping you crates of animals! Apparently setting up a stable ecosystem is easy: keep the animals fed and they'll make more animals, something about food chains and starvation,\u00a0I don't know, this is a lot of reading. Just make sure there are enough animals to ship off again\u00a0and don't let anything go extinct on your island.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Drag crates onto the island to deliver that many animals. Animals will automatically look for food and breed periodically.\u00a0Gather enough to satisfy a shipping requirement on one of the boats, and then click on that boat to ship them off again. The food chain is randomised each time you play, so you'll need to figure out which animal eats what. You lose animal trust each time a species goes extinct on the island, so try to keep each species alive.</p>\n\n<p>Code by Dan Hines &amp; Samantha Keane</p>\n<p>Art by Ben Claxton &amp; Holly Briggs</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 49</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:27:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b90be7f826b691c10db110d751358b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrDanH"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
