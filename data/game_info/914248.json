Connect 2 - 6 controllers to your computer or laptop to each control a player. (I have found that wired connections to multiple PS4, Xbox, and third-party controllers is the easiest way to connect all controllers). Keyboard and mouse is supported but not recommended. Balance your character so their head doesn't touch the ground while shoving other players over! Landing a hit strengthens your player while making the hit player less balanced. Enjoy 6 Original Characters and 5 Homemade environments where you can duke it out. Additional features are in the works.\u00a0Like Gang Beasts meets Weeble Wobbles.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Analog\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-&gt; Move</p>\n<p>Right Analog\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-&gt; Tilt</p>\n<p>Top Button\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -&gt; Switch Character (character selection screen only)</p>\n<p>Left Button\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-&gt; Push</p>\n<p>Bottom Button\u00a0 -&gt; Jump</p>\n<p>Start Button\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -&gt;\u00a0Starts Game (character selection screen only)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T12:06:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f7/8f7ddcc018e91279dd42258b6101c751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LostSinner117"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
