Match three pill bottles according to specific rules and properties. Each bottle has a number of pills, a type of pill, and a color of pill. To make a set of bottles, all three of these bottles must have all three properties the same or all three completely different. The properties that match, the more points you get, and the more that differ, the more time you get. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/815/815840483b298093a7a042f7144a3c2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["indexware"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
