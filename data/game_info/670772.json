If I\u00a0could invest more work into this game, it would be in the maze generation algorithm - alas, here we are.</p>\n<p>Each time you fail a maze, 7 seconds are added onto your allowed time to give you a bit more space to complete the level. You have a total of 7 lives.</p>\n<p>Once you complete 7 mazes, your total time will be displayed, and the game will be over.</p>\n<p>A fairly simple game - it was written in pygame. The music was made by Nicole Marie T from here, and the art assets were clumsily made by me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:36:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9c/a9c12af7da5da48650950d2dd234babb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chrygore"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
