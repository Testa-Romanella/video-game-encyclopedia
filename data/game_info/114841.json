It's not really suitable for speedrunning itself as-is, but might be updated/etc at some point.  There's a lot that needs fixed, and there's very little in the way of level content (due to time constraints), but the general idea is here.</p><p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p><p>The controls are pretty simple:</p><ul><li>Left/Right arrow, or J/K keys:  Move left/right</li><li>Down arrow or K: Turn into sphere while held</li><li>Up arrow or I: Enter a door (or possibly other things...)</li><li>Z: Swing your sword, or when held down, run/roll faster</li><li>X: Jump</li></ul><p>When you're in sphere form, you can bounce!  But you're still a squishy ninja.  The only way to kill things is by using your sword.</p><p>Collecting food and killing enemies gives you points.  Every 1000 points, you get an additional life.</p><p><strong>Source</strong><br/></p><p>This was done for the Lisp Game Jam 2017.
