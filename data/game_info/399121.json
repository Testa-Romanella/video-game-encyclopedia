Its full of spaghetti code and looks like garbage, but I'm still kind\r\nproud of it, haha. I had a lot of fun making it. I learned a lot\r\nwhile making it, And I still go back and play it from time to time.\r\nThe old game maker site that it was uploaded to was taken down some\r\ntime ago. A few people have requested that I put it up so they can\r\nplay it, so hear it is. I fixed some of the bugs, but there are still\r\nplenty more in there, haha. I also added the source code for you to\r\nmess with if you like. You'll need a copy of Game Maker 8 or Game\r\nMaker Studio 1 to open the gmk files though.\u00a0I don't think I'll ever finish this\r\ngame, but it does have an end... kind of.\u00a0\u00a0if you collect all three peaces of the\r\ntriforce then go back to the old man,\u00a0he will congratulate you for finding\r\nthem.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:31:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a04c301ec35ebbe7411c1d4b52c53dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Taylor458"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
