I was a business school student and we had to prepare a lot for consulting job interviews.<br/>But most of the practice cases were boring and not entertaining. So I decided to create some fun ones.<br/>It was actually my most successful blog post:\u00a0<br/>[url]https://iesemba.com/2018/11/30/nasty-consultant-the-game/[/url]</p>\n<p>This year, I decided to turn it into a real video game!<br/>This is only a first draft version. I'm trying to see if there is an interest in these type of games and if the gameplay is entertaining enough.<br/>I have tons of ideas for other chapters and also to make the story longer.
