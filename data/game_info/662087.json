Here are some things you should know before downloading !\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>I - This student \u00a0project was made as a group of 6 people</strong> of the following fields:</p><ul><li>3*Game Designer</li><li>1*Developper</li><li>1*Game Artist,</li><li>1*Animator</li></ul>\n<p><strong>II - It was made with Unreal Engine 4.26</strong>\u00a0and took 2 month (roughly) to develop (prototype state). No code is involved, as we mainly used the blueprint system of UE4.</p>\n<p><em>NB : For now, the game might be very laggy on lower configurations, due to a lack of light optimization.</em></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>III - This prototype currently features :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a01 - A basic Random Item Generation System\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>The name of the item is related to its \"item traits\" composition and its rarity. It actually influences the character's attributes.</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a02 - Procedurally generated map layouts.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Unreal top-down view :\u00a0The big square is divided in 25 rooms, all of which are always accessible. Upon reaching the next level, the purple layout will always be different in order to create a sense of diversity regarding the level design.</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a03 - Full working main gameplay loop </strong>: <em>Killing monsters =&gt; Earning Exp/Finding\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Loot =&gt; Empower your character =&gt; reach level 100</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a04 - Difficulty Scaling with the player's level &amp; attributes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a05 - Basic fighting system</strong>, allowing you to :<em> Attack, Combo, Protect yourself,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Dash in/out.</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a06 -\u00a0 Lots of quality animations </strong>(altough there are still some missing or minor\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0blending problems).</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a07 - </strong><em><strong>NB : </strong>The current balancing of the game may not represent the final experience.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>IV - Main Rules of the Game :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Go for missions of increasing difficulty, clear all the monsters in a room to go to the next one.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The more room you clear without going back to the village, the more rewards you may earn,</strong> but be careful : You cannot heal while in battle, and you will loose all your possessions upon death ! How far can you go ?</p>\n<p><strong>V- All feedback is appreciated !\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Be aware that the current state of the game is only a fraction of what it could be. That being said, we would be greatful for any feedback, advice, or new ideas that you may have !</p>\n<p>Mostly, we hope you enjoy your experience and that you'll hope for some more!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T02:14:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abb/abb7988b6f4d3581ecb9772010cf0a56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["baobob", "Loukoum", "Rye Zero", "Damien_Mathiotte"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
