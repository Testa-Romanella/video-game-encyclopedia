{"id": 805606, "slug": "monopole", "name": "Monopole", "name_original": "Monopole", "description": "<p><em>Are magnetic monopoles real?</em> Explore the curious nature of attractive or repulsive\u00a0objects through a series of puzzles that requires skills and mindedness.</p>\n<p>This is my submission for the first LostRelicGames Jam. The theme was \"Connection\" and my idea was to create a small puzzle game where the main mechanic is to change the polarity of attractive or repulsive charges. The goal of each level is to join every monopole by finding the correct combination of polarity switching. Some intuition about their movement may be necessary to solve certain puzzles.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Press <strong>SPACE</strong> to change the polarity of all charges</li><li>If you get stuck you can reset the level by pressing <strong>R</strong></li></ul>\n<p>The game can also be played with a gamepad: <strong>X</strong>/<strong>A</strong> for changing polarity, <strong>SELECT</strong> to reset.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>The game was made using the Godot Engine (my first game with it!).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music must be credited as\u00a007 the nereids by\u00a0KarlH.
