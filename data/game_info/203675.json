I recently cleaned it up\u00a0<strong>a bit</strong> and added VR support for the Oculus Rift.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has oculus rift support and will automatically start in VR mode if a headset is connected (the oculus suite should be open when you launch it). Once executed It will also show up in your Oculus library. (I don't have an HTC vive so I can't say anything about that)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note that the version on the google play store is significantly different from the PC version as I have not updated it in a while. The game play is the same though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/027/027b422ae7cb5736e2af6fb24dea8f09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bigpumkin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
