They are both unwilling to play along in these traditional expectations of them, and after fleeing their own wedding they are now out on the open roads \u2013 on to new adventures in this gender flipped world!</em>\n\n<p>This Visual Novel game is a stand-alone sequel to the manga Sword Princess Amaltea, made by the Swedish manga artist Natalia Batista. The manga trilogy is published in USA, Sweden, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic and has also been made into a pen and paper RPG book. <br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Sword Princess Amaltea \u2013 The Visual Novel  </em></strong>lets you imagine a very different fantasy setting from the eyes of both Amaltea and Ossian, as the game has <strong>parallel story</strong> <strong>lines</strong> and makes you choose which one of them to follow!
