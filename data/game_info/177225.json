Watch out for the asteroids they throw at you. The Cosmos-7 is equipped with a matter capture emitter, capable of catching\u00a0 asteroids and throwing them back at enemies. Make sure to point the open end of the ship at incoming asteroids, and aim the forward end of the ship at enemies when the asteroid ejection triggers! The Cosmos-7 is also capable of several upgrades which change the way asteroids are ejected.\u00a0Our experts on Earth say that there is a dangerously massive monster floating deep in space known as the \"Big Mouth\".
