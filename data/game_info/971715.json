How can we harness his energy for a more constructive purpose?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIndeed, we plan to honor him by constructing a new empire in his name!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUtilize your Match 3 skills to build this magnificent empire. As always, you can also enjoy optional activities such as Spot the Difference challenges, Hidden Object scenes, Solitaire, and Mahjong.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor an added challenge, you can test your skills by competing against an artificial intelligence opponent in versus mode and take on High Difficulty bonus levels. In these levels, your objective is to collect all the coins while avoiding the black ones. Be cautious, as collecting a black coin will result in failure!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRemember, the bonus levels are entirely optional, so feel free to give them a try and skip if they seem too daunting or simply not to your liking.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-07T06:21:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/702/7025dfaf326b46711f98fb57beca8241.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/lgtsia", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LGT SIA"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LGT SIA"], "esrb_rating": null}
