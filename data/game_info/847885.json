These dominoes, positioned around a curve that leads downward, proceed to fall over onto a lever\u00a0and launch a smaller ball into the air. The smaller ball flies through the air and knocks over several more dominoes before rolling down into a container. The dominoes that it hits fall over, cascading uphill, launching another small ball into another container. The constraints for this project were that we were not allowed to use any code, and were supposed to create a machine by\u00a0only relying on the physics available to us through the Unity engine.\u00a0During this exercise,\u00a0I mainly focused on getting acclimated to and exploring the many different capabilities of Unity. One thing I struggled with while designing my solution for this exercise was understanding\u00a0the way hinges and levers worked within the physics engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T18:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/8895751ea9e842db179fa253cb6dcc72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ec3938"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
