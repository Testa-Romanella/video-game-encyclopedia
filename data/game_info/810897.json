{"id": 810897, "slug": "charlestown-jewish-cemetery-nevis", "name": "Charlestown Jewish Cemetery, Nevis", "name_original": "Charlestown Jewish Cemetery, Nevis", "description": "<p>This version was produced in 2018. We hope to create an updated version soon!<br/><br/>The Jewish Cemetery in Charlestown, Nevis is a truly unique heritage site. Within its current boundaries are the remains of numerous Jewish graves dating to the 17th and 18th centuries. There are 19 marked burials, and previous archaeological work suggests that as many as 44 additional unmarked burials may be present at the site. In partnership with the Nevis Historical and Conservation Society (NHCS) and researchers from the University of Florida, DHI has constructed a virtual version of the site to help share this valuable heritage resource with a wider audience. Our project began during the summer of 2015 when we mapped the site using a mix of digital and traditional surveying methods. This included the use of a digital total station to crate an accurate 3D map of the site.</p>\n\n<p>A series of photographs were taken of all extant graves for photogrammetry, and to create 3D versions of each crypt. These high-detail models were then simplified through a process known as \u201cretopologizing\u201d or \u201cdecimating\u201d where low poly/lightweight versions of each model are manually produced. These low poly versions are less complex and require fewer system resources. This means the final virtual world will run smoothly on a wider range of equipment/computers.</p>\n<p>Additional landscape elements were created, including the cemetery\u2019s ground surface (from total station data), walls, and so forth. Roads and buildings were constructed to anchor the cemetery in virtual space. The surrounding landscape and features are stylized versions based on nearby structures, and not exact replicas of the site\u2019s context. The virtual world was constructed with Unity 3D.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T07:47:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76c/76c4d129fa6c1d878e1c795b4472a232.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Heritage Interactive"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
