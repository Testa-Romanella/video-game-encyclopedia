With a wisp of wonder and fear on what you will find as no playthrough will ever be the same. <em>Thus it is highly recommended you play through more then once</em><em>.</em>\u00a0The game will start as if your falling asleep, you're mind beginning to relax, falling into a deep slumber till you're thoughts begin to bloom and wander. Forming countless possibilities and ideas- But with everyone, day soon arrives and those thoughts become distorted as your mind slowly awakes till eventually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You're dream fades away.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Except you may never awake.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em>The game is heavily inspired by a dream from one of my friends with a little added on-top to give it more of a gameplay loop. Developed in just over\u00a0a week. Me, and those who helped both inspire and develop this idea hope you enjoy the experience.</em></p>\n<p><em>For those who liked the music the songs can be listened too\u00a0here!</em></p>\n<p>https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_RqDDvLB2d1KKK9hFOH6f-SN9t-efMzf</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T10:26:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f6/9f67a22e3cde3743d727ca1fe71a31fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Puppet Mini-Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
