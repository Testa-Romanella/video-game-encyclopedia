It was published by Activision in 1981.</p>\n<p>One or two players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to \"get to the other side.\" Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted. The chickens are only allowed to move up or down. A cluck sound is heard when a chicken is struck by a car.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1981-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/257/25775b3425b15aa051671094a534b8ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Atari 2600"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": null}
