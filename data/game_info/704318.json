It\u2019s a constant joy just to stare at, with the most amazing creature designs throughout. It\u2019s all hand-drawn, then animated, then given even more depth with superb sound effects.\"</p>\n<p>John Walker on Buried Treasure</p>\n<p><em>\"Slice of Sea\u00a0 \u00a0</em>is subtly stunning. The hand drawn animations are lively and constantly moving in a lifelike, mesmerizing fashion. It\u2019s hard to tell if the scenes are above ground or below the water\u2019s surface at times, but I\u2019d say that makes it all the more enchanting. There is so much excitement and detail going on in each scene that every environment feels new, no matter how many times you\u2019ve walked through it. Paired with an ambient but expressive soundtrack that serves to heighten the entire experience,\u00a0<em>Slice of Sea\u00a0</em>looks and sounds spectacular.\"</p>\n<p>Heather Johnson Yu on Hey Poor Player<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T13:22:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d8908fc3afd9ea4b5b7036549ff73a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 468, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mateusz Skutnik"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
