{"id": 974201, "slug": "the-nefargad", "name": "The Nefargad", "name_original": "The Nefargad", "description": "You've been abducted completely defenseless from your home and brought to a dungeon. You have no idea who did this to you or why. You must find your way out of this dungeon, where you were forcibly brought, by solving puzzles. Luckily, there have been others before you who came into this dungeon to explore it. They have previously solved the mysteries you now have to solve, and left notes about the solutions. With these notes, you can progress more efficiently. Thanks to the left messages, you will also learn about what happened here before you, but you are determined not to trust anyone.<br/><br/><strong>Dynamic Tension and Horror</strong><br/>The dungeon seems to respond to your every move. Sometimes it might feel like someone is watching you. If you\u2019re not using your torch, you should extinguish it. Staying in the darkness for too long might not be a good idea either. You must balance the dark and light well. Also, don\u2019t forget that puzzles may sometimes have alternative solutions. Random and unpredictable events will make the experience in this dungeon unique and irreplicable!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Your Knowledge, Insight, and Patience Will Be Tested</strong><br/>As you progress, the fundamental mechanics of the puzzles in the dungeon will change. Sometimes your knowledge about a subject will be tested. Sometimes how you approach problems will be examined. When you can\u2019t find a solution, you will test your patience through trial and error!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Multilayered Story</strong><br/>As you progress through the dungeon, you will not only write your own story but learn about the stories of the researchers who entered this dungeon before you. What happened to those researchers? Did they share the same fate as you? Were they brought here forcibly? Were they able to get out? This dungeon is ready to tell you all this and more!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Warnings</strong><br/>The Nefargad includes profanity and slang in its game content. <br/>The Nefargad contains flashing and/or rapidly blinking lights in both game content and promotional materials.
