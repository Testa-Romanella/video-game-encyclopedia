Play as Ravenna and try to outrun (your lover) Sydney for as long as you can!</p>\n<p>There were a lot more things I wanted to do with this game. Write dialogue that actually led to some form of development, for example. Give them more than just one expression on their sprites. Find a way to make the game stop lagging. I'm too tired now though.</p>\n<p>This was my first time making an action\u00a0 game so there are a lot of mistakes. For one thing, I'm pretty sure it's impossible to get all the dialogue in one go. The bullets are merciless. And I didn't program them to actually let people live so uh... Good luck with that. If you can already beat my meager high score of 2377, you honestly already beat the game.</p>\n<p>Source Code:\u00a0[x]</p>\n<p>Dev notes/commentary:\u00a0[x]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b153c243639c99c8b57f8c04b72f1a84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hanmori"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
