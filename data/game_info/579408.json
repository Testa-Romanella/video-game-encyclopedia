Your lamp runs on oil and slowly drains over time but you can refuel it by hitting the refueling button on the table. There are also events that increase how fast the oil burns such as a sprinkler going off or a breeze blowing in, you can protect the lamp from both of these but you have to focus on it to do so. The game ends when either the lamp burns out or the timer finishes, the lamp going out counts as a loss, and the timer finishing counts as a win and will show you how many questions you got correct.</p>\n<p>Can you find the balance between looking at your surroundings and keeping the flame alive?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T08:40:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ec93d1a3c905b897b09d66e5f550a93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Last Minute Men"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
