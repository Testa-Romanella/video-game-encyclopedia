Featuring three different game modes, Crystal Crush will engage you with music, skill, and a bit of luck. The premise is simple: you are in control of Crystals in a column with a press of a button. Match 3 or more in the target row (at the bottom, just above the buttons) to score! Multiple matches in a row increase your score multiplier for even more points! <br/><br/>==Arcade Mode== <br/>Advance through 40 levels to match predetermined sets of Crystals. Watch out though, match a bomb and it will blow up! Match too many bombs and the game is over. <br/><br/>==Timed Mode== <br/>Score as many points as you can before the clock runs out! Use Power-ups to increase your score or add time to the clock. Can you beat your high score? <br/><br/>==Crush Mode== <br/>How long can you go? Choose your moves carefully and plan ahead in this \"Endless\" mode and see how many points you can get! <br/><br/>Crystal Crush is a Universal app so it supports iPad/iPad 2, Retina displays, as well as iPhone and iPod devices. It also has Game Center Leaderboards for each mode with local and online achievements to show off your skill.  <br/><br/>Please let us know what you think of our first App!<br/><br/>http://twinhalogames.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T03:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c53062e53ae0a436a005344111f58d.jpg", "website": "http://twinhalogames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Thomas Saint Thomas"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Thomas Saint Thomas"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
