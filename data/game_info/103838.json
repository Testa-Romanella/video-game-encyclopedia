It should be easy, although it's been a long time I didn't do it myself, so who knows? For example, the mouse no longer worked and I had to quickly patch keyboard to control pointer. Just use arrow keys, X and C. Hope I didn't mess things up. Coding is strange: you let everything for a while and when you're back, it's like functions have started a life of their own and nothing works like it used to be. Oh well.</p>\n<p><em>The game runs at 60 fps, which is a bit demanding for the web player.
