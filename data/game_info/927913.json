Blast, stomp, and smash your way through a office-disguised gang hideout to take down the leader. Stomp heads, crack skulls, and smash doors in a brilliant die-and-retry loop to rack up the highest combo, and the highest score possible.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD, MOUSE -</strong> Move, look around</p>\n<p><strong>M1 - </strong>Use weapon</p>\n<p><strong>M2 -</strong> Pick up/Throw weapon (based on whether you are holding a weapon already.</p>\n<p><strong>E -</strong> Kick</p>\n<p><strong>SPACE -</strong> Dash (you'll need it)</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note: This game is a demo/concept game. The challenges that go into creating a FPS Hotline Miami were ones I could not have foreseen.
