It's an endless runner, jump early [space] but you'll fall anyways because the jump mechanics are buggy (intended? who knows...)!</p>\n<p>Made for Kenney Jam, the theme was <em>It's a feature, not a bug!</em></p>\n\n\n<p>What a weekend. While I had a lot of fun, I didn't really make anything cool haha :)</p>\n<p>I actually worked on\u00a0<br/>THREE\u00a0<br/>small projects this weekend.\u00a0<br/>I struggled an incredible amount with the theme and just couldn't figure out what to make D:</p>\n<p>The first day/night I created a fishing game. With no end :P But you can catch fish to make money, and spend money to throw bait and attract more fish.</p>\n\n<p>The second night, I took a road generator I made last December and tried to make a car drive around it. It almost worked, but then I knew I wouldn't have time to finish after sleeping in too late...</p>\n\n<p>So at noon on Sunday, with inspiration from a game called Endless Lake, I started this endless runner... Because I figured it would be short enough to finish by the end of the jam :D I put about 4 hours into this one!</p>\n<p>Jump early!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70c3c7f2bc5a4a55578ef66d6450824a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rainbee2214"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
