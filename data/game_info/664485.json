For each \u201ccell\u201d on the 3D grid, there are states. For each game tick, the cell checks its neighbors\u2019 states to decide its own in the next tick. The fascinating fact about those cells is that every cell follows the same rules and have the same states. Through minor altercations on the initial states, the player can receive vastly different outcomes. The player might even bump into structures that can do basic Boolean calculations. Everything seems to be chaotic yet they are all governed by the same rule, under which they form magnificent patterns.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T05:36:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/018/01848b6a4912221bacf25c86498e5655.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["allenxch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
