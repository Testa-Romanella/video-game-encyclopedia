This game is only for the most experienced of critically-thinking Minesweeper players, so if that's not you, then turn back now. This bad boy features everything you'd expect from a version of Minesweeper for the elite few, and so much more. So buckle up, because you're in for the most intense puzzle night of your life...<br/><br/></p>\n<p>*Note: After heavy consideration, I have decided to add an Easy Mode for those less-adept players to have a chance at clearing a board or two. It will never be the same experience as the original intended difficulty, so I highly encourage you to try that first, and only to switch to the newly added difficulty if you find yourself struggling too much.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T06:42:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c47/c4735e7d5343fe90f3773980cb0e6292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GEG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
