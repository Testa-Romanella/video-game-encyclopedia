Well too bad - here's a Comedy Noir Romance for your consideration.</p><p>This is a tweaked re-realease of my entry for Ludum Dare 35: Shapeshift.<br/> <br/>You play as Kenneth Rice; a 130-year-old hard-boiled detective with sensibilities firmly in the 1920s era from when he was bitten by a vampire. Yes. <br/> <br/>When he gets a call from a mysterious stranger with a missing necklace, Kenneth steps up to the challenge; using his detective skills and vampiric transformation powers to solve the case. And maybe fall in love? <br/> <br/>In short, it's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night with more 20's lingo and homoerotic overtones. Enjoy! <br/> <br/></p><ul><li>Character artwork by Lyn-Dae Stewart</li><li>Script, coding and photoshopping by Nathan Blades.\" </li><li>Game music by Thomas Collins (vicegripsismyhero@outlook.com) and Kevin MacLeod (http://incompetech.com). </li><li>Sound effects from freesound.org. </li><li>Kenneth Rice: Vampire Detective was made in Ren'Py!
