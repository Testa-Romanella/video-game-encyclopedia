{"id": 447779, "slug": "boot-hill", "name": "Boot Hill", "name_original": "Boot Hill", "description": "<p>A classic one or two-player western gunfight game. Each player uses a small joystick to move their cowboy up and down the play area, while a second, much larger joystick is used to aim the pistol and shoot - this larger stick also has a trigger button. The game&#39;s single goal is to shoot the other player situated on the opposite side of the game area with the allocated 6 bullets. Wagons move up the middle and cacti litter the play area, both providing temporary cover from the opponent&#39;s gunfire and disintegrate when shot. The player may play against the machine or another person in two player mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1977-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-24T10:57:25", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Midway Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Midway Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
