Developed and published by Electronic Arts, it was released for PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox game consoles. It is the fourth Bond game which is not based on a film or book in the James Bond series, following James Bond 007: The Duel, James Bond 007 and EA&#39;s own 007 Racing. The game&#39;s story arc continues in the following sequel, Nightfire, released a year later. Unlike previous Bond games which featured the likeness of then current Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, Agent Under Fire used the voice of Adam Blackwood and the likeness of English actor Andrew Bicknell for Bond.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-02T22:55:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fdb/fdb8bdd5c4844da97853b7fc28d403d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.52, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 21, "beaten": 24, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 15, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 25, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 21, "reviews_count": 25, "platforms": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Visceral Games", "Electronic Arts Redwood Shores"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
