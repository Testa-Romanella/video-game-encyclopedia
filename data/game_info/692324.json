Supposed to make a game in 3 hours. Made a bad decision and decided to marathon the whole thing in one go, overshot by an hour. Oh well.</p>\n<p>The game is just about a guy who really needs his pills. Is he drug addict? Is he sick? I don't know, you decide. Your only objective is to get that man his pills.</p>\n<p>Game jam theme was \"life line\", I took this definition:\u00a0a thing on which someone or something depends or which provides a means of escape from a difficult situation.</p>\n<p>[A] - Move left</p>\n<p>[D] - Move right</p>\n<p>[E] - Interact</p>\n<p>[R] - Restart</p>\n<p>[TAB] - Open inventory</p>\n<p>[ESC] - Exit game</p>\n\n<p>Note: You can interact with literally anything in the game world.</p>\n<p>Note 2: I noticed some bugs with dialog text centering. But with respect to the game jam's time limit, I will only fix them after the jam is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T10:26:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/629/62977802e982e5068d94b1c514c486ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["deadlocust"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
