Also, your experience will be vastly enhanced by installing this free font. </p><p>If you play the games and enjoy them, let me know. You can contact me on twitter @metalsnail or on My Tumblr. Let me know your high score too!</p><p>Music was made using Drum Circle. Sounds were made using Bfxr.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/284/284d494e37c9ec6b3f91a3d19066495a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["metalsnail"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
