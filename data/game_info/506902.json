You are the fastest bubble popper in the world and by fastest I mean your speed. In the original games you are super slow and that would make it tricky for you to get out of sticky situations BUT... In this game you are like the flash (super fast) and that puts you in more sticky situations! Made with Unity. Background music from PlayOnLoop.com. Also on this version there is a 2 player multiplayer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T07:51:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a48/a48f3db913c7716fa9bdfc37f8d12bb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DjNinja studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
