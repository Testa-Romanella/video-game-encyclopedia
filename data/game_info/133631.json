However, with something lurking in the woods attracted to the light from your phone, this might not be so easy....\u00a0</p>\n<p>We had a lot of fun working on this game \u2014 it's only our second game overall, and our first time working with Unity. The software being unfamiliar to us, we hit a lot of snags along the way \u2014 one of the biggest being that the in-game text is pretty hard to read, a problem that didn't present itself until it was too late to fix. For a mostly text-based game that's a pretty bad snag, and something we would have definitely addressed had we had more time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, we think we put in a valiant effort and we hope you'll give the game a try....! Any feedback is greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Big thanks,<br/>Mei and Fred\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Update Log:</p>\n<p>26.04.18</p>\n<p>- Changed variables to give players more time to use the phone app and lessen the chance of an attack<br/></p>\n<p>- Improved graphics of phone app to make it readable</p>\n<p>- Changed a sound effect</p>\n<p>- Fixed some bugs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/deae6543f62562e7ffea93ab5ba65993.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["OAI"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
