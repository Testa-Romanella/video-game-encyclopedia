All you need to do is drag the figures onto the playing area.\u00a0 Thats all.\u00a0 Oh, yes, i also added a little more freedom for choose position, a few new figures, removed the timer, and did something else. I do not remember that. Play and learn everything yourself!<br/>Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9aa/9aa003999856ebbe000ed34aea3b8c15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["idasik96"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
