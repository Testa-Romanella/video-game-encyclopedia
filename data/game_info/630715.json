Something has descended onto the forest - something incomprehensible, sinister, slithering in from a crack in reality. It\u2019s up to you to get everybody home.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore a lushly atmospheric pixelated world, guiding your Daps through a permeable realm on the border between dreaming and waking. Encounter otherworldly horrors, interdimensional entities, and gods that have no business being worshipped.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Band together to solve puzzles and fight off hellish threats. The more Daps you gather, the stronger the pack will become, but beware: Daps are not immune to infection. Linger too long in the wrong place and the pack will turn on itself, with horrific consequences.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ascend to the spirit world and tend your garden there, taking a much needed break between levels. Meanwhile down on the ground, you\u2019ll need to scavenge and craft in order to survive. Use every resource available to survive an existential ordeal.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T02:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c086ee2236d61946da83cb66b43da8e1.jpg", "website": "https://meltingparrot.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 389, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Melting Parrot"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Melting Parrot"], "esrb_rating": null}
