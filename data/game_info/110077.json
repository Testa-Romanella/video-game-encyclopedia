This skill-based arcade action game wickedly twists together \"Where's Waldo\", classic snake game, and optical illusions. There are ten levels - ten different snakes to feed for snacktime.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>(The screenshots don't do the game justice - everything is in motion and in flux in the game.)</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for CGAJam, a game jam where games must be purely in a 4-color CGA palette and use 8-bit chiptunes for audio/music. Check out my other #CGAJam game also: Where Seldom is Heard<br/></p>\n<p>The game jam themes used are:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Always Faster: </strong>With each level, you control a faster and more maneuverable snake.</li><li><strong>History Repeats: </strong>Snakes from previous levels repeat the movements you used when you played those levels. The mouse also repeats the same movements it performed in previous levels. </li></ul>\n<p><em>Tip: follow the previous snakes to know where the mouse will be. The blood splatters are where the mouse has previously died. Wait there and let the mouse come to you</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Steer Snake Counterclockwise/Clockwise: </strong>Hold Left and Right Arrow keys, or A and D keys.</li><li><strong>Jump:</strong> Spacebar</li><li><strong>Restart game:</strong> R key</li><li><strong>Quit: </strong>Escape key</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Unity, Blender, BeepBox, Gimp, Audacity.</p><p>Video playthrough courtesy of Alpha Beta Gamer.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36f/36f74b8d4a1d32436b7e2ef4d59e757d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["andyman404"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
