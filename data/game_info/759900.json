Right now, it only features the first act, but more will be coming soon.</p>\n<p>This is a solo-dev project. Everything was made by me with no remade assets. There's no music and\u00a0no sfx, so don't go expecting a polished experience.\u00a0I wanted to make this just so I could prove to myself I could actually make a visual novel. I've never used Ren'Py before, so if something doesn't work, please let me know.</p>\n<p>The final version will be done (fingers crossed) before the end of the submission period, so please keep your eyes peeled!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T13:44:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/115/1151008aaca1ceb11e81496e0cc4a365.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Astral Dragon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
