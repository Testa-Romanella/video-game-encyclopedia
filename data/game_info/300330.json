As you run and jump through this endless world, you can choose to lay an egg, eat the egg you laid or even hatch the egg and start a family.</p>\n<p>Eating your eggs makes you younger, allowing you to play for longer. If you choose to hatch eggs, your offspring can then be appointed as a successor. You can continue your journey until you either die of old age, or run out of successors. Your offspring learn and acquire 'traits' every time you perform a particular action. These traits can then be passed to their offspring in turn and the cycles continue. These may affect your speed, egg laying potential as well as jump height. What kind of eggventure do you want to have?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e4135e2d07bfadbcbc62fe5415c950ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BluR", "SoMuch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
