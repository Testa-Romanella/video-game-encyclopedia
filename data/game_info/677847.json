Refusing to stay trapped  in hell, you decide to escape hell. Unfortunately for you, there is only  one way to do that--delve through the circles of hell and kill the  devil. He who kills the devil will gain the power to escape hell! Armed  with only a firehose and your wits, you'll face all sorts of monsters  and minions the Devil sends at you. You'll die again and again, kill  minions over and over, and drench your foes in brutal fashion on your  runs to\u00a0conquer hell.\u00a0\r\n    </p>\n<p><em><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>This  current build is an early demo of the final product which will  eventually be released to Steam.
