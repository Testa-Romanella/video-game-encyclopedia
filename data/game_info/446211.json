I am exploring the concept of replay-ability and how to use procedural techniques to generate new outcomes through player choices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The concept revolves around a banquet held in the King's throne room/reception hall. The King likes to keep the members of his court pitted against each other. This sometimes leads to villainous acts. The player takes on the role of King's Agent. Your duty is to sow discord and unrest among the members of court. While your character is not an assassin, their actions can lead to a noble's untimely end. How you choose to play will determine the outcome. Playing through multiple times will lead to different endings.<br/></p><p>If you do play my game, please take a moment to leave me some feedback:<br/></p><p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cby9SceBRL1yo1ASGgD_sZAv1lE-VoUZJAhO3aPg--Q<br/></p><p>Thank you so much!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T05:27:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/345/3455b879f2c7c0e1cbf47b1902dac861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zen of Thieves"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
