God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you.\u201d</em></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Backrooms: Nightmare</strong> is just another backrooms survival horror game that takes place in an infinite maze of rooms known as <strong>The Backrooms</strong>. Throughout the game, your goal is to survive the unknown nature of <strong>The Backrooms</strong>, using the items that you can find in different levels to fight the entities and survive.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Backrooms: Nightmare</strong> currently has 3 Levels, but more will be added in the future. For every 1000 downloads I\u2019m going to add a new level to the game. Features such as <strong>Sandbox </strong>and <strong>Multiplayer </strong>are expected to be added at more stable stages of the game, although Sandbox mode is more likely to be added first. There will be events in which you guys are going to choose a new level/sub-level or even a level that you created yourself, to be added to the Sandbox mode.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>!!THERE IS COPYRIGHTED MUSIC IN GAME.
