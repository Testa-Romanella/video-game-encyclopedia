{"id": 292045, "slug": "astro-claw-game-jam-version", "name": "Astro Claw (Game Jam Version)", "name_original": "Astro Claw (Game Jam Version)", "description": "<p>Astro Claw is an arcade space game inspired by asteroids, where the player controls a robotic claw attached to a space ship with damaged thrusters. Navigate through a field of magnetic asteroids that push and pull each other (and you) and avoid further damaging your ship. Collect energy to maintain your life support systems and survive as long as you can.</p>\n<p>This game was made as a submission for the Wowie Jam (https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam)! It subscribes to the theme that everything interacts with everything, and as such has a unique set of behaviors for how each object interacts physically with others. Every object has a different polarity and this changes the way that each object pushes and pulls others.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T05:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/089/089576f2d25b191704d52385e27918b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["River Forge Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
