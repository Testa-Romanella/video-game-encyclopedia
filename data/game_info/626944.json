I forgot to set a color with the dialog and the system will break. I am using two list to draw a group of dialog, one list for text, one list for color of the text. For that poster I added new text in the text list, but I forget to update the color list; it is an easy fix but no matter how small the update is, an update is an update.</p>\n<p>You can see a check item icon on interactable object, but the invisible object also display item icon even if they are not diractly interactable by player input. This is because the check item icon is an object itself and the instance create event have\u00a0inherited from the parent object, where I forgot to over write the event in the child object. Also a simple fix, but again any update is an update.</p>\n<p>the object layer for bullet is incorrectly under the background light layer. I was so focus on the other parts and only found it out after the submition...</p>\n<p>if you jump towards a block 45 degree(from bottom right to top left), there is a small chances that the tip of the\u00a0character will stuck in that block. Haven't try to jump from 135 degree, didn't have enough time to test it, nor time to fix it... but you can easily escape with a left click gun shot.</p>\n<p>Just found out we don't really need to submit the project source together...but since it is already there, I just gona leave it there if anyone want to check the code\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:30:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/638/63864959943871fd808510c7771f5aab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KTgodgod"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
