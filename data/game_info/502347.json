Otherwise you forfeit and your opponent wins.</li><li>The first ball sunk becomes that player's color.</li><li>A legal shot involves hitting a ball of your color first, and not sinking the wrong color, white ball or black ball (except when you're supposed to).</li><li>A free ball is awarded to the other player after a \"foul\". A free ball means you get a free second shot even if you don't sink a ball - as long as your shot was legal.</li></ul>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it.\r\nIf you're curious, you can see the development progress in\u00a0this Twitter thread.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T03:46:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecd35d77c8b9ffec61df3c4e3cf329fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Tom Mulgrew"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
