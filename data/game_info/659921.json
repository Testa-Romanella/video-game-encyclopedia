This presented many interesting technical problems to solve. I had a really fun time with this jam and learned<strong> A LOT</strong> more about Godot in the process.<br/><br/>Controls: <br/>- Up/Down arrows or W/S for menu selection<br/>- Enter/Space for menu confirmation<br/>- Arrows or WASD for movement<br/>- R to restart a level<br/>- ESC to return to menu (WARNING this will not save your progress and you will have to start the game over)<br/><br/>Things I wished I'd had the time to do/add:<br/>- Low-vision mode/assistance (this entire game is unfortunately identified by color and I did not have time to go through and add accessibility options)<br/>- More levels<br/>- 2 or 3 more mechanics to allow more complex levels<br/>- Improve door system so that there could be multiple to unlock in a single level<br/>- Levels that were bigger than the screen (this was a decision that was made to save time)<br/>- Some SFX and Music would have been nice too</p>\n\n<p>Feedback:<br/>- I'd love to hear what you thought of the game and anything you think would be a great addition.
