Set in a fantasy world you play a floating stone creature on a journey to find where your other stone creature friends are going.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Along the path, entering lights will cause you to lose control. You must move objects to create shadows that you can then pass through.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Made as my first game it should take roughly 2-3 hours to beat (the preview being about 20-30 minutes); however, there are more secrets to discover. The game should be ready 2021.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT !</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Due to the nature of this smaller build the save system does not work, this includes save slots and saving settings across sessions. Rest assured it will work in the full release.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>The resolution option will present numerous instances of the same resolutions</strong></li><li><strong>Controller not fully supported</strong></li><li><strong>Currently only on display 1</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Feedback Survey</strong></p>\n<p><strong>https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y67QFKQ</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mail List (+<em>Wallpapers</em>)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>https://mailchi.mp/e174a309eae2/umbra-journey-home-mail-list</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Umbra twitter for images, gifs and updates</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>https://twitter.com/playumbra</strong></p>\n<p><strong>My personal twitter\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>https://twitter.com/sir_wray</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T04:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e58/e58ed04e1c72a682601eab318c19b640.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Wray"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
