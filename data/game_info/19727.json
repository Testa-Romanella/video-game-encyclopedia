Game modes include Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. The action is fast, and luckily, so are the respawns. Up to 24 players per room makes for a kill frenzy! Use your rocket launcher to blow open secret passageways or to block off access. There are currently <strong> 6 8 </strong> different sprawling maps to cater to multi-player mayhem \u2013 each with their own distinct advantages and tactical requirements. Keep your friends close, and opt for a round of Team Deathmatch. Or truly keep your enemies closer, and trust no one in an all out every-man-woman-and-child-for-themselves game of true Deathmatch \u2013 where no one is safe from that grenade you just heard getting primed. <br/><br/>The <strong>new Capture The Flag mode</strong> is CTF with a twist. Your team gets points for capturing the flag as well as blowing away the enemy!<br/><br/>New Features, Achievements, and Maps are currently in the works, and regular updates are planned leading up to the full release of <strong>Second Coming: The Annakazi Invasion!</strong><br/><br/>Don't forget to vote for <strong>Second Coming:The Annakazi Invasion</strong> also here on <strong>Greenlight </strong>- http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=235945780", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T16:05:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12ccec81ccf0aebd07cb6b44e149df76.jpg", "website": "http://modernparadisegames.com/index.php/devblogs/sc-tt-development-blog", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 430, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Modern Paradise Media"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Modern Paradise Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
