Shops are scattered around the dungeon; don't forget to make use of them! Not all ground is safe: beware lava, chilly water and slime - which can kill you if you step in them too much. The dangerous ground exists in battle too, so if you can lure your foes into it, so much the better. Just don't step in it yourself!</p>\n<p>The game's manual is built right in - once you've launched the game, go to the Help menu and choose \"Manual\" to view it. Help on what all the objects do is also provided in the same menu.</p>\n<p>Gemma features a form of New Game+:\u00a0once you take the Boss down, you get a reward, and get to do the dungeon dive all over again with that bonus permanently with you. You can also rebirth your character at this time, if you'd like, by changing races / classes / etc.</p><p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f5/1f5681c52c5c8a437bae8924091a3fd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["World Wizard 89"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
