Bruiserweight Classic is an easy to play game where players are trying to discard all of the cards in their hand first. Whatever cards you have left over convert to damage taken to your guts! Players to hit zero hit points are kicked out of the game because, well, they're knocked TF out.</p><p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p><ol><li>Players are each dealt a hand of 9 cards.</li><li>On your turn you check the current Momentum (ascending or descending). If the Momentum is ascending, you must play a card equal to or higher than the current card in play. If the Momentum is descending, you must play a card equal to or lower than the current card in play.</li><li>You may also play a card exactly 5 different from the current card in play in any direction. Example: if there is a 7 in play, you may play a 2 or a 12 regardless of Momentum.</li><li>To flip the Momentum, draw a card or play a card that is the same as the card in play.</li></ol><p><strong>Number of players</strong>: 2 to 4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b9/2b9ade1e73b1e3815418cf5f52469e3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Alexander Shen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
