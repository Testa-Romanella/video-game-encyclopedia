Today, I was in a meeting at the dayjob with the marketing department, getting harangued by the events staff to travel for a week and exhibit on behalf of the company. I've worked remotely for the past six months due to, among other things, a growing agoraphobia, doctor verified, and occupational health work plan assisted, backed by the disability act's requirement for reasonable adjustments in the workplace, which they well know about. I thought about this poem, and made this during that meeting, smiling and declining their invitation. One day I'll love to travel again, but I'm damned if it'll be to a conference centre. I miss the beach. But at least I'm on my arse today.\u00a0</p>\r\n(\u203f\u02e0\u203f)\r\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T15:34:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96b33db85d9cb44473cb616cf77747b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dancehall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
