This is an old mining town that was famous for mining minerals. Most of all, Tektite was mined there, they say it has some kind of paranormal properties, but these were just rumors to attract customers up to a certain time. Recently, miners have been actively disappearing there, and subsequently some strange creatures similar to humans began to climb out of it. They were determined to aggressively destroy everything around and it was decided to cordon off the place. Now this city is surrounded by mercenaries, explored and just those who are hungry for profit. In this mine, things began to appear that had not been issued before, which is why they attracted a lot of collectors. The cost of such outlandish things with various effects can go beyond all mental chapels. <br/>Because of the abundance of rumors and good rewards, you, as an adventurer, came to this town to get rich. These mines are very dangerous and impassable for most people. How far can you go? Or maybe you can find out why these scary monsters appeared in the local mines in the first place? Their appearance is not natural and is very mysterious. Maybe all of this ....<br/><br/>This game is a 3-person RPG with a race system.
