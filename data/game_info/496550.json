The RPG is A Crucible for Silver (https://skyorrichegg.itch.io/a-crucible-for-silver). The system allows for a single DM/GM to create and distribute items (as the Host) and for up to ten players to connect and manipulate their own inventories (Join/Client).\u00a0If you are just testing locally you can simply run one copy of the game in Host and run others in Join/Client without touching any of the options.</p>\n<p>The zip also includes a save game to see how things work and several templates for various items that you can load.\u00a0</p>\n<p>FULL INVENTORY is completely TCP based.\u00a0You must run a Host first for the Join/Clients to work. The Host does not currently do UPnP so you may have to enable\u00a0 port-forwarding if you are testing beyond locally.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cde84aaea87e8a5409bc7a1f113dfe10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EadmarkGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
