Your character can only move forward, left or right during your turn. The enemies can only move backwards, left or right during enemy turn. Coming into contact with any enemy results in defeat.</p>\n<p>The goal is to obtain crystal shard on each level to progress further. Once a shard is obtained, you can activate the \"Invert\" power (once per crystal) by pressing the \"i\" key. This inverts the player and enemy movement i.e. the player character could only move backwards, left or right while the enemy could only move forward, left or right. This could be used to get out of a potential death situation.</p>\n<p>You can use mouse buttons to pan, rotate and zoom camera.</p>\n<p>Created by Abhishek Sati using Unity.</p>\n<p>I recommend playing the downloadable versions for optimal experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T04:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/426ced26c0d3ce08be53007fc6a33bd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Yozaak"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
