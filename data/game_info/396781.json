So, if anyone figures that out, hit me up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe year is 1999. The underground culture of the nineties is coming to an end. It is being replaced by a corporate-driven growth of technology and a culture of distraction. In the last dark streets of the city, people stand against this change to preserve their own ways of life. However, as entities start to sell it out, it becomes only a matter of time before the underground is divided and conquered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the midst of this, is Taylor. A simple person of an older time, struggling to keep their head above water as they\u2019re sucked deep into the heart of this conflict, and this division.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018Falling Dark\u2019 is a point and click adventure game with RPG elements, featuring:<br/>\u2022 Several branching narrative paths.<br/>\u2022 A blend of 'Point and Click' puzzle solving and combat.<br/>\u2022 A variety of hidden side-quests and encounters.<br/>\u2022 And an original soundtrack.</p>\n<p>Also, this game is not rated by the ESRB, but if it were, it would be a hard M.\u00a0</p><p>You've been warned.</p>\n<p>[CONTROLS]</p>\n<p>The game is played entirely with the mouse. Left click operates, uses, picks things up, and walks, while right click examines things.<br/>At the top of the screen in game, is an inventory menu, as well as a menu with saving, loading, an objective log, stats, a help menu, and options.\u00a0<br/>All dialogue can be passed with a mouse click or key press.<br/>You can examine items, and combine them.</p>\n<p>[GRAPHICS]</p>\n<p>Due to variations among computers there are a multitude of potential graphical errors.<br/>If when you launch the game it is very small in either windowed or fullscreen, or if the pixels seem blurred or poor quality, try launching the setup application (the other program with a blue cup icon). Here you can try changing the windowed to fullscreen, and the filtering.\u00a0<br/>The best filtering setting is generally 'Max nearest-neighbour filter' for all resolutions.</p>\n<p>[IN CONCLUSION]</p>\n<p>If you have something to say about the game, or just otherwise want to get in contact, you can reach me at \u2018thelibraryupstairs@gmail.com\u2019.</p>\n<p>And if you enjoyed either\u00a0of the fantastic musicians featured in the game, you can seek more of their work here:</p>\n<p>Gavin Miller -\u00a0https://balthazarandtheboys.bandcamp.com/</p>\n<p>\u00a0Satvrne -\u00a0https://satvrne.bandcamp.com/</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br/>Fransis\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:52:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e66/e66ea1d7d2d06e9484445c27d8c43421.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thinking of Cremation?"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
