The premise is simple: move a set of 3D blocks to fit inside a 2D shape. As you progress, however, you will encounter impossible geometries and maddening complexity that will force you to abandon your previous notions of shape, perspective, and space. Are you up to the challenge? <br/><br/>SIMPLICITY<br/>qubo\u2019s distinct art style was inspired by the minimalist artwork of James Turrell and Piet Mondrian. Expect smooth gradients, sharp outlines, and soothing color palettes as you work your way to find a solution to each puzzle.<br/><br/>COMPLEXITY<br/>Each of qubo\u2019s 72 puzzles brings a new idea to the table, revealing surprising complexity hidden within a seemingly simple mechanic.<br/><br/>AUTONOMY<br/>qubo respects your time and energy as a player. No tutorials, gimmicks, or hand-holding. Solve one puzzle, or solve them all. The choice is yours.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T04:47:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f8480875565c207d94b88d510164fec1.jpg", "website": "https://quboga.me/press", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Cronyx"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Cronyx"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
