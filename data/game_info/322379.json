Medieval high fantasy style. Towns grow as time goes by. Buildings are destroyed and constructed. And they have a direct impact on what can be bought in the market. Tired from the world that you played but want the same party? Go on, generate a brand new world to explore with your favorite band of misfits. Day night cicle included. And it changes with the seasons too! And a weather system with clouds and fog.CharactersYou can create a party that is composed by different characters. Everything is permited. Want a warrior that plow through enemies with powerful attacks? Check. Want a more cunning and evasive one? You got it. Mages that can harness a destructive power? Or maybe a more defensive and healing oriented one? Maybe a support druid kind? You got it covered! Even a mix between all of this is possible (and can even be VERY powerful). There are still five races to pick. Oh, and appearence is customizeable for each character too!The RulesThe rules are simple and are based on:<br/><ul><li>Small numbers (3 Attributes ranging from 0 to 5, Health 10 to 20 and so on)<br/></li><li>Rock-Paper-Scissors mind set (a tool, skill and strategy for each case)<br/></li><li>Less is more mentality (texts and descriptions are reduced to be in a line or less)</li></ul>Animated Combat", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e13f5239d9a0181c676322c5420659f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kezarus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kezarus"], "esrb_rating": null}
