The One True Lands has lately fallen victim to chaos, ever since the one known as the Jellymancer took residence in the eastern lands.</p>\n<p>To some, it may seem like we just make pizza. But our crew know that the reality is: we are battling the chaos brought from the Jellymancer, one delicious pizza at a time.</p>\n<p>We have just received a\u00a0<strong>very interesting</strong>\u00a0order\u2026</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Travel throughout the One True Lands in order to fulfil the order made by the Jellymancer.</p>\n<p>In order to create the most impressive pizza, attempt to collect as much ingredients on your journey. The Jellymancer will judge your pizza based on its toppings and your preparation skills.</p>\n<p>Visiting islands along the way will allow you to gain ingredients for your pizza and maps for saving time. You'll also meet a variety of islanders and be faced with decisions to make as a crew. Be wary, a crew needs good morale to continue sailing the seas - as the journey is long and lonely.</p>\n<ul><li>Click on islands in order to visit the islands.</li><li>Select the choice that suits your crew when presented with choices.</li><li>Two mini games can be found that abstract the process of combat, finding ingredients and preparing the pizza.</li></ul><p>1. Matching game:\u00a0Click on tiles\u00a0to reveal what's underneath. Find pairs in order to gain the tiles rewards.</p><p>2. Timing game: Use the\u00a0C key\u00a0to drop the ingredients into place on the pizza.</p>\n\n<p>You can\u00a0scroll with the mouse\u00a0to zoom in and out on map screen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:04:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b6/3b64523522c0f5238987e969b63450a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HonestDan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
