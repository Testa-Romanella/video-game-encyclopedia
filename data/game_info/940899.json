(I am also a link click me!)</p>\n\n<p>Hi there!\u00a0I made this little fan game as a gift for Shxtou! He was the first Vtuber I super got into and was one of the reasons why I started to stream. My life has only really gone up since\u00a0I entered the Vtubing community and I felt like making a little game like this was super necessary to give back the person who inspired me.<br/><br/>This arcade game is based on a real life one called Wonder Wheel. I wanted to adapt those elements of shooting a coin into throwing a knife at monsters to match Shxtou as a guild leader a lot more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of the development of this game was streamed so if you want to watch it it'll be here and also here is a time-lapse as well [ will also do it later]</p>\n<p>VODs in Order</p>\n<ol><li>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1741580582</li><li>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1749390727</li><li>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1750326731</li><li>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1750400404</li><li>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1757963971</li><li>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1758857028</li><li>https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1761811017</li></ol>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made with Quibli Shaders\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T12:48:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8f/e8fd77ab19dab04e994e742777ebb715.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Niko the Neko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
