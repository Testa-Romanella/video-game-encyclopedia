I HAVE HAD REPORTS FROM PEOPLE WHO WHINED THAT MY GAMES DON'T WORK PROPERLY AND I THINK HTML5 + ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN FIREFOX IS TO BLAME FOR THIS. </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Stalker 2D is a remake of my game called Stalker. Instead of being a RPG with a top-down perspective, it is a platformer and a sidescroller. It was created in GDevelop for the Remake Game Jam.<br/></p>\n<p>Much like the original game, this game includes:</p>\n<ol><li>Stealth and stealth-like elements.</li><li>A very primitive inventory management.</li><li>Horror elements like an unsettling atmosphere and chases.</li></ol>\n<p>Note that unlike the original, it took me less than 1.5 weeks to make while the original was made in a few months, so not all the content is there yet and that's assuming I even want to work on this past the jam.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>I programmed the game with the intention to allow the player to rebind controls, but for now this is what you get:</p>\n<p>Movements = Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Return to main menu (From tutorial) = Escape key</p>\n<p>Sprint = Left Shift</p>\n<p>Jump = Space key<br/></p>\n<p>Interact = Left Control</p>\n<p>Shuffle selected item = Tab key<br/></p>\n<p>Use item = \"P\" key</p>\r\nAttributions\r\n\n<p><strong>Royalty free or public domain assets are not included!</strong><br/>\u00a0</p>\r\nDevelopment \r\n<p>\u00a0CyberRobotnix \u00a0</p>\r\nGraphics \r\n<p>\u00a0CyberRobotnix <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Celianna <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Starbird <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Tuomo Untinen <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Lanea Zimmerman <br/></p>\n<p>Daniel Armstrong <br/></p>\r\nAudio \r\n<p>\u00a0JessKawaiiXxX <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0HaelDB <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0yewbic <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Sigmarune <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0hectavex <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Brandon Morris <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Bart Kelsey</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T11:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfeb735a93cb0c6b14f4827b24dfa113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CyberRobotnix"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
