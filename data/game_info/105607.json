They will fall in love, or in hate, based on your behaviour and that of others, and will act accordingly. The story that ensues might be sweet and romantic, or it might be melodramatic or even bloodthirsty.</p>\n<p>You can do whatever you want at this party! Perhaps you shall find a fitting husband or wife and woo them. Perhaps you will just really, really, really piss everyone off. You're the protagonist in a video game, and you should definitely take advantage of that to just do some really dumb stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is short, but designed to be replayed lots of times.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6d/e6d537560aa4452f057174726e88a7bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["puddletron"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
