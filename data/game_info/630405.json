Currently there are two \"story\" levels (the first leads into the second) and a debug level to play around in.</p>\n<p>The idea I have for this is that it could evolve into a semi-open-world style game with some RPG elements and come to resemble a mixture between Deus Ex, Synthetik, and the Genesis Shadowrun game, which have all been fairly major influences for me.</p>\n<p>You'll notice semi-authentic gunplay with firearms that require unloading.</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave feedback/advice.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD for movement.</p>\n<p>Shift to boost, if wearing armor that supports it.</p>\n<p>LMB to fire.</p>\n<p>MMB or E to eject a magazine.</p>\n<p>R to reload current weapon with a magazine.\u00a0 This will also eject if EZ Gun is on.</p>\n<p>ESC to return to main menu.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>\n<p>There is no music, despite the game supporting it.</p>\n<p>The AI would be infinitely better with a finite state machine hooked up. That's high priority.<br/></p><p>Shotguns do not have unique ammo icons like rifles and handguns.
