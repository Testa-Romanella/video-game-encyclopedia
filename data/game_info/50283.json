Space Corporation Sigma decided to extract these crystals. The extraction was carried out by NKX-627 Robot series. However, soon the Corporation Sigma discovered that they were not the only ones who were interested in the crystals. The invasion of the little-known species of biometal beetles on the planet Niburium was sudden. Numerous hordes of beetles occupied the bowels of the planet Niberium.

Corporation Sigma, as an interested party, using the currently available technologies, released a new search NKXgr-701 Robot series. This robot could change the gravity of certain types of matter by breaking the usual physical laws. It was decided to adjust the antigravitator to change the gravity of the stone masses, under the rubble of which the crystals were lying. Also, beetles could be blocked with stones in an enclosed space. The Corporation Sigma goal is to collect all the crystals and take them out...<br/>\r\nThere are 20 levels in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/532ff4e749c0a9a8a4ad15b97ea63e1a.jpg", "website": "https://vk.com/atriagames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MetamorphoGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atriagames"], "esrb_rating": null}
