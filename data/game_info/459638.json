Taking part in our first ever game jam has been a frantic but fun process but we're really excited to share our game.</p>\n\n<p>Two-Can-Do is a simple co-op platformer with a twist. For each level the\u00a0movement capabilities of each player are limited and different. Therefore\u00a0the two jelly-like brothers, '1' and '2', must work together to each their goal through\u00a0completing a\u00a0series of movement based puzzles.</p>\n<p>For example, '1' may be able to move but not jump and '2' may only be able to jump.\u00a0</p>\n<p>'Movement Blocks' are scattered throughout the levels. Collect these to open up new\u00a0movement capabilities and help the brothers reach their goal.</p>\n\n<p>Two-Can-Do links to the theme 'Two' by being a game where you control two characters (either solo or in co-op),\u00a0 and complete puzzles using two different movement types between each player (move and jump).<br/></p>\n<p>With only 10 of the 48 hours available we were only able to create ... levels for the game. Despite lacking a wide range of levels we hope you enjoy the game, the idea behind the puzzles and\u00a0it's fun squishy characters :D</p>\n<p>AF'BROS GAMES\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Note: Despite our name this is a solo submission)</p>\n\n<p>CREDIT:</p>\n<p>Used music by jobromedia:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/happy-walk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/991/99122e403a90f7222ae353c6d0215796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AF'BROS GAMES"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
