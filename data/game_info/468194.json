The two of you must move fast in order to survive!<br/><br/>This is a linear Twine story with some visual elements. About 3-5 minutes long.\u00a0 I was hoping to include more visuals and add a little more polish, but time constraints in a game jam always hold you back.</p>\n<p>In any case, I'm very happy with the result of my work this weekend. I hope you enjoy.
