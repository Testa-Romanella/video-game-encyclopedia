This game was made for my university final project and the amount of gamplay was made with an exhibition in mind, hence why it is short. It may be expanded upon in the future, but for now it will stay this length.\u00a0 ^^<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e6e67ec6f7a11d48526f3a644a47446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["thetictactician"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
