It features physics, HDRP, powerups, high scores, music, and much other fanciness.</p>\n<p>Two months ago I was so tired about coding in javascript all the time in my job that I decided I wanted to start learning Unity to have some coding activity to relieve myself from that fatigue. I spent this time doing courses in\u00a0Unity learning. Last week I finished the last one and decided I wanted to put all i learned into small games rather than keep doing courses. So, this the very first one. Probably it doesn't worth your download, but I was looking forward to uploading my first game to itch.io :D</p>\n<p>Credits to Bensound for the awesome music, available for free in his webpage.</p>\n<p>W10 executable</p>\n<p>Project available in github</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T04:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adc/adc3c54f4bedb2f47926215fbd7ff349.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fran Bosquet"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
