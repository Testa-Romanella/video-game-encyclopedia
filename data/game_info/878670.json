{"id": 878670, "slug": "whim-beta", "name": "WHIM! Beta", "name_original": "WHIM! Beta", "description": "<p>WHIM! is a VR game for Meta Quest 2. It is a visual and spatial skills game where you sequentially hit, under time pressure, a series of randomly-spawned objects. It challenges your perception of 3-D objects while making quick connections in the head to figure out patterns, connect missing parts, or identify pieces that will complete an analogy.</p>\n<p>WHIM! is inspired by visual and spatial skills tests on lateral thinking, spatial aptitude, and logical reasoning; however, it is not equivalent to or a replacement for professional standard or practice tests. It is primarily a visual and mental challenge, with a little exercise for the arms and hands.</p>\n<p>This version is the development stage version of the game and represent only a fraction of the full game. Bugs and other issues may be encountered. The developer welcomes any comment or suggestion to improve this game.</p><p>This game is playable on Meta Quest 2 (Oculus Quest 2). It is played  without controllers so you should enable Hand Tracking in the Quest 2  Settings.\r\n  </p>\n<p>There's no need to sideload this game if you have SideQuest installed in your headset (install SideQuest). Just go to SideQuest and download this game from there and it will direct you back to this page.\r\nEnjoy the game! Thanks for downloading it!</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T10:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f927ba10613349c7460872056297ede9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ymmersive"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
