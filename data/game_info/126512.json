It utilizes the Oculus Rift virtual reality head set and Razor Hydra motion controller to create an immersive environment to simulate catching objects thrown at you.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCatch creates a fun environment for a person to practice repetitive motions in a fun way, and as the player gets better, the game becomes faster paced to increase the motion range of the player.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game is set in a park, to counter the stereotypical concept of \"rehab in hospital\". It encourages the feeling of freedom, and the background music lightens the mood.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThere is no failure in the game, as it only keeps track of items caught and thrown, so that the player can track their personal progress over time. As lacking mobility is already an incredibly stressful scenario, we didn't want to bring that feeling into this game, and thus, there is no end to the 'level'.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game has been designed for the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality headset. This virtual reality headset occludes the real world, which means that people can forget about their hospital environment for a while. It allows them to move through virtual 3D space with real head movements, which allows them to become immersed into the virtual world for the time that they play.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe theme is similar to Hunter Hoffman's \r\n\tVirtual Reality Pain Reduction project, in putting a patient into a virtual world to change the person's perspective and awareness of themselves and their environments.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Credits<p>\r\n\t\tDevelopment Team\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Glenn Brink</li>\n<li>Connor Deckers</li>\n<li>Cassandra Boles</li>\n<li>Simon Stannus</li>\n<li>Alex Oakly</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tAttributions<br/>\n</p><ol>\n<li>Monkeys Spinning Monkeys<br/>\r\n\tKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\n<em>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>\n</em><em>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</em>\n</li>\n<li>Game Assets sourced from Unity Asset Store and TurboSquid.com<br/>\n</li>\n</ol><p>\n<strong>Known Bugs</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Menu is non-functional at the moment, use space bar to launch game from menu.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1e/c1ec373739af0f81da69b53c85044284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["almostperfect"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
