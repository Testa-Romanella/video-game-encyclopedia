Allow your senses to guide you as you explore the mysterious scenes that comprise the world of Dwell. As the title suggests, you are challenged not only to explore these spaces, but to dwell within them, to let your mind carry you. Your past memories weave together with beautiful descriptions of nature to create this story. As you walk, feel, smell, watch, and hear this world, look for what lies beneath.</p>\n<p>\"I welcome you to take the first step and explore, and you will find a world intimately familiar and strangely unknown. Take as much or as little time as you want. There are no beginnings or endings. You are both here and not here. This is the inneffable. This is to Dwell.\"</p><p>-Matthew</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T06:38:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8a/f8a656bbec7f4b2dac4032cdfae1d984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["virtualchild"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
