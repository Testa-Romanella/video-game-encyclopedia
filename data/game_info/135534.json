So I decided to give it some more work and release for everyone to enjoy :)</p><p><strong>The Jam</strong><br/></p><p>\r\n\tThe jam theme was 'Spring Into The Future' hence the main character is a spring. If you are interested in looking at other submissions they can be found \r\n\there, also check out the playthrough of every submission done by AwesomeAllar on \r\n\this Twitch channel. He is a great guy who does a lot of awesome stuff including but not limited to monthly playthroughs of every UE4Jam submission for that month. </p><p><strong>Genre</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game itself is a fast paced 3D platformer, a tribute of sorts to platformers of the past, except this time the camera is not trying to drive you mad (hopefully). </p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p><p>The gameplay is a spring character jumping through levels, overcoming obstacles and defeating enemies to collect enough of anti-rust substance that is required for him to stop himself from succumbing to rust in the future. There will be unlockable active abilities and character upgrades. Each level takes only a few seconds to a couple of minutes to beat.</p><p><strong>Download</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tFor now there is a demo version available that will be updated to reflect current state of the game. I intend to release full version later for a very low price. I will consider it ready when there are at least three full worlds with a dozen levels each, complete with bosses.</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89f/89fc9c8ebaa05c47467edbb085bae28c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["drgrimdark"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
