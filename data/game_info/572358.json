Your job is to assist with an investigation that will be conducted by SpaceCorp's proprietary Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) system after a major incident at one of SpaceCorp's remote security outposts. The A.I. will automatically process any communication from the person manning the outpost and generate possible responses. You will need to select the most appropriate response to reply with in order to uncover what actually happened during the incident.</p>\n<p>The inspiration for this story came after reading about Hiroo Onoda, a WWII Japanese soldier who was posted to a remote jungle outpost and told to defend it until he was relieved of his post. Onoda remained on duty defending his\u00a0jungle outpost for almost 30 years unaware that the war had ended decades earlier.</p>\n<p>So with this game I wanted to explore the idea of what motivates someone to\u00a0live alone in isolation, except instead of a remote jungle, a space outpost at the edge of the galaxy.</p>\r\nNotes\r\n<p>Since this practice prototype was made for my own learning purposes, I've limited the number of choices on each turn to a maximum of two to avoid too much branching. There is only one unique ending but multiple paths. If you reach the end of\u00a0\u00a0<em>the story</em>\u00a0 part 1, you will be able to restart and try to find alternative paths to the same ending. Apologies in advance for spelling errors and poor grammar (especially to my grade school English teacher).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, let me apologize for the length of these notes, which may have taken you longer to read than actually playing the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>P.S.</strong> I've experimented with some speech synthesis for the A.I. with mixed success -- let's just consider it a work in progress.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T05:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8faa4101e67a40bdbb4869903557f370.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itizso"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
