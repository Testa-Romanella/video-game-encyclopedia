Only through death can you grow strong enough and fast enough to win the encounter. When you die, you can gain\u00a0<strong>SPIRIT</strong> points to spend on four different stats. Use your\u00a0<strong>SPIRIT</strong>\u00a0wisely to build your character into a badass. But keep an eye on the\u00a0<strong>DOUBT</strong> meter! Every time you die, one\u00a0<strong>DOUBT</strong>\u00a0point is added to the character, making it weaker and weaker. If you die with four <strong>DOUBT</strong> points, the game is over. Good luck!</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Pendulum</em> started as a project for the #NewJamCity game jam, organized by the Waypoint community forum in July 2017. The concept came from its original title,\u00a0<em>A Lil' Murder Never Hurt Nobody</em>, which was selected and used for inspiration as part of #NewJamCity's rules.</p>\n<p><em>Pendulum</em>\u00a0is a short but complete prototype, currently with no concrete plans to develop it further.
