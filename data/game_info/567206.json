I would really appreciate it if you could give the game some feedback on the itch page, and report some bugs as well in the discord server. I will only develop this game on my freetime, as im still 13 and i need to attend school, developing would be so much easier if i have more funds, so if you have a dollar or two consider donating some funds, it would really help me alot :) For More Updates about the game, consider following my twitter.<br/></p>\n<p>Join my Discord\u00a0 for\u00a0\u00a0for Announcements, Bug report, Feedback, and Suggestions about the Game.</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter\u00a0for stuff :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:37:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2b/a2b90e9ddbfb4105a590b4f532e26f89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["H\u00b3Oof"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
