World Outside has a heavy reliance on combat and action gaming and combat customization.<br/><br/><strong>Nera</strong><br/>Our first protagonist and the more mysterious of the two, the witch Nera starts her first quest as a privilege of her new status as a full member of her organization. There are doubts about the wisdom of her choice however...<br/><br/><strong>Adelaine</strong><br/>A young boy Nera meets during her adventure. Naive and honest to a fault it's possible his personality traits aren't entirely human.<br/><br/><strong>What's unique about WO?</strong><br/>It's an action heavy RPG that uses the new CoRE Engine created to simulate accurate movement and control. It also features a custom animated menu system, particle-based graphics, advanced game options, and a combo-based system that lets you customize the dozens of skills to suit your play style easily!<br/><br/>World Outside was created (like too many of my projects...) for a contest and was the first 'testing ground' of a new combat system that I plan to use for at least one or two more games and was the prototype for a new VX combat system based on a brawling system.<br/><br/>There are a number of game options you can customize as well, from hiding numbers in combat to changing or disabling special battle music to difficulty ratings and lowering particle counts for lower-end machines.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T07:08:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbf484f4e7b44e93c0c89023617151f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaskedIntrovert"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
