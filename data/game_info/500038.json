I have plenty of content planned but this is a fairly good approximation of how I imagine the controls feeling. Please do comment with any suggestions on how to improve the control scheme or generally the feel of the protagonist, is the sword too slow is the movement slow down when wielding weapon/shield too agressive, that sort of thing. <br/>see https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset for tileset. Used as temporary art assets. <br/><br/>Controls are: <br/>WASD, <br/>left click draws your sword move your mouse to swing it,<br/>Right click draws your shield move your mouse to angle it,<br/>Esc quits the game.<br/><br/>There are some minor known bugs, occational pixel wide gaps between tiles, sometimes things are knocked hard enough they clip through the walls and the player animations sometimes messing up, I am working on these.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:21:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32a/32ac720a556f2d3cd67b7de769aa93aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Triforcesplash"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
