Assemble your\r\ngun to fit YOUR OWN playstyle, and give those androids a much needed\r\nhard reset. Join your friends via LAN multiplayer and go on quests\r\ntogether, or just fiddle around with gun setups all day!</p>\n<p>\r\nThis\r\nis the pre-alpha concept demo for BadLands RoadTrip, to accompany our\r\nKickstarter campaign. You can already play around with all of the\r\nmechanics, experience part of the story, and enjoy multiplayer\r\nLAN with an unlimited amount of other gamers. It is still missing a\r\ncouple of things, such as: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>The world will be 4 times as big</li><li>More quests</li><li>More gun parts</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you want to stream playing of this game, please do.
