You can modify the layout of the map, plan the paths of the incoming enemies, and research dozens of upgrades and towers.<h3>Be a real road architect</h3>You have complete control over the map. Carve the path of your enemies, set deadly traps like Ice, Water or Magma tiles. You won't only build towers, but construct the ways between them! Create endless mazes to slow down the incoming monsters. Be careful and think ahead. After every 7th wave, a new summoning portal will open to send even more enemies against you.<h3>Get to know your almighty invaders</h3>Can you defend your territory from all of them? Try your luck against King Zombeard, the army of necromancers, sneaky Trolls, splitting Golems or the powerful Demon King who brings nothing but destruction... Be the saviour of your fortress and stop the vicious horde. Fight like your life depends on it!<h3>Discover endless upgrades, limitless researches</h3>Unlock various towers from the large Talent Tree! Inferno Tower, Thunder Tower, zombie summoner Coffin, or Teleport Mage? The choice is yours, research different towers to maximize your efficiency, boost your economy or simply experiment with weird combos which can literally break the game - a great amount of teleport mages might be able to endlessly circulate the enemies ;)<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Endless Gameplay<br/></li><li>More than 25 types of monsters<br/></li><li>20 different Towers<br/></li><li>A huge talend tree with dozends of upgrades<br/></li><li>A unique tile creation system<br/></li><li>Unique strategies to experiment with</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T06:38:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/800/80010cd73d3d14828d2fc2868fa1bc24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Cs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Adam Cs"], "esrb_rating": null}
