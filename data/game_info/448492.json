You can choose from a wide variety of songs to play and you'll be able to try our amazing scenarios to play!<br/></p>\n<p>Dev Updates:</p>\n<p>11/05/2020 - 12:44</p>\n<p>Fixed the bug that happened when you selected the modifiers \"Faster Balls\" and \"Faster Song\" that made the balls not match the music.</p>\n<p>Fixed a bug that made a shooting sound play when you entered the tutorial.</p>\n<p>14/05/2020 - 00:06</p>\n<p>We added a new icon, we added some very special people to the credits:</p>\n<p>- Isidro Navarro: our mentor and biggest adviser.</p>\n<p>- David Sol\u00e0: a good friend and also a very good adviser.</p>\n<p>- \u00c0lex G\u00f3mez: creator of the 3D models for the pistols.</p>\n<p>- Maxim Dobroselsky: creator of the DryWetMidi library for C#.</p>\n<p>14/05/2020 - 11:15</p>\n<p>We added a \"skip tutorial\" button and we changed the color of the aim laser to make it more visible.\r\n</p>\n<p>21/05/2020 - 23:35</p>\n<p>We changed the way the notes work, now it's two circles that cross when the note plays. This makes it more intuitive to know when you have to shoot the note. We also made the balls bigger and we enlarged their hitbox.</p>\n<p>Second, we have changed the modifiers/difficulty settings. Now you can choose between simple and advanced mode. Being Simple a basic Easy-Normal-Hard system predefined and Advanced shows all the possible modifiers.\u00a0This will make playing easier and less intimidating for new players and will allow experienced players to keep choosing their personal favourite combination of modifiers.</p>\n<p>And last, but not least, we made a little change in the small ball that helps you know which note will play next. Now, when the next note is far from the last one, the ball will divide into 3 to help you keep track of it more easily.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T05:03:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbdeba49d886a61a1937683e83944df2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kyoko Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
