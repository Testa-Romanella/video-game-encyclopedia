This was a project I made in college while branching off of a Unity course I had taken online, and the idea was to see how far I could take the concepts that I had learned from the course material.</p>\n<p>The game has three levels to beat!\u00a0In each level you can gain points by:</p>\n<ul><li>Hitting the ball against colored blocks</li><li>Shooting enemies</li><li>Shooting the metal blocks near the top of the screen</li></ul>\n<p>To proceed to the next level, just knock out all the colored blocks with the ball! An empty health bar is equivalent to losing one life.</p>\n<p>Controls: Mouse to aim, use Space, LMB, or RMB to shoot!</p><p>Github Repo:\u00a0https://github.com/WillyBeeCoding/Block-Invaders</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T12:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b82/b8222ae0e0cdf593c57665ac3b009c90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Willy Bee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
