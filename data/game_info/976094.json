{"id": 976094, "slug": "dark-is-the-void", "name": "Dark is the Void", "name_original": "Dark is the Void", "description": "Dark is the Void is a JRPG-inspired roguelike that forgoes a story in place of pure combat, loot hoarding, min-maxing, and grinding out levels and trait points on your characters. It features 24 playable classes, each with dramatically different playstyles, special mechanics, and custom UI elements. These classes touch on the standard MMO roles of Tank, Healer, and DPS; but each class also has a high level of hybridity, blending different types of support seamlessly into each. Fast paced, real-time, menu-driven combat forms a backbone for intense tactical battles.<br/><br/><ul><li>24 Classes, each with unique play styles, mechanics, and UI's<br/></li><li>Fierce, tightly balanced, menu-driven battles<br/></li><li>Play in real time, or auto-pause as you issue commands<br/></li><li>MMO-style 'Threat' mechanics and Class roles<br/></li><li>Multiple difficulty settings to support everything from casual to the most hardcore enthusiasts<br/></li><li>Play with Keyboard, Mouse, Controller, or Touch-screen<br/></li><li>No story to slow things down; just pure gameplay<br/></li><li>Customize your character\u2019s appearance with the in game editor<br/></li><li>Explore a vibrant 16-bit Pixel-art world<br/></li><li>300+ Hand-made items</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T07:31:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/775/77558505905562eab7feb1b470230d08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tiekada Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tiekada Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
