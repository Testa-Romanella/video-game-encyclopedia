Once discovering her powers, The Earth\u2019s Council exiles the witch to the moon to live out the rest of her life looking at the earth - and the woman she loves - that she can never go back to. The player spends 5 minutes each day over the 28 days reflecting on her experiences on Earth, meditating at her altar, and making a life or death choice.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is a daily meditational activity composed of a memory game, drawing symbols, receiving a mantra, and making a decision about the future of the earth. The game tracks the decisions the player makes, becoming a sort of mood tracker. Depending on their feelings over the lunar cycle, the player will experience one of the six unique endings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRitual of the Moon is fully created from handcrafted and found objects scanned then digitally manipulated. Each of the witch\u2019s reflections were hand-embroidered. The mantras were wood burned. The artists used paint, clay, fabric, paper, dried plants, wool, foam, wire, plastic, pieces of computer hardware, crystals, and a variety other media. The process was long, meditative, and iterative.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRitual of the Moon was written and designed by Kara Stone, with art and sound by Rekha Ramachandran and Julia Gingrich, programmed by Chris Kerich, Matthew R.F. Balousek, Kevin Stone and Hope Erin Phillips, and music composition by Halina Heron and Maggie McLean.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/681afaa38cd6a920f60017d7aa0372ca.jpg", "website": "http://ritualofthemoongame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kara Stone"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kara Stone"], "esrb_rating": null}
