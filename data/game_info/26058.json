Art Academy: First Semester will guide you \n      through the basics of using pencil and paints, which draw like the real \n      things. With your own paintbrush set and color palette, you will learn \n      texturing and blending techniques, along with how to depict light and \n      shade. There is also Free Paint mode where you can select photos from \n      your Nintendo DSi Camera Album to draw from. In just a few lessons, you \n      will be discovering your inner artist and creating your own \n      masterpieces, with art skills that you can apply with real-life \n      materials.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ed/5eddddf7ad7b0561c5d6ad214e0a0880.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
