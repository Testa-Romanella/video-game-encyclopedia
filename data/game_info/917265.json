There are three types of aliens: the green squid, the blue bubble, and the red fox. You shoot by aiming with the mouse and pressing the left mouse button. Jumping can be achieved by shooting downwards and using the recoil effect of the gun. There are presently only 30 aliens to shoot down which should be enough for most players.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a pretty hard game. I didn't intend it to be be this hard.
