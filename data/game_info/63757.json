Not really, there are 3 locations: a City, a Desert, and Space.<br/>But this isn't all, whilst he's flying he only wears underpants for a... better experience... and better ventilation!<br/><br/>All the gameplay is accompanied with music by the \u00abHardbass School\u00bb<br/>They are a quite famous hardbass band, their tracks include: Nash Gimn, Narkotik Kal, Raz Raz Raz eto hardbass.<br/><br/>The idea about this game is quite simple: Mr.Vegan visits his psychologist, and she advises him to take vitamin B12 pills, but warns him NOT to use them before bedtime.<br/>Since he has a bad memory, he takes an overdose of the pills right before bedtime.<br/>Everything that follows is a dream.<br/>I came to the conclusion that the game doesn't need a background, or explanations, since the plot does not affect the gameplay in any way, it makes no sense to input a story.Features:<ul><li>10 tricky levels!<br/></li><li>26 easy Achievements!<br/></li><li>3 unique designed bosses!<br/></li><li>7 unique tracks by Hard bass School!</li></ul>Credits: <ul><li>Music by: Hard bass School<br/></li><li>Code and Art: CharlieH</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0d/a0ddc6e711645617ccc067dc8170c44e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sulton"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sulton"], "esrb_rating": null}
