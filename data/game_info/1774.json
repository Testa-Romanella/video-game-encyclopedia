{"id": 1774, "slug": "grim-fandango-remastered", "name": "Grim Fandango Remastered", "name_original": "Grim Fandango Remastered", "description": "<p>Grim Fandango Remastered is a rebuilt version of the original 1998 adventure game Grim Fandango. The game is set in the Land of the Dead, which is a unique in-between world on the souls\u2019 way from the mortal world to the spiritual one. All the in-game characters appear in calaca-like style, so the whole atmosphere reminds of the Aztec belief of the afterlife. Players assume the role of a Grim Reaper Manuel \u201cManny\u201d Calavera, who escorts souls on their travel through the Land of Dead. The story progress depends on the completion of quests and solving various puzzles. Players, in control of Manny, are able to interact with the environment in different ways including dialogues with other characters in order to get some hints and tips about current puzzles. According to game mechanics, players can never fail a mission or the whole game. The Remastered version includes numerous graphical improvements including repainted, hi-res character textures and new, dynamic lighting, which are expected to improve player experience.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2015-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:03:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/df2/df20fd77db56ae7b0a26a7ff4baa9ccc.jpg", "website": "http://grimremastered.com", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 560, "owned": 4465, "beaten": 535, "toplay": 260, "dropped": 303, "playing": 76}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 71, "ratings_count": 896, "suggestions_count": 558, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 901, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "iOS", "Linux", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Double Fine Productions", "LucasArts Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Double Fine Productions"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
