Hit the green zone to score a touchdown! Hit the red, and you just kinda hold the ball, not liking what you're seeing on the field. Hit any arrow key or the X or Z keys to stop the slider and do it again to start the slider back up. When the clock hits 0, the game is over.</p>\n<p>This game was written in 559 characters of code for TweetTweetJam 7, where the goal is to create a game in code that fits in two tweets worth of characters.
