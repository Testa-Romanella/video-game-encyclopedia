This fake NES-esque game was originally a present for user Zombiemode in the Pixonomicon Discord community's 2022 Secret Santa event.</p>\n\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p><strong>Enter</strong> launches Ronnie and lets you skip through the intro faster</p>\n<p><strong>Left &amp; Right</strong> move the platter</p>\n<p><strong>Down</strong> calls Ronnie back towards the platter. This has a cooldown, you can only use it when the bell icon is visible at the top</p>\n<p>The goal is to clear out all the toppings from the board. They'll gradually make their way down from the top, and if they reach the bottom it's game over! You get a bonus life every 500 points, and every time you clear the levels the game will loop with a score multiplier and faster speed. Good luck!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All code and assets were made by Hugues Ross, except the intro music.</p>\n<p>Intro music is \"Behind the column\" by Snabisch, downloaded from here and used under the Creative Commons BY 3.0 license<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T07:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/0945cb0120f1700c4603cc6e8e2a454a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Hugues Ross"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
