Like the first volume, Airport Madness 3D gives players a 3-dimensional air traffic control experience, from a control tower perspective. While Volume 1 offers easier airports, Volume 2 is guaranteed to challenge you. Push traffic as quickly as you can, while avoiding midair collisions. Choose good weather or bad, adjust the tower height to your preference, then do your best to manage jet traffic into and out of eight different real-world airports. Listen to human pilot voices as the aircraft obey your every command. Scan your radar screens for potential conflicts between aircraft.
