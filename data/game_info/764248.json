Wasn't my first game but it was probably my most complex back when actively developed in 2007, full of secret areas and unique skills you wont find in another platformer. This small game (7mb) is short and sweet probably takes 10 minutes per play through, but tons of replay-ability for speed runs and completionists. Can you find all 7 Magic Chalices? Give it a shot!</p>\n<p>\r\nArrow keys = Move <br/></p>\n<p>UP + Left = Jump Left <br/></p>\n<p>UP + Right = Jump Right <br/></p>\n<p>Down = Crouch &amp; Shield(if unlocked) &amp; Down Ladder <br/></p>\n<p>Up = Up Ladder <br/></p>\n<p>Shift = Hold + Move to run <br/></p>\n<p>1 = Fire Cannonballs <br/></p>\n<p>2 = Spawn Anvil <br/></p>\n<p>4 = Transform ???? <br/></p>\n<p>5 = Transform ???? <br/></p>\n<p>6 = Revert to Normal</p>\n<p>Collect Blue Crystals to use magic.
