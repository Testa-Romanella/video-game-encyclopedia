{"id": 672185, "slug": "falling-into-place", "name": "Falling Into Place", "name_original": "Falling Into Place", "description": "<p>Falling Into Place is a creative multiplayer party game where 3 to 6 players compete to write the funniest answers to absurd prompts-- the catch? You don\u2019t always get to choose the words you use! Each round begins with an initial question, which players can answer freely. This is your time to be clever in your word choice! Because once all players have responded, the words get scrambled through one of several plinko boards, and the real competition begins-- another prompt is generated, and players have to use only the words that fell into their bucket to create the funniest response!</p>\n<p>For the best experience, play with friends! This is a game about creativity and comedy, so go wild with it!\r\n</p>\n<p>And of course, please share any feedback you have about the game! We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This game was a collaboration as part of a Fall 2021 game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:02:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/991/9916a941eb0c35113629e84a39efdbaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zipper4242"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
