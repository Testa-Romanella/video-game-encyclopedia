That's how Super Bass Racing was born. The objective is to win the race in a boat, but for the player to be able to paddle, he must have energy and to gain energy he needs to fish and eat the fish, but to fish the player stands still. We wanted to have time to do other mechanics, but you know how it is ... Game jam, right ?! It's a game for 2 players.</p>\n<p>feedbacks are welcome, I will leave the ldjam link here below:<br/></p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/super-bass-racing<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["isaaclopinho"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
