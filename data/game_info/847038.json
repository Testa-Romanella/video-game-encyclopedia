The professor told us to use OpenGL (Difficult? As f**k), but I implemented ir first using the Raylib library in order to write all the game logic before applying in OpenGL.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple and minimalist:</strong></p>\n<p>There's nothing here that shouldn't be: the game has only one menu with all information. The art is made using Raylib functions, but (I promise) will be updated as soon as possible to something more beautiful.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In order to place your X or O on the board you only need to click with the left mouse key. Simple and efficient. The turn is updated automatically, so the second player can play it as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I replay?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Of course! After a winning / tie you'll be able to press SPACE and reset the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T11:58:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9de5d6e3b788c2db56ef900a7a00877.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["naldoni"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
