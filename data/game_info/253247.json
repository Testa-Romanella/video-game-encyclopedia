It is an addictive noughts and crosses game enriched with an extra dimension that will draw you into long hours of play and fun for everyone in any age.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game, which can be as simple as it once was or very demanding and difficult. We have a board with the size of three rows for three columns as in a classic game with an additional dimension which gives us six 3x3 game boards. Here we play as we used to, on one board to set a circle or cross in one line alternating with the other player. Whoever succeeds, he wins.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSimple what not? But imagine that we enlarged the ankle and enlarged it, enlarged it several times up to the size of 7x7 with an additional dimension which gives us the size of 7x7x7. We already have almost 250 possibilities to put our circle and cross. That it would not be enought difficult we add possibility of simultaneous play for 8 players so you can play with friends, or with our robot Xobox. This is a challenge and such game can take hours.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a825dbfd06ff0b49893c4d9f69f4c98a.jpg", "website": "http://xoboxgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xobox Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Xobox Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
