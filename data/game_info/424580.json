The main character keeps getting distracted by numerous related and unrelated events, and it's your role to keep her on track... or at least handle the problems in the least complicated way.</p>\n<p>Current release is still a beta, feedback is welcome! If you find this from the DevTalk+ Discord, you can send me your feedback via DM. Otherwise, you can comment below, but please start you message with the current game version indicated both near the download button and in the About page from the title menu (e.g. \"v3.0\"). This will help me track feedback as I improve the game over time.</p>\r\nChangelog\r\nv3.1 - 2020-04-02\r\nAdded\r\n<ul><li>BG: bus outside, bus inside, bakery</li><li>BGM: ambient street, bakery, mobile game</li><li>SFX: smartphone notification</li><li>UI: Task Tree view (open with T key at any time or click on notepad icon)</li><li>Visual: show coins when MC pays in bakery and for the bus</li><li>Dialogue: tutorial for Task Tree view</li></ul>\r\nChanged\r\n<ul>\n<li>Improved sentences</li>\n<li>Improved transitions</li>\n<li>Fixed MC checking notifications during Printer scene</li>\n<li>Fixed screw showing instead of hex key and coins</li>\n<li>Fixed item name positions to make sure it fits in the box</li>\n<li>Change item box to gray for more harmonious colors</li>\n<li>Fixed time displayed on smartphone</li>\n<li>Fixed mobile game considered \"resumed\" when playing for the first game</li>\n</ul>\r\nv3.0 - 2020-03-31\r\n<p>Initial release and opening submission to NaNoRenO 2020<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T04:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/327/3270a97f6f6688f287f9be0cd4baeb57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Marionette", "komehara", "FirahFabe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
