You will in this game. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs levels progress, more types of aliens will appear and more of them!<br/>\r\nYou can award yourself a Blue Shield (timed) by hitting a blue umbrella which will protect you against blue alien bullets.<br/>\r\nBe warned though, it will not protect against any other color alien bullet or strike or collision!<br/>\r\nIf you shoot an aliens Umbrella, he'll fall toward you with more fire.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you get to level 9, then you're seriously skilled. Any more than that and you must be a machine!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy and have fun :)", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/972/9729d053e73e07c0dcf82393745faf1a.jpg", "website": "https://niftytools.co.uk/steam.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NiftyToolsUK"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["NiftyToolsUK"], "esrb_rating": null}
