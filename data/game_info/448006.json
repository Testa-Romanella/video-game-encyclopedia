At present, my plan for the game is as follows:</p><p>The game will be a puzzle-platformer where opposed to just plainly dying, a the character is turned into a zombie, before being respawned, meaning you have an extra enemy to get past.</p><p>While the zombies do pose a threat to the player, you can use the zombies to solve puzzles, as they do nothing but blindly follow the player.</p><p>With the advancement of levels, the puzzles will get more and more complex, and introduce many more interesting and fun mechanics!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:10:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff5c5901e2cfbc26b4c5857117332462.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael R Ryan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
