{"id": 215421, "slug": "tyrian-brawler", "name": "Tyrian Brawler", "name_original": "Tyrian Brawler", "description": "<p>This is my entry for the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2018.</p>\n<p>The theme is: \"GENRE, but you can\u2019t MECHANIC\"</p>\n<p>TyrianBrawler is a remake of the classic Tyrian 2000 scrolling shooter. To fit the theme, the player ship can't shoot. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrows</strong> - move ship</li><li><strong>X</strong> - Activate shield, reflecting any projectiles.</li><li><strong>C </strong>- Activate Ram ability (when charge is enough)</li></ul>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><em>After the last battle, the ship's weapons have been destroyed and now  our heroes must find another way to deal with the countless enemies.<br/></em></p>\n<p>The player has the following options:</p>\n<ul><li>Use the ship's charge to reverse the polarity of the shields, causing them to reflect the enemy projectiles. This may be used to focus enemy projectiles back at them.</li><li>Fully charge the ship shields in order to activate the Ram ability, which focuses all power to the front shield, becoming indestructible. At that moment, the engines are boosted to charge forward destroying any threat.</li><li>The enemies have homing missiles that will try to find the player. If shield energy is depleted and the player is smart, it can try to fool the missiles to hit the enemies.</li></ul>\n<p>I really hope you enjoy this little experiment. Keep in mind that it has a long way to go, before it is fully functionally and fun to play.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\n<p>Used Assets:</p>\n<ul><li>\"Remastered Tyrian Graphics\" art by Daniel Cook under CC-BY 3.0 license.</li><li>\"Iron Plague, a Sinistar clone\" by Daniel Cook under the \"I own all the copyrights and figure, what the heck.\" license.</li><li>Music by Alexander Brandon</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b163b2bd1c60d41b3791d58373ebc3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NibbleByte"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
