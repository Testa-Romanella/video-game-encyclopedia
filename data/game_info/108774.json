Time travel is now possible. You have volunteered to travel back to the Cretaceous to collect as much dinosaur material as you can without becoming a fossil yourself.<br/></p>\n<p>While your solar-powered time machine recharges, collect whatever prehistoric artifacts you can find (anything gold colored). Once charged, walk into it to get back home. Fame and fortune await, if you can make it back alive.<br/></p>\n<p>Your only real weapons against the huge dinosaurs all around you\u00a0are your wits and a stun gun. Use it in an emergency to immobilize all creatures in a limited\u00a0radius for a short amount of time. But be smart about it\u00a0because it's\u00a0also solar powered and\u00a0needs to charge between uses.</p>\n<p>Dinosaurs:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Ankylosaurus</li><li>\u00a0Maiasaura</li><li>\u00a0Parasaurolophus</li><li>\u00a0Triceratops</li><li>\u00a0Wuerhosaurus</li><li>\u00a0Baryonyx</li><li>\u00a0Microraptor</li><li>\u00a0Spinosaurus</li><li> T-Rex</li></ul>\n<p>Collectibles (and their point values):</p>\n<ul><li> Teeth (10)</li><li> Bones (50)</li><li> Feathers (100)</li><li> Feces (250)</li><li> Mosquitoes (500)</li><li> Eggs (1000)</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Use the numpad or WASDQEZC\u00a0to move.\u00a0Diagonal movement is allowed.</li><li>Bump attacks are possible but discouraged (I mean, they're dinosaurs)</li><li>Use \"I\" to open your inventory where you can see what you've collected and the state of your stun gun.</li><li>Use \"space\" to go into look/target mode where you can use \"tab\" or the arrow keys to inspect the things around you.\u00a0 Use \"space\" again when over a creature to stun it.</li></ul>\n<p>Playthroughs:</p>\n\n<p>Note: Most of the sprites used in the game were made by me prior to the actual game jam so that I\u00a0could concentrate on gameplay and balancing during the seven days.
