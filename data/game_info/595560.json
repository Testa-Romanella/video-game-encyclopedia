The difference between them is that the fixed version is shorter, and it has a few bug fixed (e.g. player not being able to reload a shotgun or enemies walking through the walls).</p>\n\n<p>Music by: Kevin Macleod, Darren Curtis<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:28:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/607/607e6e5dda6b2bdc6ec684b03cbe3847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheJohnyFeeD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
