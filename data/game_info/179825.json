Initially, the plan had been to create a small prototype in just a few days, but development took a turn towards a bigger project with more potential. As it is, it is still in an early phase of development, quite obviously. Whether or not development will continue remains to be seen. However, it is being currently released as a completely free demo, and I hope it is enjoyed as such.</p><p>If any bugs are experienced, contact robertsforrest25@gmail.com or send a message on angrylobstergames.tumblr.com and it will be patched ASAP</p><p>Also, hit up our facebook at https://www.facebook.com/pages/Angry-Lobster-Games/758709574245844?fref=ts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db53766117cbc834bddf91a6018c7a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Angry Lobster Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
