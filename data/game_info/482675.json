The food sorting company that hired you pays well, but your boss very picky. Mess up enough times and you might get fired!</p>\n<p>This game was created for the first Miz Game Jam.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/>Food items will randomly spawn. Among these foods are apples &amp; pears, which you must drag into their respective sections. Be careful however, as dragging the wrong food item into a section will make your boss mad. Waiting too long and allowing apples &amp; pears to de-spawn will also make your boss mad.</p>\n<p>Made in Unity.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:06:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/551/5515204f066f4544b14f93d20cf2a9f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["VisGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
