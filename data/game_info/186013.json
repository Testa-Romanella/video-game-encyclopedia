Each player starts<br/>with a rifle and they can pick up a weapon crate that randomly spawns and can<br/>give them a new weapon such as a flame thrower or a shotgun which they can use a<br/>few seconds. After all players are eliminated or the monster dies, the round<br/>will end. Depending on how well each player or monster does, they will receive<br/>points that they can use to upgrade their stats for increased damage, health,<br/>or speed. In addition, after the round is over the chance wheel will spin which<br/>modifies the game play for the next round. Game play can be changed in ways like<br/>having smaller players, a smaller monster, or even increased crate spawn rate.<br/>When the next round starts one of the soldiers is randomly selected to be the<br/>next monster and the cycle starts all over again.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>3 players battle the monster with an arsenal of weapons!</p>\n<p>Chance wheel means no two rounds will be the same!</p>\n<p>Grab weapons from air drops to defeat the FERAL BEAST!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93a/93adddcef9cd993a2cdaa3abf4563050.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["qu_monstergame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
