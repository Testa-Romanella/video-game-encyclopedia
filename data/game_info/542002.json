In this stealth platformer, the honour of doing so has been bestowed upon you \u2013 a member of the evasive Esoteric Order of Dagon. You have snuck on board Emma, a schooner set sail from New Zealand whose course runs directly over the rumoured location of the ancient underwater city of R\u2019lyeh, unbeknownst to its crew.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Many years ago, you bore witness to the dark and incomprehensibly terrible vision of Cthulhu itself. Whilst granting you enlightenment very few have ever come to know, the vision left you completely blind. However, in your possession is an ancient and mysterious stone tablet which grants you the power to navigate through your eternal darkness using the telepathic vision of Dagon\u2019s Eye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tablet is also thought to be the key to completing the Ritual of Awakening, and now it is up to you to descend into R\u2019lyeh to perform it. The goal is to make it to Emma\u2019s upper deck, locate its diving bell, and use it to enter R\u2019lyeh. Navigate past the ship\u2019s crewmembers using Hydra\u2019s Madness \u2013 another of the tablet\u2019s powers which briefly incapacitates its target with a bout of confusion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fulfill your duty to The Order: awaken Cthulhu, and bring about the Great Era.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>All audio and visuals were custom-made from scratch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T05:30:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f25/f25c5c0c325e46f4b92f7751df80e48c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ideation Dev", "AlexanderVerbaan", "ValkyrieZA", "liampulles", "smoo131"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
