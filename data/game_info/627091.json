To progress you must control your two dimensional\u00a0\u00a0character, however, to assist them you must move objects in the third dimension!</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>When you are in 3D mode you can pickup objects with 'E' and move them around the room on a grid via mouse and scroll wheel. When you move these objects to your preferred\u00a0position, by pressing 'E' again, they will rest in their final position. Once the objects are placed they will solidify and project silhouettes which your 2D player can navigate on. By pressing 'space' you can enter 2D mode and control the 2D player, press it again to adjust the objects in 3D. Be careful though, the 2D player will fall through the\u00a0silhouettes while you are in 3D!\u00a0Good luck finding the\u00a0squares!</p>\n<p>Controls for 3D:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>W, A, S, D:</strong> movement</li><li><strong>Mouse:</strong>\u00a0look</li><li><strong>E:</strong> pickup object / enter object mode<ul><li><strong>Scroll up:</strong> move object backwards</li><li><strong>Scroll down:</strong> move object forwards</li><li><strong>Mouse X, Y:</strong>\u00a0object position</li><li><strong>E:</strong> exit object mode</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Controls for 2D:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>A, D:</strong>\u00a0movement<br/>\n</li><li><strong>W:</strong>\u00a0jump</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> rotate view left</li><li><strong>E:</strong> rotate view right</li></ul>\n<p>Controls for both:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Spacebar:</strong> switch perspectives (wall player is looking towards)</li><li><strong>Escape:</strong> enter pause menu</li></ul>\n<p>Tips:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>When the 2D character reaches the edge of\u00a0current view it will move to the next view, provided no obstructions.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:09:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14f/14fdd2c967863028d1782657c0496abc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["zeincone studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
