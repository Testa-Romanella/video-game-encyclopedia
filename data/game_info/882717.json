Try to survive as the newly minted Metaboys come to destroy the OG gang! Can't stop won't stop running to the right!<br/><br/>Survive as long as you can, and pickup some coins while you're at it!\u00a0I heard from an elder Metaboy that if you reach the end there's a jar of Mayo waiting for you!<br/><br/><br/>The idea behind this game was to create a game where everything is moving to the right. Having enemies and projectiles coming from behind the player (opposite to the way that they are running) is not a concept that is often explored.<br/><br/>This game was written entirely in Java over the course of a weekend using my own Java 2D\u00a0game engine.<br/>Github repo:\u00a0https://github.com/abhasin3/metarun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T19:44:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c53e90f11fb026d8f8d5e22ac5434f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LudumAnthony"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
