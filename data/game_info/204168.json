There are many more features added and improved. Few of them are:</p>\n<ol><li>There are now altogether four levels.</li><li>All Levels are brand new.</li><li>Each level presents different challenges and it gets harder every time</li><li>Boss is introduced in the 4th level</li><li>Stomp attack function is added</li><li>Sound effects and new background audio is added</li><li>Static moving backgrounds are added which is different on different level</li><li>New Health and Switch UI</li><li>And few bug fixes</li></ol>\n<p>The main objective of the player in game is to collect the number of switches specified in every level. All the switches must be collected/flipped in order to open the exit door and proceed to the next level. At the fourth level, instead of switches, main boss needs to be defeated in order to open the exit door. Boss can be defeated by stomping on the head 4 times. Watch out for the spikes, their rate increases every time you stomp on the boss. Hint to defeat boss - Left and Right platforms spawns in every 5 seconds. Make use of them.</p>\n<p>Use arrows key to move and space to jump. That's all about the controls. Avoid spikes and ditches.<br/></p>\n<p>All the graphics are made by me. The spike.png is taken from google images. Audio pieces are downloaded from various royalty free audio websites. Thanks to various Youtube tutorials. Bits and pieces helped me create what I had in mind.<br/><br/>Overall, it was challenging and the class was fun. I learned a lot about Unity Engine and got to know more about C#.</p>\n<p>The game download link can be found at the bottom of this page.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72a/72a257284c8964af3add7de7c1c71f8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["nischal"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
