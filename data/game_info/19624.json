The main character gets caught in the middle of the war for power of the two bandit groups in which it is revealed that the playable character is a reincarnation of an old powerful being who is to save the world as described in an ancient prophecy.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Soulbringer is set in a three-dimensional world with a helicopter-like perspective offered to the players. The game features a sophisticated combat system, in which every weapon present in the game has a specific set of moves, which can later be expanded as the player levels up. A magic system is also present in the game. All the game&#39;s elements can counter each other and some time must be spent planning the most suitable usage strategy.</p>\n<p>The gameplay takes place in a fantasy kingdom of Ratenna, and its outskirts, such as the country of the elves. It is possible to visit different parts of the in-game world, such as the towns, dungeons and the so-called Well of Souls.</p>\n<p>The game is not linear with all the game&#39;s quests offering a set of tasks which can be completed in whichever order the player sees fit. There are also multiple ways of completing such tasks.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2000-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T08:27:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3cc314ed782d6abe502f91cce0487ad.jpg", "website": "http://kiss-ltd.co.uk/", "rating": 2.57, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 51, "owned": 998, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 12, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 37, "suggestions_count": 523, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 37, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Infogrames Europe", "Infogames Europe"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Kiss", "Funbox Media", "Blue Moon Red Owl"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
