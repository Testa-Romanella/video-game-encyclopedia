{"id": 3489, "slug": "the-crew", "name": "The Crew", "name_original": "The Crew", "description": "<p>The Crew is an online driving simulator developed by Ivory Tower.</p>\n<p>Alex Taylor, the brother of a 5-10 motor club founder Dayton, helps his brother run some errands. But it does not go according to plan as Dayton gets killed. Alex is framed for his murder and sent to prison. Five years pass, an FBI agent proposes a deal to Alex. He will be let go if he helps expose a corrupt FBI Special Agent. Alex agrees and sets out to seek revenge.</p>\n<p>The Crew features a vast open world that resembles the scaled down version of the modern United States. The map is divided into five regions each of which features different geography and weather. The game&#39;s missions can be played alone or in a player&#39;s crew. The game is online-only nonetheless. Apart from the usual races, players can participate in so-called skill challenges. After every mission, the player&#39;s score is saved and displayed to all his friends. Online matchmaking allows up to eight players to participate in one race.</p>", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2014-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T18:08:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b79/b797325a14fc62444ca6032d59aa1c75.jpg", "website": "http://thecrew-game.com", "rating": 3.3, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 96, "owned": 1828, "beaten": 212, "toplay": 41, "dropped": 291, "playing": 20}, "playtime": 15, "achievements_count": 233, "ratings_count": 462, "suggestions_count": 553, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 467, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Reflections", "Ivory Tower"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
