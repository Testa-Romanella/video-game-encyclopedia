Pressing w attaches the player into a root if they were falling or jumping, and in order to jump, the player has to stop pressing w (or else they will attach themselves immediately back into the root).</p>\n<p>Enemies move in vertical and horizontal directions and touching them will cause the player to lose control of the character.</p>\n<p>As the camera scroll gets faster, the player shoud start to climb by jumping, instead of climbing. Going through one side teleports the player to the other one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T22:50:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84d/84d265b7ee9dfe7bd3146a83263fa8b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jaugonza"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
