An evolution of PomPom's 2001 award winning game, Space Tripper. Travel the surface of large horizontally-scrolling platforms, and pit your highly maneuverable craft against hoards of enemies eager to blow you to bits, eat you or worse.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is simple. You are free to travel anywhere on the platform at anytime, but don\u2019t fall off! Powerful Blue Lasers and Red Spread Lasers come equipped, so use both weapons tactically to get through tricky situations. Power up your weapons with power crystals dropped by destroyed enemies. Oh, did we mention the blasting absolutely anything that moves?</p>\n<p>Enemies encountered are varied. Zippy UFOS. Fat Motherships. Tanks. Choppers. Slimy Slug creatures. Alien Insects. Aztec structures brimming with electricity. And of course, Big Bosses! 14 unique levels spread over 4 diverse worlds means there\u2019s always something new just around the corner.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKey features:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Furious retro shoot-em-up gameplay\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>14 completely unique levels spread over 4 worlds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Vibrant 3D visuals and effects\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Global Online Leaderboards\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Unlockable Challenge Games\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Achievements\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T00:54:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e43/e43ba95e19f1fa3043dd3925eb56e5c3.jpg", "website": "http://www.pompomgames.com/astrotripper.htm", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 285, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 457, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PC"], "developers": ["PomPom Games", "PomPom"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pom Pom Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
