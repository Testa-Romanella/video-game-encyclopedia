There are no in-app purchases, nor is there any limit on when and how often you can play.<br/><br/>Choose from 8x8, 10x10, 12x12, 15x15 or 20x20 puzzles generated to be challenging, but not frustrating. These puzzles are the perfect coffee break for your mind.<br/><br/>The simple game design in this app makes it easy to mark up the grid. You can also choose between seven different color schemes. There is a mode that will show your mistakes, which is great for learning and also when you want to figure out where you went wrong. There is also a special pointer mode to make it possible to play 20x20 puzzles even on a small screen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69b/69bf6a6738fa1c04f1a06a2c608595c6.jpg", "website": "http://clevermedia.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["CleverMedia"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["CleverMedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
