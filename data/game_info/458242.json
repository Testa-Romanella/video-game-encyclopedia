The controllers are the side arrow keys and the space bar to jump. There is a secret boss at the end if you get to the castle. The different color blocks can be broken. And to kill a Strawberry hit it on the head, if you don't then you will lose one health. You have 5 health points when you start. From one prize blocks one can get 50 points. And from the coin one cant get 10 points. Also, if one kills a strawberry one would get 10 points. The lava would kill you automatically. But you would respawn.\u00a0This took a long time to publish.  Also, one can get extra lives every time you get to 150 points. Playing time is about 8 minutes. Hope you like it and here are the credits.\u00a0</p><p>YOUTUBE:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyN9RRrCNrHyMNjKfZMDCOw</p>\n<p>Background music:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/djgriffin/sounds/172561</p>\n<p>Boss Music:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Sirkoto51/sounds/443128/</p>\n<p>Health Sound Down:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Prof.Mudkip/sounds/386862/</p>\n<p>I Got some of the pixel art images from google searches.</p>\n<p>And all other help from here: </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T04:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b7/4b7603956c056dc18d693640b2a33518.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["happymz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
