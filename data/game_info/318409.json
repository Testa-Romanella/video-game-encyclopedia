The main idea of the game is simple: there are four gold tiny statues. You have to collect all of them. Then the door to the traveller\u2019s house will open and you will get to the next level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut, as we know, travelling like that you should remember \u2013 it isn\u2019t so clear in our life\u2026 On your way to success there will be lots of traps and obstacles. You are the one who\u2019s going to make decisions and act. So, it will depend only on you what will happen to your hero: find treasure or die. There is no the third thing.
