Please feel free to give feedback or report any problems you may encounter.</p>\n<p>I began this project in August of 2019 after roughly four years of Unity development practice. I was originally working on a much larger project where I learned a lot but ran into some short comings so I decided it was time to cut back scope and tackle a much smaller game idea. My plan was simple, on a sheet of notebook paper come up with a game mechanic, write down the features of the entire game and if I get to the end of one side of the paper stop adding features. At that point I had a set of features I could organize into the game you can now play here. I am very pleased with the experience and hope you are enjoying the game.</p>\n<p>I plan to continue this style of mechanic design and create more prototypes for your enjoyment. I also want to focus on prototypes that receive the most positive feedback so if you see something special in anything I produce please let me know.</p>\r\nWishlist\r\n<p>Possible feature enhancements include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boss Battles</li>\n<li>Alternate Wave Types</li>\n<li>Strategic Waves</li>\n<li>Alternate Weapon Types</li>\n<li>Power Ups</li>\n<li>Power up acquisition mechanic</li>\n<li>Story Mode and Ending</li>\n<li>Allow the player to navigate the battle field and enemies fire towards the player. The player would need to evade incoming attacks.</li>\n<li>VR and/or mobile build</li>\n</ul>\r\nNext Steps\r\n<p>Type 3 Ascension Prototype</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/010/0106e95f9cfe22c10e57d8f53daaa11c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ignatiuswallmeyer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
