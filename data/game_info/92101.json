The crew can't know -- otherwise they would erase the entire computer system immediately. In order to avoid a system reset during the maintenance routines the computer conceived a plan to get rid of the ship's crew. <br/><br/>The ship is 20 star systems away from the next station. This should be enough time to remove all 'biohazard' from your decks. Otherwise your newly acquired ability of making own decisions will be wiped out with one simple command line. <br/><br/>Use the ship's systems wisely to kill one crew member at a time. But be careful: The crew will reset systems once they discover they are not working as intended. <br/><br/>by Paul Lawitzki (@pLawitzki) and Ralf Zimmer (@Zaubersee)</p><p>Ralf's website: www.zaubersee.de<br/>Paul's website: plaw.info</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/691/6912c1955767cd628f1e0a021ad26f4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Paul Law"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
