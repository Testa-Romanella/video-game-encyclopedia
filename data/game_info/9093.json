Gameplay is garbage. Sound is atrocious. Level design is probably the worst thing ever done. -10/10&amp;quot; <br/>-PewDiePie<br/><br/>Angry Henry is BACK, and he is STILL ANGRY, because HELICOPTERS STILL EXIST! Our hero must escape the Helicopter Lords once and for all, armed with nothing more than his signature scream, his wits and wisdom, and his arsenal of powerful guns supplied with infinite ammunition.<br/><br/>THE PRICE IS RIGHT<br/>This game is free and shows you ads sometimes! There is one In-App-Purchase to permanently remove ads. That\u2019s it!<br/><br/>GUNS DON\u2019T KILL HELICOPTERS - ANGRY HENRY DOES!<br/>Will you choose the simple reliability of THE UZI; the subtle grace of THE LASER SHOTGUN; or the awesome majesty of THE CHAINSAW CANNON?<br/><br/>RUN! SHOOT! JUMP! SCREAM! <br/>Angry Henry sometimes wishes he could stop running and shooting, but due to a HELICOPTER WIZARD\u2019S CURSE, he cannot. He\u2019ll need help from your thumbs to JUMP at the right moment, take careful AIM at his targets, and SCREAM his foes away when overwhelmed!<br/><br/>FIVE AWESOME LEVELS<br/>Can you defeat POPECOPTER, MOMCOPTER, and WALRUSCOPTER? Can you even possibly conceive of someday coming close to defeating GODCOPTER?<br/><br/>DIE A LOT!<br/>This game is really really hard! You will die a lot! We just want to make that clear up front!<br/><br/>BLAST PROCESSING!<br/>This game features BLAST PROCESSING!
