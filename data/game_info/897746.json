When global resistance movement Nevermore targets the di\u00a0Museum in the Jongro District of Seoul, you, as a covert agent of the MNI, are tasked with investigating and disrupting their operations. Evade or stun guards as you make your way into the museum and its second floor security room!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I'm Didi Kim and this is my first Unreal Engine 4 prototype, developed over 28 days for the GAM-207 Information Technology and Digital Games class at Southern\u00a0New Hampshire University. As the course content was primarily an introduction to Unreal Engine 4, the final project was very open-ended. I\u00a0took this to mean \"begin work on the game you've been dreaming of creating for more than half your life\". Because of course I did.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I eventually go back to this project, I will hopefully have a lot more experience in both programming and scope management. Please enjoy this early look and let me know what you think!\u00a0<strong>Thank you!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:36:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28c/28cab727a9efd12ae8fe01e654f19c88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Didi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
