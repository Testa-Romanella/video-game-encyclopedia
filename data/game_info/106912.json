The axolotl is a neotonic salamander that can regenerate almost any part of it's body that has been damaged (even its brain!). While in the wild, axolotls never grow out of their juvenile stage, but when placed in specific artificial environments they can transform into an entirely new salamander never seen in the wild!</p><p>Just like the axolotl, the narrative of this Twine game has the potential to take many forms, and can recover from any action you deal out to it. Every action you take has the potential to completely change the universe.<br/><br/>Despite its popularity as both a pet and a medical resource, axolotls are teetering on the edge of extinction in the wild.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f5/9f56bf8daa305c225c08ff49b05690d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joffeorama"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
