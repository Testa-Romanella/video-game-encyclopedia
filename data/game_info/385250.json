The ice is crumbling around them, and below the arctic waters killer whales lie in wait to feast. At the end of the day only one penguin will remain, but which one will it be?</p>\n<p>A four-player co-op physics driven\u00a0party game, players take control of one penguin each on a crumbing glacier.\u00a0\u00a0As the ground beneath them crumbles apart players must either knock each other off, avoid falling pieces, raise up their hands and party to death, or twiddle their flippers and hope to go unnoticed. The last player who remains wins the game!</p>\r\nXbox Controller Controls:\r\n<ul><li>Left stick to move</li><li>(A) button to raise the roof, woot woot!</li></ul>\r\nCreated as part AIE's Battle for Train Jam\r\n<p><em>https://itch.io/jam/bftj2019</em></p>\n<p>Students had to create a game over the course of a school week (21 hours)\u00a0to demonstrate their jamming and cooperation abilities.
