{"id": 62298, "slug": "rainy-day-racer", "name": "Rainy Day Racer", "name_original": "Rainy Day Racer", "description": "Rainy Day Racer is a 3D time-attack motor racing game set in a Scottish city where it rains all the time, all the time, just absolutely hammers it down every effing day. Physics are arcadey and forgiving, with no collision damage and gently railroaded drifting. Rattle round the city a few times until you can keep off the pavement and avoid the lampposts, then upload your best times and ghosts to the leaderboards for a bit of friendly competition. There are 3 vehicles, 3 courses (one bit is shared between two courses, so maybe more like 2.8 courses), 1 halfway-interested commentator, and 1 beautiful woman model who'll twirl and hold up a sign with your name on it if you set a good record.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f7/0f73d74278840232e5ddffb4df520b11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["illegaldogs"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["illegaldogs"], "esrb_rating": null}
