Following reports of radioactive material contaminating the area, Billy goes to investigate. What will he find?<br/></p><p>This game is honestly not the best. The dash feature is a bit buggy, though not too bad. The main issue is the camera switcher- there is a big where if you stand right inbetween a switcher it can get confused on what screen you're supposed to go to, and switches the camera incorrectly. Try not to dash too much near borders. I\u00a0would have made a level two, but building the switcher and dash took so long that I\u00a0didn't.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T17:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc1/fc118f70f1c6234c2f6188631d5748d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SaltyLily"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
