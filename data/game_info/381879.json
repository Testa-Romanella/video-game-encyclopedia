Starting with nothing and as nothing, you select from 4 playable spirits to fight your way through purgatory. Move your soul with WASD and aim projectiles with the mouse. Attacks are fired along a timeline, which can be used to rearrange new projectiles to create unique attack combinations. With original artwork and music composed by Team Ghost members Skawly and Conduit, Soulbound leaves the player with an eerie atmosphere in an otherworldly realm.</p>\n<p>http://ghostinthetoast.com<br/></p><p>LD45 page - https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/soulbound<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T07:55:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64ed0a2addd06ee76e0c38024c77ccd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghost In The Toast"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
