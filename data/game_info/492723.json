{"id": 492723, "slug": "lightning-defense", "name": "Lightning Defense", "name_original": "Lightning Defense", "description": "<p>Lightning Defense is a game made for the Weekly Game Jam 165 with the theme \"One Button Mash\". It was the first game jam I ever participated in.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Click to shot a flash out of the cloud.\u00a0Space to pause the game. You can mute the music using the mute music button and you can also go to the shop by clicking onto the gold icon in the top right corner.\u00a0If you can't shoot the flash pause the game and then unpause it again!</p>\n<p>Goal:</p>\n<p>Kill as many enemies as possible before they destroy the wall. Don't let the enemies get behind the wall. You can upgrade your wall in the shop and make it higher or more wide. \u00a0The enemies get bigger after the fifth wave. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Browser Game Instructions:</p>\n<p>If an error appears while trying to run the browser game, just close the error message and the game will load.\u00a0If you have troubles playing the game in your browser you can also download it for Linux, Windows and Mac. Sometimes it happens that the game pauses when you shoot the flash, either keep your mouse cursor close to the grass or to the clouds then this won't happen. If the back button in the\u00a0tutorial doesn't work in the browser game you can just reload the page after reading the tutorial. All of the other buttons should work properly.</p><p>There will be a video about how I made this game on my YouTube Channel on Monday \u00a014.09.2020 2:45 p.m. (British Time Zone). I will link it here when it is public. You can also subscribe in order not to miss it:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYPyTvDB8WURqKaPJ4k8O0w?sub_confirmation=1</p>\n<p>Good Luck and thanks for playing my game! :-)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T13:46:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/aff86625ddb48b0f54ed0be1617b94af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Shiny_Emerald_Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
