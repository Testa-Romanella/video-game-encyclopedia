The good news is that I did learn some stuff. The bad news is that I underestimated the time it would take to figure out how to program one of these things from scratch in Unity. So, here is a supremely unfinished visual novel. I was planning for it to be about obscure Mario characters, but instead we just have a riveting one-choice story about some placeholder emojis. Enjoy.</p>\n<p>Update 1: Apparently Unity WebGL applications cannot read .txt files, so I guess I have to make it a standalone downloadable application. Ain't that just the way.</p>\n<p>Update 2: Apparently it's not doing it in the standalone app either. Gee wilikers. I guess you'll just have to trust me and the cover image .gif on this one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ad/7ad805d24fd0e1ddd26007acc1da35f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Colin Amos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
