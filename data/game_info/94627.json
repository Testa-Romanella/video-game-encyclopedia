As you master its logic, Induction aims to rewire how you think about cause and effect.</p><p>Across more than 50 meticulously designed puzzles, you must explore the counter-intuitive possibilities time travel permits. You will learn to choreograph your actions across multiple timelines, and to construct seemingly impossible solutions, such as paradoxical time loops, where the future depends on the past and the past depends on the future.</p><p>Induction does not pander, but gives you the satisfaction of mastering an imaginary yet honest set of physical laws.</p><p>Accompanying Induction's minimalist visuals is a rich and responsive ambient soundtrack by Melbourne-based electronic composer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist, Tim Shiel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/912dca1f8e585286de42d1108012b46d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bryan Gale"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
