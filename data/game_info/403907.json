The game is in an extremely pre-alpha state, which means that right now it's basically just a prototype to demonstrate the basic concepts. However, a bunch of cool core concepts are up and running:</p>\n<ul><li>Procedural ability generation:\u00a0the spells and abilities you use in the game are randomly generated and (mostly) unique. Mix and match the best abilities you find to create your ultimate build!</li><li>Character creation uses procedurally generated abilities to build your character instead of classes.</li><li>Boss fights are procedurally generated, with randomly generated phases and mechanics for each boss.</li><li>The game is open source wherever possible, with the code hosted here:\u00a0https://github.com/caesuric/familiar-quest</li></ul>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<ul><li>Create a character and set its stats! You can mouse over any stat to see what it affects.</li><li>Choose from a set of procedurally generated abilities that are (mostly) unique to your character!</li><li>Select your character and hit play</li><li>WASD to move character</li><li>Space bar to use items in world (like portals or doors)</li><li>Left/right click to aim and use primary/secondary abilities</li><li>Left/right click on hotbar to reassign primary/secondary abilities</li><li>Number keys to use other abilities</li><li>Mouse scroll to zoom minimap in/out</li><li>Enter a portal to generate a dungeon of the level printed by the portal (strongly recommend level 1 at first :) )</li><li>You will acquire new procedurally generated abilities by defeating enemies with a blue particle effect -- this indicates that they are special \"miniboss\" enemies that have unique abilities</li><li>At the end of each dungeon is a boss that uses randomly generated phases that each have one or more randomly generated boss mechanics.</li><li>Each boss will drop a piece of high-quality loot and open a portal through which you can exit the dungeon</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:19:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc6c0fce5a2e1c646336800bdfb2e2b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["caesuric"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
