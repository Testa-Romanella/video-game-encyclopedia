After four years, the investigators close the case. The Smith family hires a private investigator to reconsider all of the evidence.</strong></p><p><strong>One thing that was overlooked was the private computer that Daniel used. Unable to gain access to the contents of the machine, the family in one last attempt is providing a virtual machine image of Daniel's machine in hopes that someone would be able to find his killer.</strong></p><p><strong>I would very much appreciate any help that could be provided;</strong></p><p><strong>James Bishop, Private Investigator, S.R.V.
