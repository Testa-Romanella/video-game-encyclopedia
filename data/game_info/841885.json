{"id": 841885, "slug": "rummys-mini-games", "name": "Rummy's Mini-Games", "name_original": "Rummy's Mini-Games", "description": "<p>A series of desk toy type games demonstrating various fun and interesting game mechanics.\u00a0Background music is all my own work and compositions.</p>\n<p>Press M to mute/unmute music at any time. Press\u00a0N to mute/unmute sound effects and music (in main area only).\r\n</p>\n<p>Press T to reset the active level. Hold O and press 1 through 4 to access each level. If you get stuck trying to change levels try releasing and holding O again before entering the number.</p>\n<p>Main area (1): Press 1 and 2 to toggle between tree and block mode. WASD to move hold shift to sprint\u00a0and press space to jump. Left click to shoot and place randomly generated\u00a0trees or blocks depending on mode. Press J to reset the randomly generated miniature landscape in the center of the level. Press P to delete all placed items.\u00a0Place trees and use blocks and/or buildings to get on top of\u00a0 the\u00a0canopy and walk around. Trees can only be placed on the ground where as blocks can be placed on everything except the miniature landscape.\r\n</p>\n<p>Space area (2): Hold left click to go up and away from the closest planet and forward/back depending on vertical mouse position and left/right based on horizontal position. Right click is the same except down towards the closest planet.\u00a0Hold middle/scroll wheel click to rotate camera view and orient direction towards mouse position. If you hit either planet you die/reset the level.\r\n</p>\n<p>Swimming area (3): Hold Q until a full arm stroke is reached on the left side\u00a0and let go once it is complete\u00a0to push forward. Hold E to do the same on the right and repeat to build velocity.\u00a0Mouse position rotates towards that direction. Use WASD to brake in each direction. Be careful as the arm strokes can swing the character and you will need to orient it with the mouse which can be easily overdone. Also if you go too fast\u00a0you can lose control of the character very easily.\u00a0This is meant to be\u00a0an example of the fun but frustrating player movement/level navigation type of game so difficulty manoeuvring the character is intentional and not a bug\u00a0.\r\n</p>\n<p>Frog area (4): Jump by holding left click with the jump height and distance depending on the length of time the button is held and the rotation controlled by horizontal mouse position. While in the air click and hold\u00a0the right mouse button\u00a0to shoot the frog's\u00a0tongue at a wall or object to quickly drag and rotate towards it using the mouse position to aim. Climb the platforms and try to reach the highest one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T13:28:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de4d17ef3be4866b067a12dfb0734494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mop_bucket"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
