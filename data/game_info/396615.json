I was the sole programmer for this project. My favorite thing I developed on this project was the script that allows for the player move to where the screen is touched. It allows for very fun movement, especially when it was coupled with a 2D ragdoll made by one of my other team members.</p>\n<p>This game was made over the course of approximately 4 weeks by a team of 7 in the Unity Engine Version 2019.2.5f1. The intention of the game was to be a hyper-casual experience where monetization could occur if so desired.\u00a0As a result of this project, I learned how to develop applications for Android.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Join Jim on his first day at a new government job testing atomic trampolines.
