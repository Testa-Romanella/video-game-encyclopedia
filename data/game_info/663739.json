(Sorry, we're all out of other disasters. We have plagues, only plagues).</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>If text is in [brackets], it's a button you can click on.</p>\n<p>You can also click on tiles to select them, which will affect what appears in the scrollbar.</p>\n<p>WASD or the arrow keys pan across the map.</p>\n<p>Shift (either one) will make the panning go faster!</p>\n<p>Pressing the 0 key is for dirty, dirty cheaters. Also debugging. Mostly debugging, really. It's still there, so like I guess you can use it if you want!</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>You'll want to start by building a house (or an apartment if you wanna spend big...) so that you can bring in workers (check out the [Population] screen to do this - note that you have to invite people in using the various [Hire] buttons). Note that buildings can only be built within 2 squares of a road (diagonals are fine), and roads can only be built next to other roads. Each worker must be paid, and will also consume food. So you'll need Farms (run by farmers) to produce food, and either lumberjacks or offices (run by office workers) to earn fat stacks. Offices require some upfront investment for the building, but they produce a little bit more money than lumberjacks.<br/></p>\n<p>Eventually you'll probably want to get some doctors to deal with the constant plagues (see the [Prediction] screen). They'll disable some of your workers so they won't be able to do anything. Of course, you always could just hire more instead. You monster.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T09:06:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6e/e6e8ad650822e75fc20d7ff0ad889626.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dullstar"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
