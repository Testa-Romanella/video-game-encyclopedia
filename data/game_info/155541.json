Whether my Maker is prepared for the ordeal of meeting me is another matter.\" - Winston Churchill.</strong></p><p> The only certainty of life is that it will end. How and when life ends is unfortunately (or luckily) not under our control. We are at the mercy of fate when it comes to the timing of our demise, but what would you do if you exactly knew your time of death? What would you do if you knew exactly the number of heartbeats your sorry existence has got left? What route would you take? What goals are still reachable and do you have what it takes to fulfill your ambitions before the light goes out? </p><p>Meet Moebs, an alien creature that wants to aim high with the short life he's got. The purpose in this game is to get as high as possible within 50 heartbeats. Create momentum, plot the ideal route and reach for the skies!</p><p><strong>Key features</strong></p><ul><li>Intense arcade gameplay</li><li>\"One more go\" addictiveness</li><li>Gamepad support (tested with Xbox 360 controller)</li><li>Simple, yet vibrant graphical style</li><li>Leaderboards </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef7/ef75c582140dcce43f85b445f3d96ba4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Buff Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
