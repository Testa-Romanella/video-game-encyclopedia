Obviously not a awesome game, but I did try to challenge myself work in a full game and I\u00a0did have fun doing it. I\u00a0hated the theme \"free\" but I\u00a0thought that will be fun using it as an actually theme (not \"free theme\", I mean \"theme: free\").</p>\n<p>The music are from internet (free copyright), but all the other things I did by myself.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 HOW TO PLAY/TIPS\u00a0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong><br/></p>\n<p>controls: w, a, s, d, esc, spacebar</p>\n<p>\"Collect free things\" from the stores, eat/drink to not run out of energy, watch out for the dogs and the angry crowd.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You can't walk in the air (while jumping) or move arround while eating/drinking, so sometimes its risk grab things if the dog is coming.<br/></p>\n<p>I found a bug and did the right thing: transform it in a feature. Sometimes when you jump, land in front of a store and grab an item (not necessarily in this order) you \"slide\" to the street. You can return jumping back to the sidewalk (or be hitted by a car, for cheese).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ac/0ac7a92411a187f49d1626a4538ee550.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PedroVLM"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
