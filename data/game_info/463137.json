If it's not, right click the tab at the top and hit \"unmute\" and press escape to free the mouse before left-clicking and capturing it again.</p>\n<p>If you are running the executable and there is no sound, close the game and start it up again and the problem should be resolved.</p>\n<p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move player</p>\n<p>Space - Jump/Continue Conversation</p>\n<p>Shift - run</p>\n<p>1 - Equip primary item</p>\n<p>2 - Equip secondary item</p>\n<p>Left Click - Use item</p>\n<p>Alt + Enter - Borderless fullscreen (for Desktop)</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>This game is a continuation of a series\u00a0made for the Two-Minute Horror Jam, this particular episode being made for the ScreamLite jam. The theme of the jam was \"corporate greed\".\u00a0It's inspired by episodic mystery/horror series such as\u00a0the Twilight Zone, and this particular episode takes heavy inspiration from the horror games\u00a0Afraid of Monsters and Cry of Fear as well.</p>\n<p>This episode revolves around Simon Crummsby, the CEO\u00a0of a small soda company called \"Green Soda\" and his interactions with the conglomerate soda company sCream Soda.</p>\n<p>There are 2 endings, a true ending and a good ending. Upon completing the game, you will most likely get the true ending. In order to get the good ending, I recommend hitting Space to go back to the main menu upon seeing the end screen\u00a0and hitting \"begin\" once more. It will remember your progress and you can begin from the second half of the game to attempt to achieve the good ending. As an additional hint, I\u00a0will say achieving the good ending is as simple as using only the first item or none at all from this point.</p>\n<p>Load times are a little long on the HTML5 version due to this episode being more elaborate than the previous one. It takes about 30 seconds for me to get past the loading screen on Chrome, so give it a minute. Once you're in-game, it will stutter for a few more seconds as you look around, but it will settle and it'll be smooth sailing for the rest of the experience. Alternatively, the game is downloadable for Windows, Mac, and\u00a0Linux.</p>\n<p>All that aside, please enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:52:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/584/5845b18571c51c096dc7a55a963e8ce2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Consistency3D"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
