{"id": 61482, "slug": "zero-sum-future", "name": "Zero Sum Future", "name_original": "Zero Sum Future", "description": "Zero Sum Future is about building a corporate empire in space that can withstand anything that gets thrown at it. Other players trying to muscle you out of the market, a central government levying massive taxes, the people living on the planets demanding more and more goods \u2013 you need to overcome everything. Maybe you lie, cheat, and steal to accomplish this. That's fine. The only rule in this game is: Don't get caught.Colonize an Untouched Star SystemIn the year 2150, faster-than-light travel is a reality. Venture into deep space to build your corporate empire. But the outer reaches of space can be quite hostile, so you'll need to expand quickly by exploiting the resources (and players) you find nearby.Build Across the Entire Solar SystemTurn one planet into an industrial powerhouse, or spread across several planets, snatching up all their natural resources. Or perhaps you just want to make a small fortune selling Burgers on your opponent's home planet. Any planet you can see you can build on, but be careful \u2013 real estate is first come, first serve.Make Money However You WantZero Sum Future offers a variety of ways to make money \u2013 you can sell a basic necessity like Grain, or go high-tech and sell Shuttles. For less scrupulous CEOs, there are also other options \u2013 illegal buildings. They look exactly like legal buildings, but have a different, powerful function. Be careful - if you're investigated, the consequences can be substantial.SurvivePeriodically, the Federation sends are Carrier to your star system. The Carrier auctions off potent Player Powers \u2013 these can monopolize the consumer economy of a planet, or commandeer an opponent's building. But every time the Carrier arrives, it also taxes all of the players an ever-increasing amount, eventually becoming a crushing burden. Does your corporate empire have what it takes to endure while everyone around you is collapsing?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a35/a35395542aba6ed5e1b624e7628362ba.jpg", "website": "https://zerosumfuture.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plungerhorse Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plungerhorse Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
