Pay attention to the HUD (top and bottom) and popups. Move the mouse to the edge of the screen to move the map.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have a population limit, so build houses.\u00a0Archers come from the barracks so the sooner you build one of those the better.

Workers collect resources, build buildings, and repair buildings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T08:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cd360c2581373ca1055200f03c76d04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gary_beebe"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
