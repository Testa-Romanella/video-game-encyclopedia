Easy to learn, but hard to master. The up to 4 player coop mode works very simple via plugn play.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat differentiates my game mainly from the other thousand Twinstick TopDown Horde Shooter: The opponents are difficult to circumvent through the narrower premises and also the AI \u200b\u200bwhich tries to cut the way leads to the direct confrontation. If you do not deal with your abilities properly and keep a cool head despite the high speed, the battle will not win for you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa4e9057bd9a21a5813787719111f796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 108}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 377, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paul Piepenhagen"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Paul Piepenhagen"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
