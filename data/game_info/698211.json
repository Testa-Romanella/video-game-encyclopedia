In this serene game, we hope to do that for everyone.</p><p>We were inspired about our lives during covid, where mental health issues seem to be a growing issue during the pandemic. While we do not want to take away from the reality of the pandemic, we do want to remind people that it is important to remember to rest and take stock of oneself, as resting not only improves your mental health but keeps your body healthier to deal with various illnesses.\u00a0</p><p>As for our game idea, we were reminiscing about older, freer times in our childhood, which brought us talking about an old arcade game \"Burger Time\". This popular game was forgotten and we thought it would be nice to bring back an element of our childhood, and reskin this game to fit with the themes and message of our game.\u00a0</p><p>Remember to take some time to rest and relax, even though you might be stressed or anxious while being cooped at home. Keep yourself healthy in all aspects while waiting out the pandemic. Sleeping is quite important, and our beds are our everyday heroes as they help us recover from our daily ordeals.\u00a0</p><p>We decided to go with this direction as we want to bring a part of our childhoods into the limelight, using the core mechanical game loops in order to retell our message to people around us. All too often have we seen people being burnt out or stressed, and we would like to remind them that it is OK to take some time to recover.<br/></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91e/91e844acbd5a0a858be99991b2c32525.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pentus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
