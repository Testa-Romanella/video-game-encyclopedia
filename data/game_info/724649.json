The conditions through which a user is deemed \u201clow-risk\u201d are not disclosed publicly and are open to interpretation and bias. In this game, players can interact with a modified, parodic version of the Global Entry software to redesign the discriminatory immigration forms used by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The game borrows many visual and textual assets from the Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security, and the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s websites, reports, and social media content. In the final build, the game generates a US immigration form based on the player\u2019s choices.   </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T07:40:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76b6394d96208ce9fb6dac07d273ecad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mbabaee"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
