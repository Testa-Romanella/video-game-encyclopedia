{"id": 158482, "slug": "coin-forest", "name": "Coin Forest", "name_original": "Coin Forest", "description": "<p><strong>Coin Forest</strong>\u00a0is a competition/casual game where two players (beetles) compete for coins that run around in\u00a0the forest. The first who stores 9 coins in his house becomes the winner. By utilizing the car-like movement control, different power-ups and bumping-hit attack strategy, a player will try to become the most wealthy beetle in the world.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p><em>If you had to retake this course and do it all again, what would you have done differently the second time?</em><br/></p>\n<p>Play test the game with more friends and make animation if I have time. Or maybe make a 3D game. I\u2019d also be interested in making a long-term group project instead of an individual one and to see the difference.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Would you expand this game or continue working on this game in the future? Why or why not?</em></p>\n<p>I might polish this game before putting it into my portfolio, but might not make any big chance to the game. This game was based on a simple idea, and a two-player game has is limitation. There are other genres that I want to explore, especially narrative and puzzle. I prefer to explore a new idea/concept if I make a new game, and will probably spend more time thinking about the concept before I start to make it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>In terms of process, has making this particular game changed how you approach making games in general?</em></p>\n<p>Yes. It has gave me a sense of what is the process of developing a game. It is helpful to have a timeline where we put coding/design/polish into different stages. Compared to games I made in Intro to Programming, this game was made in a more organized way. It\u2019s interesting to learn different concepts like \u201cfriction\u201d and \u201cjuice\u201d.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhantomJ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
