This is a\u00a0trial and error puzzle platformer. Press R to restart if you think you're stuck in a level. ESC to go back to the menu.</strong></p>\n<p>Heart is a puzzle platformer taking place in a large platformy world - but you can only view it 64x64 pixels at a time! (I scaled up  the window though don't worry it's not tiny). Heart got lost and they lost their colour. It's scattered around the world! Can you help them find it?\u00a0Heart is a pacifist so there will be no fighting, you\u00a0damn brutes, why can't you all be like Heart?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The puzzles get harder as\u00a0 you go and there are lots of different mechanics to learn - the 'Read Me' page in game gives you a hint as to what each thing does.</p>\n<p>No HTML5 version as it reeeaaally didn't like the fact I'd scaled some stuff and I'm too lazy to fix it this time. Desktop works fine!<br/></p>\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n<p>Complete the puzzle to progress to the next level. There is a level menu where you can select any level you want - I did this so you can skip levels you find too hard, boring, or if you just want to have a look around. Levels will turn green if you have completed them!</p>\r\nDEVELOPMENT\r\n<p>Made in GMS2 in a few days for LowResJam 2019. This jam is a two week long jam, so I\u00a0hear you ask 'why a few days?' WELL I started planning for it, then took part in another overlapping jam and completely forgot about this, until a friend mentioned it too me. Luckily I had 4 days left to get it done\u00a0so, could have been worse!</p>\n<p>One cool thing: the entire game is in one room!\u00a0The camera/player is just locked into the level specific active area. Makes for quite a cool screenshot:</p>\n\r\nBEGGING\r\n<p>If you like it - follow me on twitter!\u00a0I hardly use it but, maybe one day I will, and then we can be twitter friends. -&gt;\u00a0Twittwoo</p>\n<p>If you enjoy - make sure to leave a comment and let me know if you have a game as well. I'll make sure to give it a play!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71f/71fc983cb0bcba475e7379714b383654.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["havik"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
