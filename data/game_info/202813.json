It very much looks like a mod from one of the Gamemaker sample games, however I actually scripted everything myself, from scratch. The game\u00a0used to be uploaded on the Yoyogames website until the site\u00a0was updated and unfortunately taken down. It had a 4/5 star rating and someone actually made a sequel called \"Rush Hour Two Player\" but unfortunately that one wasn't rated that high and you definitely\u00a0could tell it was just a mod from the GM sample game. Looking back, I'm actually quite proud of this being my first game I ever made :).<br/>HOPE YOU ENJOY IT TOO!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f16358af16b3eced7814b9b169e09afc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheAfterWorld"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
