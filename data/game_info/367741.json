{"id": 367741, "slug": "hellbent-hellbentdev", "name": "Hellbent (HellbentDev)", "name_original": "Hellbent (HellbentDev)", "description": "<p>Hellbent is a 2D top-down turn-based roguelite tactics game. The goal of the game is to progress through increasingly difficult encounters while gearing and leveling up your party with randomly dropping gear. Sadly I don't know if the game is fun so I'm having it playtested here!</p>\n\n\n<p>If you like old-fashioned dice-roll RPG games or tactical squad-based games, you might like this game too. <br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay features:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>A challenging turn-based combat system mixed with RPG mechanics to provide a deep and complex gameplay experience with odds-calculation, build planning and number crunching.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Progress through an increasing difficult dungeon while gearing your squad up with with over 260 different abilities and weapons. Each run of the game will turn out a little different.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>A large number of different enemy types that utilize these abilities against you in horrible, horrible ways.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Helpful tips:</p>\n<ul><li>You can hover over just about all the attributes and gear in your character development screen (opened by I or C) to see how they work and how they influence the game.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Sometimes, you have no more viable actions so you have to press the turn by pressing the Pass Turn button or by pressing Space.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>You can enable AI control with a button to let AI control your characters for you. I added this feature mostly for debugging, but decided to leave it for the player to use since it's kind of fun.</li></ul>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>The game's development is still in progress, so there might be some developer oversights or bugs. Beware! Also, I'm using placeholder sounds right now, so I suggest muting the game and putting on some music or something. Graphics are also mostly placeholder stuff, as I am not an artist. If there is any interest, I will continue developing the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T07:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f5/5f56b985d549ed0bab58de06aa3f67ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HellbentDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
