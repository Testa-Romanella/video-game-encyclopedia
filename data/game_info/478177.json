Congratulations cadet, I commend your persistence.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>STORY FOR GAME IS AT BOTTOM\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>(But trust me you won't wanna go there... its worse than the gameplay)\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I am a beginner dev (as you can probably tell) that was working on a 2d platformer...</p>\n<p>When I caught wind of brackeys summer jam 2020_2 I decided to give it a go! The theme was rewind. I implemented it horribly lol but I wanted to make sure I stayed within the scope of what I'd be capable of. To be honest I should've put a lot more work into this and I probably will once I learn more about animations and asset importing. Anyways this was just a stepping stone for me to start from, something to challenge myself to not only learn but to try and actually make something within a week... Well for me I guess half a week lol. Power went out one night, had a lovely day with my girl, and overall procrastinated like I always do, but excuses aside I really had an enjoyable time making this! As for playing it though.... Yeah I just hope I don't waste too much out of your day if you do decide to hit that play button...You can't die or it sends you straight to the menu (from the death screen) because I'm stupid and couldn't implement a re spawn system in time...So I'm really sorry about that...</p>\n<p>Things/bug fixes that didn't make it in but are planned:</p>\n<ul><li>Add Music back in (was getting some odd issues)</li><li>Fix title screen text not showing...</li><li>Actual options menu (right now the main menu one isn't functional)\u00a0</li><li>Reset level button or hotkey</li><li>Make death screen return to proper level instead of main menu.</li><li>ACTUAL SPRITES for age changes\u00a0</li><li>Size changes based on player age</li><li>Better title</li><li>Story explained in game\u00a0(narration or better text solution)</li><li>Actual ending</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you find any bugs, let me know. I'm sure to have them and I'll try my best to fix them!</p>\n<p>The idea/story?</p>\n<p>Well since the theme was rewind I wanted to do some sort of age mechanic wherein instead of growing old, the player rapidly grows younger each second and as such has different abilities/attributes/ and size. I was only able to partially flesh out 2 of these 3 but theres a lot to return to so perhaps\u00a0 I'll pick this back up someday and truly make a game of it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>STORY (TL;DR = You made a bad wish on a mean genie guy)</p>\n<p>\"So you wish to never grow old\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes! Yes as I've said genie! That is my last wish!\"</p>\n<p>\"Well then... your wish is my command\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a fury you are whisked up from your old and raggity former self... YES he's done it! That genie has actually stopped me from growing old! I can feel death slipping away from me... becomming distant...</p>\n<p>distant....</p>\n<p>wait...\u00a0</p>\n<p>what?!\u00a0</p>\n<p>ITS COMING BACK?! That terrible feeling of my morality evaporating?!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\"GENIE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Oh I think you should be asking what you have done...\"</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>And thats basically all I've got so far so to loosely tie it together, you are now rapidly de-aging and will soon cease to exist! BUTTT genie wants to keep you living for his weird tests, so he gives you magical donuts to eat which make you jump ahead 10 years in age. Although it won't stop your existence from eventually ceasing, it could prove to keep you around a little longer ;)\u00a0</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n<p>So yeah this whole thing was kind of a big mess. A lot of fun though and a great learning experience! Many thinks to the community in brackeys discord for helping me and so many others out. Can't wait to jam again and make something well... playable.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:02:10", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lloyds Dev Corner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
