By creatively building your own spaceship, you'll fight your way through space against pirates. On your journey you will meet many different life forms, some with good, others with bad intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter the Earth exploded, the pirates collected the last remnants to generate energy. As one of the last survivors, it is your task to explore the planets. These play an important role in the fight against the pirates, because on them you can mine various materials, as well as trade with the inhabitants to create more components for your rather small spaceship. On your journey through space, it will happen more often that pirates attack you. To progress further, you'll have to defeat them to get money to trade with. When you have enough equipment, you can face different bosses that will test your combat experience. Once you have defeated them, you will receive very special rewards.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nShape your spaceship:<br/>\r\nAs you progress through the game, you will unlock more and more different components, whether through trade or crafting. You can use these to upgrade your ship and make it stronger. In a construction menu, you can build the spaceship as it suits your play style to wipe out the pirates.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMaterials:<br/>\r\nOres and important materials can be mined on planets and exchanged for money to buy other materials or objects, or you can keep it for yourself and collect more materials to upgrade your spaceship without having to buy stuff extra.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPirates:<br/>\r\nAfter a short explanation and briefing from your on-board computer, you'll have to prove yourself in a first battle, but be on your guard. There are different types of enemy ships and each one has special properties as a result, which can quickly make you stagger.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStory:<br/>\r\nThe goal is to expand your spaceship more and more, defeat all the pirates, and in doing so you will encounter different challenges that you must overcome. If you have upgraded your spaceship well enough, you can face various bosses that deliver a completely different combat experience. If you defeat the boss, you not only get special rewards, but you also recapture the stolen parts of Earth from the pirates until you have collected them all. Once you've captured all the pieces of the Earth, you'll be able to patch them back together.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T04:44:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff1b782d5ee7a3d2d5ecc7531852aa2d.jpg", "website": "https://ejn-applications.pages.dev", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EJNApplications"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EJNApplictaions"], "esrb_rating": null}
