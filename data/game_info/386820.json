One player must chase the other before time runs out. If the chasing player catches the fleeing player they win else the fleeing player wins if they don't get touched by the chasing player. Having both players play on the same keyboard does lead to interesting situations where players fight over key detection and playing space to add to the arena feel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21a/21a4af60f1dd46fd1cdf879e4a1ccc5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wesleystander"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
