(It's basically a glorified Demo in it's current form). I'm thinking of revamping it and making it in godot with new art, stages, and a more streamlined control scheme.<br/><br/>You control a kid with an octopus on his head who attacks with ink balls and tried to find cake.. it's gameplay is heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac.<br/><br/><br/>The Sprites were created by me, while the music was pulled from Resistor Anthems. A royalty free album collection made by Eric Skiff.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T08:02:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/578/578be255ea0c1d6d6611532fb90c0d88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hillendymion"], "genres": ["Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
