That can be used to open the first door you see once you spawn. After opening it, there will be a lever you can activate but you notice you cant reach the gate in time most of the time. Heres when you can get creative and use objects to stick under it so when you open it again, something will block the gate allowing you to crouch under. After that look for a key in that room and keep in mind you can grab the locker doors on the floor. After that put a chair under \u00a0the vent shaft and crouch (while crouching double jump) and that should lead you back to the main hall and with the new key aquired, you can open the last locked door. Here\u2019s where you can find the hidden passage leading you to the finale of the game.</p>\n<p>EDIT: with this build, reaching the gate before it closes should be very simple. I noticed alot of people being stuck and never play past the puzzle as it apparently was too difficult in the older builds.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T05:05:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/816077493877ef7a6561922c42f6a730.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madpolygon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
