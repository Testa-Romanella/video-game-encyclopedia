I've messed around with game development a lot before but I rarely ever put the effort into making any sort of finished project. This is kind of the first attempt at that.</p>\n<p>The idea at the beginning was that the character would be going through stores destroying all of the fall decorations that show up way too early, before the leaves even start changing colors. I guess it still is that, but I wanted to have a shop after each level where you could buy the different fall items and use or wear them. So by the end of it you would be a guy who acts like he hates the season coming so early yet embraces it fully. So because of time constraints it loses out on the irony, and there's no reason to actually engage with the game and obtain money/points, except\u00a0that\u00a0there\u00a0isn't anything\u00a0better\u00a0to\u00a0do.</p>\n<p>This also lacks the polish of anything worth releasing (no icon, cover image is just the screenshot). \u00a0There's a lot of ways I could improve my process for next time!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are just Z to attack.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/498/49838d4a3ab7a45ebe52daead7d117fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wally"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
