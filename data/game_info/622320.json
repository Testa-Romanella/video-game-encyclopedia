First come the fiendish Burwors. Then, the devilish Garwors and Thorwors, creatures who seem to vanish and reappear at will. If you're expert with your Laser Blaster you just might manage to stay alive long enough to get a shot at the winged Worluk and maybe even the Wizard himself! But beware, Worrior - his is a fight to the finish! Deeper and deeper into the Wizard's labyrinthine mazes you'll descend...into the Arena and maybe even the Worlord Dungeons! Prove yourself worthy of that honor and you may make it into the Pit, the Wizard's most deadly dungeon with no place to hide!
