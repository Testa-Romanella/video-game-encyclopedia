It is a tablet game base on the physics-based board game Oh, Snap!. Aw, Snap! features the same mechanics as the original game, as well as brutal AI opponents, online multiplayer, data collection for a professor to study the physical interactions between pieces, and variable number of pieces and board size. However, networked features don't currently work because I took down the server.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a0/8a0f9c893f148ea2275adb708f007b4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["srawls1"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
