The game lets you play the role of a young mage apprentice called Nina who miscalculated heavily on how to properly rewind time and instead rewinded...space itself. So she's able to freely rotate the screen to her command.</p>\n<p>Both me (Fermin Fernandez Diaz aka Narthelus) the artist and Ivan Albertti (programmer &amp; game designer) are part of a (fantasy name only lol) group called \"Lionfox\".
