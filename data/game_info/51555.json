Set in a fantasy magic shop, the different mini-games offers a wide set of activities, each one requiring different skills and strategies. The mini-games take the form of simple and short but intense experiences in a colorful, cartoon and absurd environment. Feed a tax collector with donuts, search the shop for cursed objects and try to please what seems to be an endless wave of clients.<br/><br/>Play alone or share your headset with your friends for some old fashioned multiplayer. Be the fastest, the more accurate or just the luckiest to compete for the high score. Or you can just relax and play it casual. Because those who brag about their score are just trying to compensate for something else. And you're not trying to, are you ?The Lore\"Potions, scrolls, magic wands, ancient artifacts, I've got everything you need !\" This is how the owner of the Entropic shop greeted his customers. It was one of the last magic shop ever, a truly marvelous place. It's said that no customer ever left his shop without finding what they came for. As he grew old and tired, he eventually had to hire an assistant to run the shop. Unfortunately, the young man was a bit clumsy and disorganized and sold the wrong potion to a local sorcerer. The sorcerer, furious that his ritual has been ruined, cursed the shop and the assistant.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/957c6d6d8af7d02bb92ed7a106cf1895.jpg", "website": "http://www.entropicshopvr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big Horn Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Horn Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
