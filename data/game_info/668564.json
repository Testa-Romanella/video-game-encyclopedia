Time stops when you stop but speeds up by 10% every 30 seconds. Your goal is to last as long as possible.</p>\n<p>TIME|EMIT is playable in the browser using directional / AWSD keys.</p>\n<p><em>It was largely created in one morning so is very much a mini-prototype!</em>\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nGame per month 4\r\n<p>After releasing my last game\u00a0QuestBall\u00a0on mobile in Summer 2020 I found working on the next project a challenge. Part creative block, part COVID-era issues, the next big idea just never progressed. So I\u2019ve opted to make a series of games, each of them started and completed in a month. That\u2019s a month of spare time, evenings and the occasional working day*. \u00a0I see each of them like a game jam, an experiment, a chance to try out a genre, style or technique. Its inspired by\u00a0Sokpop Collective\u00a0and Rami Ismail's\u00a0Game a Week\u00a0post.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>*This month I opted to try out a series of smaller experiments instead of one project.\u00a0TIME|EMIT was my favourite of those, despite largely being created in a few hours.</em></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Everything is by me,\u00a0Stuart Wallace.\u00a0I'm a Scottish 40-something dad and app creator living near Brighton in the UK. I\u00a0dabble in game-making in my spare time.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The game was made in Unity.\r\n</p>\r\nDonations\r\n<p>This game is 100% free and you're welcome to play it\u00a0as such.
