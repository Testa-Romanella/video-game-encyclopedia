And dangerous things can happen.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tLet me tell you a secret: we are just like one long, tangled scarf.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tLife is scary. We're constantly wrapping up a scarf around our perversions.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAnd this can be scary too.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tIt can be, but it doesn't have to.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tJake and Melissa are, well, just another strand in this colorful scarf.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBut this strand is different from the others.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tIt's like when you're out, hanging with your friends, and the night sets in.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tSuddenly, the cold air freezes your hands. You quickly put them in your pockets, but just when they're getting warm, your neck starts freezing up.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tWrapping up a scarf around your neck would now be the best thing to do.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tAnd you do that. Despite your hands getting cold again.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tNow think about it. What neck could be colder than one caught in a gust of perversion?\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tJake and Melissa are wrapping up their strand around one very cold neck.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tTheir lives are ready to approach the edge.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThey're there to face the threat.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tk\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/507/507a89be3d3797a2f1e5646e29499723.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unknown Developer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
