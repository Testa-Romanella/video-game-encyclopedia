But beware, this farm is The Creeper's hunting ground...<br/></p>\n<p>I never planned on making Scooby Horror 3, but when I bought some Scooby Doo Pop figures (Cause why not) I saw some art on the back of the box, showing a countryside that looked creepy and perfect for a Scooby Horror game. So I decided to mix the environment of the pop figure art with the episode \"Jeepers it's the Creeper\". So here it is, Scooby Horror 3. Just in time as an early birthday present for myself. Hope you have fun, and I hope I at least made this one a wee bit spooky. But remember, this game isn't exactly meant to be scary scary, it just has a  spooky atmosphere and a bit of spooks n stuff like how the show is. The game is kind of meant to be like the show, y'know.<br/></p>\n<p>Also side note: Sorry I haven't been working on Alpha 3 of Dracula's Castle! I've been busy binge playing Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th: The Game last December. I was able to work on this game at random times in December, so it took me a month to make when it probably would've taken me two weeks to make if I wasn't so lazy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T08:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfa/bfa372069e2b4f6cf5498243e5f945f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
