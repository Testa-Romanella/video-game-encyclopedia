Maybe just me. Who knows? The actual game is in development and supports different typing modes than random words and probably more languages, music, etc.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation begins by typing the first letter and ends after 60 seconds. Press \"space\" to cycle to the next word, make sure you write the word correctly since you cannot correct it afterwards. Your results should show up after the evaluation ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>F1- Restart the round<br/>ESC- Exit full-screen mode<br/>SPACE - Switch to the next word<br/>RETURN - Switch to the next word<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:33:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89a/89abbfd0c4dc98638a488f54962de018.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spalt(er)"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
