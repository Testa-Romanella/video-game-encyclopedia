It's a typical a-typical party game.<br/></p>\n<p>Goal of the game is to collect traffic cones and bring them to the drop-off point. Only the 'Stickies' can do this. When a Sticky succeeds, it scores points, but transforms to a 'Bully' as well. Bullies don't collect cones, they chase Stickies. Why? Because the only way to become a Sticky again, is bump one.<br/></p><p>Developed for Xbox360 and released on XBLIG. Works for windows too, although you'll need some controllers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d7867a571690fe77059cf8245d791edc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keeweed"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
