It is the first time too I try pixel art and making computer assisted music. Even if the game is pretty boring and you probably won't play the game more than one time I'm pretty proud of the result. Next time I'll try to clean my code and make prettier graphics and music.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T06:07:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/667c0704e2a4e996425a204b72c7e03a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mino"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
