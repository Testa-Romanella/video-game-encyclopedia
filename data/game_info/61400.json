Something like Johnny!<br/>I also wanted my game to feel like a tribute to the original, since I miss it so much!<br/><br/>There were 6 arches in the authentic game and mine covers the first, settled in a forest and other beautiful places.<br/><br/>To sell without copyright problems, the whole artistic side of the project was made completely by me using Photoshop.<br/>Some backgrounds and sounds were obtained from the internet, but always copyright-free.<br/>Scripting was also developed by me as well as the choice of the game engine.<br/><br/><strong>Characteristics</strong><br/>- There is no possibility to save. This is because I wanted to mantain a certain extent of atmosphere that also the original had (In fact I couldn't save there!);<br/>- On the other hand, this game can be completed in 2 hours if you never lose and are either talented or lucky;<br/>- Movement system is choppy and kinda slow. Again, I did that on purpose because I really enjoyed it back then in Johnny;<br/>- It is not said that a scenario change leads to a more hostic gameplay. It might be, but that's not 100% assured;<br/>- There are some interesting secret passages you might want to find and delve deeply into;<br/>- You'll have a pistol with 6 projectiles and 6 bombs that are needed to go on and survive; you can find supplies for them during the course;<br/>- Enemies respawn if you go back and forth through each screen; keep that in mind and don't waste your inventory;<br/>- Learning the movement system might take a few tries: it's not easy to get into it and might annoy at first. Don't give up!<br/>- You'll start your adventure with 10 lives. To increase your chances of surviving, gather up 1000 points to obtain one extra life point;<br/>- Avoid traps, choose right timings, kill enemies, crouch when needed, detonate bombs to destroy unstable dirt, climb ladders and use moving platforms to go on!<br/>- I reckon this game will be great for the ones who are curious!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96c/96c953fa175b82396087a40dd0c76f79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emakestudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Emakestudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
