Try on the role of a hotel owner and turn it into a holidaymakers paradise!<br/><br/>Your task in this clicker game is to develop the hotel to achieve the highest rating: 7 stars. It is not easy - such an exceptional rating will be given to you only if all the buildings are upgraded to the highest possible level.<br/><br/>Let's see what you can do:<ul><li>Improve the spa facilities: bar, swimming pool, yachts mooring line and so on. Each building produces corresponding services and has two parameters: the Comfort indicator displays the quality of services that a particular construction provides, and the Capacity Index - how many kawaii waifu can simultaneously get such service. Please note that the service staff of the buildings are also girls: the higher the hotel rating is, the less clothes they wear!<br/></li><li>Complete tasks: in-game events and additional tasks cool up the atmosphere and help to achieve the your goal. A well-known producer asks to improve the spa for his women? The World Federation of Otaku wants to make sure that your parking space can accommodate more than 9,000 cars, providing a place for each of their favorite heroines? Well, you will have to do something to please them!<br/></li><li> Get popularity points by competing with other hotel owners. The more stars you have, the more likely you are to take the first place in the ranking and lure all the waifu to your hotel!</li></ul><br/><br/>Don't forget: only girls work and rest in your hotel, and as the resort develops, the atmosphere becomes more confidential and the outfits become more frivolous! Isn't it a good reason to get the 7 stars rating as soon as possible?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85aa7eadb352253a2bf83c99b18c10d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Coffee-Powered Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coffee-Powered Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
