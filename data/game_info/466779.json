Soda is loaded by the bottle into slots in the belt like bullets fed to a machine gun. Back when this method was used machines only sold one type of soda so there was no problem of getting the soda you wanted but with the theme for the game jam being \"out of control\", I wondered what it would be like not having control of the soda that comes out of the machine. That is what this game is based around, you are a server trying to get people the soda they want but you have no control over which types of soda will pop out of the machine so you must set out different sodas, keep them cool, and even mix them to get the customer the soda they want. Sodas can have any combination of 5 different traits: sweet, refreshing, fizzy, energy, and sour.\u00a0There are 9 different sodas\u00a0as well as custom sodas. You can also drink the sodas you mix giving various bonuses (Fizzy resets the cool-down on taking drinks).\u00a0\u00a0Strategy and pacing yourself will be essential to getting higher scores. My highest score was 714 points so try and beat me and leave your highest score in the comments!
