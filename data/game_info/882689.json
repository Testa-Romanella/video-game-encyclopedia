Each realm or world will have its own royal (ex. Snow White, Cinderella, etc.) that is in need of some kind of assistance and your job is to help your character navigate the world in order to help those royals. The game comes full circle when something happens to the protagonist and needs help from the ones they helped in the other worlds to overcome their own needs before it's too late and the protagonist is turned into ice forever.</p>\n<p>Here is where we choose your protagonist, either Firn or Renir.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whomever you choose will direct where your players go throughout the story.</p>\n<p>If you choose Firn, the game will direct you to visit princesses in other worlds/levels. (ex. Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, etc)</p>\n<p>If you choose Renir, the game will direct you to visit princes in other worlds/levels. (ex. Jack Frost, Prince Christopher, Prince Phillip, etc)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that the game is still in the works and needs a little touching up here and there including adding music. If you have any suggestions to make it better, please feel free to let me know.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T19:33:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c88388526e1096f7ecb5ce48be6b4e06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["angelamksmith"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
