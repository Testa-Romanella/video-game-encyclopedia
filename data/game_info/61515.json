Each match begins with a planning session, providing teams an opportunity to gear up, discuss strategy over voice-chat and formalize tactics by drawing directly onto the map - like a playbook. Once the round begins, combat is quick and energetic - with one team on offense and the rival team defending a structure with multiple entry points.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Fresh Scenarios Each Match</strong><br/><br/>Due Process introduces an evolution of the FPS scenario. Maps are procedurally generated, then expertly curated by the development team for maximum fun - resulting in a novel situation within each match, whether the outcome is victory or defeat. Due Process balances the playing field by making it more about outsmarting your opponent than memorizing a map, eliminating the inherent unfairness of \u201cmap knowledge.\u201d With visuals inspired by 90s arcade light gun games like Time Crisis, Due Process uniquely marries neon-retro aesthetics and modern gameplay innovations.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T01:56:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbd414b1fa91e64670664b7f609dadf7.jpg", "website": "http://dueprocess.gg", "rating": 3.08, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 695, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giant Enemy Crab"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Annapurna Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
