The one on the left is controlled with WASD and the one on the right is controlled with the Arrow Keys<br/></p>\n<p>More Rules:</p>\n<p>1. There is only one ball that allows you to score, hit the ball to change it to your color.</p>\n<p>2. If the ball enters a goal while it is your color, you will get a point, unless the ball goes into your own goal, and in that case you will lose a point.</p>\n<p>3. If the Purple glass ball goes into your goal, you will also lose a point.</p>\n<p>4. \u00a0You always control the green players, so the green goal is what you should always try to protect, and other goals are what you should try to score on.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Miraj Alam</p>\n<p>Andrew Marshall</p>\n<p>Colin Magerle</p><p>All sounds in the game are royalty free from freesound.org<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c27417cb47033de98c1799394075f99b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["miraj.alam"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
