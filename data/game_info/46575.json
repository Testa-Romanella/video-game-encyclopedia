The goal is to bring all the cubes to certain points or goals.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe cubes are of different color and their movement is sometimes linked, sometimes independent. In some levels you can move all the cubes at once and in that case you have to plan your movements ahead to create a perfect pattern for them to fit the goals. Solve all the levels and prove you are worthy of being a true puzzle cracker. Do it faster to make it look more impressive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc5362d0bdc70414bce57c1c08e20489.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GooCubelets Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
