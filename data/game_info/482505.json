Here's that version:\u00a0https://blockcabin.itch.io/out-of-your-mind</p>\n<p>This game is a fast-paced high-score based chore completing frenzy!</p>\n<p>Complete chores quickly and correctly, in the minigame boxes on the sides of the screen. The game speeds up as time passes, making the game more difficult, and making you have to multitask more and more as time goes on!</p>\n<p>This major post-jam changes:</p>\n<p>Higher resolution - Easier to control your cursor and grab objects, getting rid of a lot of frustration! (Also room for better graphics!)</p>\n<p>Difficulty select - Something that we wanted in the jam, but didn't have time to. This makes playing the game how you want so much easier! Difficulty also impacts your score, so more chances to get new high-scores!</p>\n<p>(Coming Soon) Highscores - A feature that any high-score based game should have, the game remembering your high-score!</p>\n<p>(Coming Soon) More minigames - :o</p>\n\n<p>This is still super early in development, and so many stuff still have to be adapted to the new resolution. We still want to redo all the art, add a ton of juice, minigames, levels, a leaderboard, and so much more!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>BlockCabin (Code) -\u00a0Youtube\u00a0-\u00a0Twitter</p>\n<p>Haylo (Art) -\u00a0Youtube</p>\n<p>Cinder (Moral \"Support\") -\u00a0Twitter</p>\n<p>One royalty free sound from\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:29:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9e/f9ecd865c7ded0c4fb36341a22d1e8cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlockCabin", "Arcane Jello", "Haylo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
