We both liked the end result, but I wanted to try a different style of vertical shooter. Years ago I owned a pizza restaurant and I had a 1942 arcade table, which I played a lot! Here is my 1 day attempt to remake it using the above tutorial as a base. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a simple wave manager in place that pulls wave data from a string. There are a few different spawn 'patterns', and support for me to easily add more.\u00a0So far, only one level is in place and there really isn't much going on. Ideally I'd love to have a high score table, way more levels and more complex patterns.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:11:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb0/bb0bdd635e0c2613cdec348c872c2dd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VengantMjolnir"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
