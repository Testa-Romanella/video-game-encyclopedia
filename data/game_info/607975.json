An RPG that uses CD10 (TTRPG by Tobias Linder)\u00a0rules for combat and out-of-battle-skills and interactions. So basically, a video game with tabletop game mechanics.</p>\n<p>Features a homebrew setting:</p>\n<em>A post-apocalyptic Earth, roughly 200 years after the end of WW3. Humanity has somewhat recovered from the societal collapse following the devastating fallout of atomic bombs, but faces several struggles. Modern technology is no longer universally available. Armed conflicts for territory and resources are an everyday occurence.<br/></em>\r\nNotice\r\n<p><strong>There is a known bug that talent checks sometimes crash the game.\u00a0</strong>I'm looking into it, and as of version 0.14a it shoooould be fixed hopefully. If your game crashes, it's probably that. I put autosave points in the spots where talent checks are right now, so you should be able to recover your progress from the autosave if it happens.</p>\n<p><strong>The storyline can currently be played up to the store visit. </strong>There's no way to leave the store right now, so just save your game there and you will hopefully be able to continue from there in the future.</p>\r\nGame Features\r\n<ul><li>Non-linear character progression without levels</li><li>No character classes, system of \"talents\" and \"traits\" instead</li><li>Dice-based combat and interactions</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T06:40:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ae/8ae109b8f841d67f8d0f6b73b156b5e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artyrambles"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
