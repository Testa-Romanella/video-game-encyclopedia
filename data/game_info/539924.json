You don't lose your rings when hit like a normal sonic game so you definitely wanna pack a lightning shield or 2 sometimes. As you travel, you are going to speed up making things harder and harder the longer you survive!</p>\n<p>Controls for PC<br/>W / Up arrow = jump<br/>S / Down Arrow = roll</p>\n<p>Controls for mobile<br/>click the jump icon = jump<br/>click the roll icon = roll</p>\n<p>For people that need a place to store their code for later, i have made a studio so you can put your saved data code there. https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/28437065/</p>\n\n<p>PLEASE note that this game is best played on pc's and may suffer on some lower end devices</p>\n<p>this game is very new, so bugs/glitches may be present.
