Help the echidna escape its maze-like burrow by solving puzzles to activate the portal in each level and fight back against the moles!<h3>Timeless Gameplay</h3>Push and pull blocks into matching tiles to activate the level portal in over 60 levels of classic puzzle goodness. Use your wits to optimize solutions and aim for the lowest scores and time possible.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Traverse the Burrow</h3>The moles have dug an elaborate burrow that contains many obstacles the echidna must overcome. Utilize switches and warps to tackle unpassable walls. Traverse through ice and mud, which change how the echidna can move blocks. Work with paired blocks, which move in tandem. These obstacles are more common as the echidna progresses throughout the burrow, and they often combine to create increasingly complex puzzles.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Boss Fights</h3>Every now and then, the echidna will have a run-in with the moles and get a chance to show them who's boss! These unique levels add a hint of action to the puzzle-solving done throughout the burrow.<h3>Free/Libre</h3>Maze Burrow is free/libre software, and each purchase comes with the complete source code, allowing for unlimited modding potential. It's every modder's dream!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T23:13:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb357dbf108f1b4d6a39c1527cd6272.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Thomas \"Kimimaru\" Deeb"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Thomas \"Kimimaru\" Deeb"], "esrb_rating": null}
