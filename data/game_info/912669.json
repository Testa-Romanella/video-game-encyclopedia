Your task is simple: get there by any means necessary.\u00a0Your abilities can include the power to double jump, slide, and wall jump. Use these powers to maneuver your way past obstacles and reach your destination.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Welcome to \"The Little H,\" a game that lets you build and play levels. In the level creator, you have a variety of tiles, tools, and options to mess around with and create levels with. It's basically just Mario Maker but for computers.<br/></p>\r\nNote\r\n<p><strong>THIS GAME IS STILL UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0There are a few main features planned on being added but will probably take a while to implement:<br/>-Better looking GUI<br/></p>\n<p>-A built-in campaign<br/></p>\n<p>-Easier custom level sharing<br/></p>\n<p>-Audio (This one's going to be done soon, I just need to implement a not bad audio library)<br/></p>\n<p>-Maybe online support (think the Course World from Mario Maker)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0If you find a bug, report it and I will try to fix it. If you want to suggest a feature, say it and if I think it belongs in the game I'll include it.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:03:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd4/dd453136483b5584a46deaec06709f6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AshQuimby"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
