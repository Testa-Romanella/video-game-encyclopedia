During the first test of the Gravity Glove, a serious anomaly occurs that puts Evens in a parallel world of the space station. With the help of the Gravity Glove, he must now find a way out of the anomaly that will otherwise corrupt him. As the protagonist Evens, the player explores the abandoned space station Daedalus to find new paths and information that will bring him closer to the solution.</p>\n<p>Team: Connor Zimmermann, Laura K\u00e4ppner, Kimberly Knei\u00dfl</p>\n\n<p>No installation needed.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Homepage</strong>:\u00a0https://connor.gallery/beyondanygravity</p>\n<p><strong>Official Website</strong>:\u00a0https://beyondanygravity.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Sound effects obtained from</strong>:\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Known issues:<br/></p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0 Texture pops in sometimes\r\n</p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0The rotation of the player does not work properly (rarely)</p>\n<p>Please restart the game or return to the menu.</p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0Inverted gravity control\r\n</p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0Heavy frame drops in the large test hall\r\n</p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0The menu sometimes cannot be controlled via the controller\r\n</p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0Elements are loaded uncleanly</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T11:19:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d070ffa4301ae7b19e46b9516702ea7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoJa"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
