It has only two enemies and four plants and only one playable biome. It was a great learning project. Enjoy and I will be glad to hear any feedback. Thank you.</p><p>How to play:</p><p>After starting a level just click a defender from a menu on the bottom and place him on an empty square. For that you have to have enough money (the yellow currency), which is produced by the sunflowers. The green number on the top is player's health and when it reaches 0 player looses. The health can be changed in the options using the difficulty slider. Enjoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T14:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5a/a5a986198ec3ae1dbfd1ce36c41eaa58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nixelone"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
