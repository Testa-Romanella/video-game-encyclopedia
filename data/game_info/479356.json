Her parents are going away for a week of sun and surf in Bordeaux, and Marnie has been palmed off in her grandmother\u2019s care in the backwater English village Fenchapel.<br/><br/>Marnie isn\u2019t much looking forward to her week in the sticks. Fenchapel is a small village with a population below 500, without any shops or cinemas. Marnie\u2019s sure she\u2019ll be bored out of her skull \u2013 and then, there\u2019s her grandmother\u2019s continued ravings about fairies.<br/><br/>\u201cDon\u2019t venture too far into the forest,\u201d Grandma Iris warns. \u201cThere are strange creatures in there, and if they find you, they\u2019ll never let you leave.\u201d<br/><br/>Of course, Marnie ignores her grandmother\u2019s warnings. Fairies don\u2019t exist, after all \u2013 and Fenchapel is so tiny, what can she do other than explore?<br/><br/>And so, Marnie wanders into the forest\u2026<br/><br/>While exploring, Marnie happens upon a young female knight in a glade, clutching a sword. The knight has been sleeping for many centuries, but Marnie (inadvertently) awakes her. The young knight calls herself Leofe. She does not know why she went to sleep, but she knows that the forest itself is plagued by a horrible curse, and she is the only one who can lift it.<br/><br/>Together, the two young girls go on an adventure. They learn of Fenchapel\u2019s storied past, and with the passing days, their feelings towards one another grow.<br/><br/>Fenchapel, as it transpires, is far more interesting than Marnie imagined.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>85,000 words of text (approx 4-6 hours of reading)<br/></li><li>A kinetic story with no choices or branches<br/></li><li>Detailed character and event artwork<br/></li><li>An entirely original soundtrack<br/></li><li>A sweet yuri love story<br/></li><li>A cute female knight!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T19:19:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/997/997b7aedbb583078e8d43dd38c789058.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ebi-hime"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ebi-hime"], "esrb_rating": null}
