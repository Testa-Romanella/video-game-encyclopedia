We took the brief \u2018unstable\u2019 and decided that each platform can be broken by Trebor\u2019s tremendous ability to crumble rock as he blasts from the ground. Be careful not to sabotage your ascent by using Trebor\u2019s ability too flippantly. Objective is to reach the top and use Trebor\u2019s ability to defeat the Geol Guardian that resides there.</p>\n<p>Space = Jump\u00a0</p>\n<p>R = Restart\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>M = Mute</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T06:36:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/9121df3efbd806808bb2e996d8e79c73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CaptainGrue"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
