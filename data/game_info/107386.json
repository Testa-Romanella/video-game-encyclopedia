{"id": 107386, "slug": "cross", "name": "Cross", "name_original": "Cross", "description": "<p><strong>Cross</strong></p>\n<p>Find your way through each level along a path of geometric shapes!</p>\n<p>You leave an inpassable trail on the shapes wherever you walk, so be careful where you tread.</p>\n<p>But also keep an eye on what is ahead! A trail will remain on a shape wherever that shape may appear! If you're not careful, you could block your own path!</p>\n<p>-------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<p>- Arrow Keys: Move</p>\n<p>-\"Pico-8 O\" button: Undo (Z on most keyboards)<br/></p>\n<p>-\"Pico-8 X\" button + Arrow Keys: Move camera (X on most keyboards)<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Theme</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I have attempted to match the \"Dual Purpose\" theme in the following ways:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 Moving also leaves behind a trail that you cannot pass through.</p>\n<p>- The trails will not just appear in the distinct puzzle you are in, but also any puzzle where the corresponding shape appears</p>\n<p>- Later on, the trails will also conduct electricity to activate platforms the player may walk through, though I would have liked to explore this mechanic more if I had more time.</p>\n<p>-------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Retrospective<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Sadly I was rushed for time and only incorporated a handful of levels and mechanics. The electricity is introduced too suddenly and the last puzzle is likely too big a step up, though I do think it's quite fun. I've had little chance to test for unintended solutions or to see how fun it is to actually solve the puzzles.</p>\n<p>Also had to leave a few visual quirks, such as electrified trails remaining that colour until the player undoes their moves over them.</p>\n<p>Upon waking up the following morning, I have also realised that the middle puzzles have unintended solutions that are much simpler than the solution I anticipated. Whoops!</p>\n<p>Edit: And a friend just showed me a much simpler solution for the last level too!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Cross was made by Juner using Pico-8.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e28/e28d4a30d000191d5d0b8df08081beb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["juner"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
