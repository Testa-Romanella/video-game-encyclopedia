We chose to retain Borderlands' visual presentation, environments and first-person elements while setting them in Pok\u00e9mon's universe. Pok\u00e9mon's team-managing aspect was converted into an autonomous \"squad\" of pok\u00e9mons which can be captured, healed and leveled by fighting.</p><p>Sadly, we didn't have anybody on our team who knew how to animate in such a short time, and we couldn't use animation websites like Mixamo due to most of our Pok\u00e9mons being very different from humans.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a0560e22f787d1be1209f8ea13d614e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baggs"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
