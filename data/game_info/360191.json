I split the game into 2 distinct phases, Explore and Escape.</p>\n<p><em>Explore</em></p>\n<p>In the explore phase, the player must traverse a maze-like dungeon full of enemies, but they have no weapons to fight them, so must use skill to sneak around enemies / dodge incoming attacks. During this phase of the game the player feels powerless, since the only action they can do is run away.</p>\n<p><em>Escape</em><br/></p>\n<p>Once the player finds the sword, they move into phase two. Rooms now behave like\u00a0Zelda-like\u00a0boss rooms where all enemies must be killed before allowing the player to move on to the next room. This phase is all about providing the player with some\u00a0catharsis and letting them finally fight back.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Ideas</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Thief Enemy<br/>Introduce a new class of enemy that can steal the sword from you. Once they steal it they run away and hide, switching the player back to the <em>Explore</em> phase.</li><li>Sword Rack<br/>In the main menu, show off all the swords you've managed to escape with.</li><li>Difficulty<br/>Create more difficult dungeons &amp; enemies that potentially scale with the number of successful runs.</li><li>Randomly generated dungeons</li><li>Polish: The combat &amp; movement controls\u00a0are pretty garbage</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T17:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e305028bb8478a2f76fb430452a69139.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Young"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
