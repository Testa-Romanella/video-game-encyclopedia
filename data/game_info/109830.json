Scour the plane for clues, and try not to piss too many passengers off on the way. Play through a full campaign loaded with minigames and jokes, like parachuting, bocce ball, and punching a fat guy on a toilet, or just play the endless minigames on their own after a single playthrough. Even after you play through once, try it a second time to explore extra paths through the nonlinear storyline.</p><p>The game has no set price, especially since it is only a work in progress demo, but if you want to support the development of this game and make sure it gets finished without me starving to death on the way, I sincerely appreciate every bit. Every bowl of ramen counts as one more night I won't have to stop development to fund myself through gainful employment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ac/1ac05377455f17b329b079aa1b94dd75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AuggoDoggo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
