Participating in a game jam and not finishing? I've been in this place before!</p>\n<p>Even though I didn't finish, I'm very happy with how far I got. I approached this jam with the intention of learning something new, namely 3D. Although I have dabbled in it before, I never made something big in 3D so I wanted to use this jam as chance to check out the whole process of modelling, texturing, shading, rigging, weight-painting and animating.</p>\n<p>I made good progress, but in the middle of the jam the gears in\u00a0my head were already smoking, not from working too hard, but from constantly learning new stuff. In other jams I worked two days on something that I'm good at, but I've never done a month long learning session like this.</p>\n<p>I got to\u00a0rigging the body but not the face and again, I'm really happy with how far I've got. Things that seemed like black magic at the beginning of the month are now second nature and I've learned more new things in this time than the entire last year combined!</p>\n<p>As usual I overscoped and in the end I knew that wouldn't get anywhere near my goal, so I just wrapped it up in something silly! Maybe I'll finish this down the line, but for now I'm happy to do some 2D drawing and pixel-art again. Still, it was a blast participating and I'm already looking forward to next year :D</p>\n<p>Please check out all the other contributions to the Strawberry Jam and rate the ones that actually finished on time!</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Onnis</p>\n\n<p>Song is Deja Vu by Dave Rodgers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T16:37:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d6/4d6a1dc59cc6f7aa87fc7225a6c8f2a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Onnis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
