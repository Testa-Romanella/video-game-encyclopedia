You write the name of an animal/object into a magic notebook, and watch as it appears before you in 3D using AR technology! Certain animals will interact with each other in different ways. They may attempt to eat each other, flee from each other, or fight each other depending on their species.\u00a0The app is early in development, and as updates roll out I plan on adding many more animals. The full list so far is:</p>\n<ul><li>Walrus</li><li>Rat/Mouse</li><li>Duck</li><li>Penguin</li><li>Shark</li><li>Crab</li><li>Rabbit/Bunny/Hare</li><li>Cat</li><li>Dog</li><li>Snake/Cobra</li><li>Frog/Toad</li><li>Cheese</li><li>Bread</li></ul>\n\n<p>Google Play and Apple App Store links will be coming soon, as soon as Google approves the app and I get around to making an iOS version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:40:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/311/3116941805dcaf5d0d9a763b196acd75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["ROSSCO Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
