This six months I have been thinking about how to design a new game that can go beyond it, more able to challenge the limits of human intelligence. After dozens of program attempts, I seem to find the way.<br/><br/>The source of Chinese civilization wisdom is Tai Chi of I Cing, it uses the most simple yin and yang conversion to explain the secret of all things change, thus affecting the Chinese civilization development for thousands of years. I have been thinking about how to make such a thought can be understood throughout the world as a simple game, so that everyone can experience this ancient wisdom, infinitely changing from simple changes<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Swipe to select some dots.<br/>Click the Tai Chi to change the color of the dots.<br/>Change all dots to into the same color.<br/><br/>In the testing process we found that the Yang levels of the game is relatively simple, but the difficulty began to rise sharply in Yin leves, I even suspect that no one can solve the last level. Last week, More than 130,000 Chinese testers, no one can solve the all levels. So I made a \"most expensive purchase\" to remind you that it may be the world's most difficult puzzle, I hope you can solve it with your own brain.<br/><br/>Forgive my poor English :)<br/><br/>Sleeeeepfly Studios<br/>Yufeng Long", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9af/9af1006bdfe19f319baf57016089b5b9_KEJPktR.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SleeeeepFly Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Beijing SleeeeepFly Technology Co"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
