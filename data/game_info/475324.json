{"id": 475324, "slug": "one-more-level", "name": "One More Level", "name_original": "One More Level", "description": "<p>Github: https://github.com/Bozar/OneMoreLevel<br/></p>\n<p>One More Level is a turn-based Roguelike game made with Godot engine. The GUI font, Fira Code, is created by Nikita Prokopov. The tileset, curses_vector, is created by DragonDePlatino for Dwarf Fortress.</p>\n<p>Every time you start the game, One More Level presents you with a theme dungeon of unique mechanics and goals. This idea comes from HyperRogue, one of the most bizarre and fascinating games I have ever played. You can beat the game in five minutes, so it never hurts to go down just one level deeper.</p>\r\n\r\nKeybindings\r\n<p>Godot engine natively supports keyboards and gamepads (Xbox, DualShock and Nintendo). Xbox buttons are shown in square brackets below.</p>\n<ul><li>Move: Arrow keys, Vi keys, ASDW, [Direction pad].</li><li>Wait: Space, Z, Period (.), [A].</li><li>Help: Esc, Slash (/), [B].</li><li>Reload: Space, [A].</li><li>Quit: Ctrl + W, [Select].</li></ul>\n<p>Edit data/setting.json to enable wizard mode.</p>\n<ul><li>Add 1 turn (Wizard): T.</li><li>Force reload (Wizard): O.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nCore Mechanics\r\n<p>As mentioned above, every theme dungeon has a unique winning condition. Press Help key to read it. The help text is also available in doc/. You lose the game if running out time. Remaining turns are shown on the upper right corner. However, there is always a way to gain more turns. You may also get killed by other causes in a dungeon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:29:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18c/18cdf6767a4be99a89e6d202ec8b8e53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bozar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
