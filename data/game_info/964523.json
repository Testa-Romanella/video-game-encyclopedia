But we all start somewhere.</strong><br/><br/>The year is 2323. Thirteen years ago, the Earth was attacked by an invasive alien species. They used a superweapon that altered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, causing intense weather changes in the space of hours, creating hurricanes in jungles and blizzards in deserts. They made no attempts to communicate. Humans had taken to calling them \u2018riklid.\u2019<br/><br/>And today, the humans won. The riklid retreat after being dealt a decisive blow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You play as Ezra Foy, a young twenty-something coming out of their senior year at university. For Ezra, it feels like time had stopped: the war effort was all anyone could focus on, and now that peace has finally been won again, the time for revelry and relationships has begun. Choose between three love interests, each with their own deep branching storylines and hundreds of lines of dialogue; enjoy a futuristic setting involving people and places of all different walks of life, including a friendly lizard-like alien species known as the Ghians; and decide what the best course of action should be living in a post-war era, and what we as individuals can do for our future.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br/><ul> <li>Professional voice acting.<br/></li><li>Three love interests to pursue.<br/></li><li>Original soundtrack by The Word Of Lawder of Sinvicta fame.<br/></li><li>Beautiful hand made art.<br/></li><li>Choices that matter. <br/></li><li>A variety of endings!</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-07T02:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bd/8bdf409f4afa9b1260d7f07a8189dfdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LunaticMoon"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LunaticMoon"], "esrb_rating": null}
