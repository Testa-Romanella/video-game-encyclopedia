With only a certain amount of triggers try to get rid of all enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Use your logic skills to defend the Kingdom against the evil forces. If a level seems too hard, you'll get hints automatically.<br/><br/>Multiplayer mode and more levels upcoming if there are enough voices calling for it ;)<br/><br/>You can try the Playtest version for free.
