At first it was supposed to be a outstanding game, however maybe we dreamt too big. Anyway, lots of lessons were learned. <strong>Feedback will be greatly appreciated!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0In this prototype, you play a Archer and you hunt a big slime. And that's about it. Also, it is very buggy, so I say sorry beforehand!</p>\n<p>\u00a0The controls are:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move;</li><li>Z or Up to jump (you can double jump);</li><li>X to dodge;</li><li>C to attack;</li><li>Home to respawn.</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0Also, you can do sort of a triple jump by double jumping and dodging in air, following <strong>i</strong>mmediately by another jump.</p>\n<p>The softwares:</p>\n<ul><li>Engine was the Godot Engine;</li><li>For the graphics, I used Krita and Sklaiser used Photoshop.</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0The credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Sklaiser did the sprites for the player and the monsters;</li><li>His sister did the sketch for the thumbnail art;</li><li>I did the rest (coincidentally, all the bad parts): the code, tilesets, and level design.</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0Finally, you can check the code and assets\u00a0here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c56/c5668371ad9503bf040a2e23ff6f115c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Delta Key", "Sklaiser"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
