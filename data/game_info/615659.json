You swing your paddle left and right in order to push the pieces towards the evacuation shafts, gaining some of that precious little time before the play area inevitably spills and it's game over.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\"A</strong><strong>h<strong>a\"</strong></strong>, I hear you say, <strong><strong>\"so it\u2019s a physics puzzler of sorts!\"</strong> </strong>And that is correct. You can play it alone or with a friend in multiplayer, you can go at it in short bursts or try to crack those elusive high score spots. <br/></p>\n<strong>Here's what's included: <br/></strong>\n<ul><li>A single and/or multiplayer experience</li><li>Six power-ups to help you get through the evolving levels of difficulty</li><li>The\u00a0option\u00a0to add faces and expressions to pieces, turning them\u00a0from cold shapes\u00a0into cute little geometrical\u00a0folk\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Versions for Windows, Linux, and Apple. *</li></ul>\n<p>Speed, difficulty, controls, sound, and music are all customizable. By default, you use the <strong>left and right arrow keys</strong> in a singleplayer or when playing as player one in multiplayer, while player two controls their paddle with the <strong>Z and X keys</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>We want to continue improving the game, so if you have any ideas about what we can add or fix in future version</strong>s drop us a line.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I know times are hard, so don't worry about leaving any money if you're tight on cash. Just download the game and have some fun with it, maybe even share it with your friends and help spread the word.</p>\n\n<p>* See this section on compatibility and troubleshooting for various platforms.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T07:03:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65f/65f9ff14345ef6096dcc88add29e9eda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mechanical Ink"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
