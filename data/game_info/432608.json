The more you pray for the dead the longer you'll last against the mist!</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus Ending</strong></p>\n<p>The game on its own is a complete short story, however for those who are curious and want to know a *little* more, I've constructed an unlock-able Bonus Ending that may tie up some loose ends! to unlock it you must pray for all 37 of the people that Mya comes across!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trouble keeping count? no worries, when you save/load the game there is a counter keeping track:<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Important Note</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOT FOR THE FEINT OF HEART. What I mean by that is this game has a very morbid setting and, quite frankly, plot line. It is not a cry for help on my part, it was more so an idea I had last year and completely freestyled during this jam until it became this and I am honestly proud as this is MY FIRST GAME EVER RELEASED.<br/></p>\n<p>There are heavy death-related themes, pixelated gore and suggestive topics lightly touched on. Please be advised before playing the game or even looking at the screenshots (however the screenshots are a perfect example of the extent of what this game offers, the theme doesn't get \"darker\" than whats seen below). THIS IS NOT A HORROR GAME, and is not meant to offend or depress anyone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:18:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4f/a4f48f90591ece0674b8146aa857b828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ConflictX3"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
