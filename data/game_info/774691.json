{"id": 774691, "slug": "i-h8-ur-face", "name": "I H8 Ur Face", "name_original": "I H8 Ur Face", "description": "I H8 Ur Face is a modern stress and rage management game. Why let the rage build until it has real world consequences when you can load an image of your target onto our dummy and release the beast....don't have a face you hate? Then just smack the crap out of our stock target and feel the rage drift away with every swing. Take screen shots of the beat down. Choose from bare fists, Boxing gloves wrapped in barbed wire, Brass Knuckles or a Baseball Bat. Spit on the target. With damage on you get to beat the target until it pops or turn damage off to just keep hammering it. You can instantly pop the target at any time. Don't let your stress and rage fester....manage it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*For entertainment purposes only*", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T03:46:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e1/6e12bd9df82954bd0647b045d8f0fcbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Wagner"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Tom Wagner"], "esrb_rating": null}
