All that humans know is that they are trapped within a large metal structure that is technologically beyond their understanding. Many creatures roam through the structure, most of them unfriendly. The few settlements humans have formed are pretty well defended, but don't have much in the way of resources. Your job is to send out groups of humans, and/or things that once were human in search of necessary resources, fighting off against whatever this world throws at you along the way.</p>\n<p>This is a tech demo, there's probably gonna be a bunch of bugs. If you find any, PLEASE tell me so I can try to fix them. There are many gameplay features that have not been implemented yet, such as loot, leveling up, equipment, and multiple different places you can explore besides the default map.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T11:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79f/79f619cdf981f9d3a3709bb03d2a2f97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["whiterobot210"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
