{"id": 643459, "slug": "big-boss", "name": "Big Boss", "name_original": "Big Boss", "description": "<p>A short game made in a short time by three people for the VR Jam 2021.<br/></p>\n<p>You take the role of the giant boss overseeing an office full of miniature employees. Hire new employees, assign them to different roles, and if you see that they're not efficient enough, fire them by throwing them into a trash can. Also, don't let the IRS see your tax returns.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Triggers - grab</p>\n<p>Primary button - teleport</p>\n<p>Left / Right stick - turn<br/></p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Push the big red button to hire new employees. Assign them to their job roles by grabbing and putting (or throwing) them on a table, if there are free cubicles. Collect money they make by putting your hand near them when a dollar icon is floating over them. If an employee doesn't make enough money, take him and fire him by grabbing and throwing him away. Aim for the trash can to earn extra morale for other employees, if you hit the hoop as well, you'll get bonus cash. When the tax declaration spawns, grab it and bring it immediately to the shredder or you will lose money. Earning the target amount will spawn a \"continue\" button which will take you to the next level. Check your watch often to see how much time you've got left.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Attributions:</p>\n<p>https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/comic-cloud-smoke-zoom-lines-background_3819...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T03:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec7/ec7cc575188d787756210e253a9ac9ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["wojtaj", "lonnie", "Broseten"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
