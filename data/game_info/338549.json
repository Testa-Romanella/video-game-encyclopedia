Greyhead studios is happy to present to you the never aging patience game classic, Klondike solitaire. Played with a 52-card deck which is divided into 7 piles of cards with one upturned card at each pile, each pile contains one more card than the last.<br/> <br/> <br/>The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with two and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:<br/><br/>Turning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.<br/>Turning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ad/5ad8c43c71b61854acce1266630dbdcb.jpg", "website": "http://www.greyheadstudio.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Veronika Medvedeva"], "genres": ["Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Veronika Medvedeva"], "esrb_rating": null}
