Stay on the path or suffer the consequences and get sent back to your last checkpoint! A rather infuriating title, this game will make your blood boil and should only be played by the most patient.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Collect coins to unlock new skins, accessories and hats, and have fun blasting through extremely difficult levels. Each level can be beaten in 30-40 seconds, but that will not happen quickly. Your countryball will suffer humiliation as the narrator laughs at your every failure! Play through ten exciting and varied levels; visit ice caps of far north, race through American deserts, and run through a Caribbean island full of explosive barrels!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T02:31:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7db/7db148eaea9678e55658b5d681f03f10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Redkar"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Redkar"], "esrb_rating": null}
