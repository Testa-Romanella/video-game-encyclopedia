Odile Lai is not a girl, but a bird, and she has been captured by the EMPEROR OF PEARL to become his ROSE BRIDE. Needless to say, after being forcibly trapped in a humanoid body when her true form is the heavenly creature known as THE BLACK SWAN, she is a little bit traumatized. And very much furious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who can help her escape before the wedding?\u00a0None other than THE FIRST GIRL-KING OF ERL. That is, if Odile can manage to find her.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS:\u00a0\u00a0</strong>You can't replay the game w/o clearing your browsing data, I'm not really sure why this happens or how to fix it yet.
