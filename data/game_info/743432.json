Conveniently, she is more than eager to spread her legs for anything with a penis and fertile seed. Thanks to her warrior pride, she has taken the noble goal of repopulating her race upon herself; at least with half-breeds in this case.The game starts off with Mikami heading to see her friend, and also client. She has been hired on by the church to help them fight off the demons that have been plaguing the land recently. Mikami, being a fully licensed and highly recognized warrior, is perfect for the job. Well, when she is not busy hopping on dicks for the future of the elven race, that is. After some initial dialogue, you are given your first job and sent on your way after the first demon on the church\u2019s hit-list. I suppose it is the least she can do, considering this is the same church that generously accepts all the orphan half-elf babies Mikami pops out of her oven, throughout the course of the game.\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-22T01:06:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e2/9e2e9558924b50483f61054fad84bc1a.jpg", "website": "http://butakoma300g.livedoor.blog/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
