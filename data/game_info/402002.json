What do we do when week by week, day by day, we see them slipping away from us? We can hide but how long for? How long until we accept what is happening? <strong>The slow fall into silence</strong> is a game\u00a0about that moment when we're forced to stop hiding and accept\u00a0the a loved one is going to pass.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The slow fall into silence</strong>\u00a0is the fifth chapter in my <strong>One day at a time</strong> series.\u00a0The series was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order. <strong>The slow fall into silence</strong>\u00a0is based on the 2013 theme of \"the sound of a heartbeat\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:10:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b7/2b7e5098530fd19d4bf3d8766b4a3dd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
