I'd love to come back to this in the future though.</p>\n<p>Music once again made by me, crushed with lo fi filters to suit the graphics.</p>\n<p>The graphics were a bit tricky to work with since i couldn't convey much having being limited to 4x4-16x16 sprites in order to fit the screen, but it was still fun</p>\n<p>But yeah, that's about it for my first jam, I was a bit nervous, and despite losing some motivation along the way I'd say i'm pretty proud with what I managed to release</p>\n<p>also note that i tried my best to iron out bugs but i can't get all of them myself without proper playtesting, so yknow</p>\n<p>Now for some tips :\u00a0</p>\n<p>1- M to mute music (Very buggy)</p>\n<p>2- In the pause menu, toggle guide to see pointers to where the exit checkpoint is (hand placed by me, that's why they look so shoddy)<br/></p>\n<p>3- If you've given up and just wanna see the ending, hold Shift and press L</p>\n<p>4- Press Tab to toggle the points counter</p>\n<p>Thanks for your support<br/></p>\n<p>-StringThing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T05:19:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5b/b5b2c4d64504ebb73ec2f4d2d62d4ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StringThing"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
