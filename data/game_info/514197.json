The object is simply to escape the mansion. As you explore the mansion, you can find masks of the various monsters that inhabit it. Wearing a mask will make monsters of that type have a harder time noticing you. Standing still will make it harder for monsters to see you with partial cover.</p>\n<p>A helpful hint for starting out: Monsters don't trigger the traps, but they can be killed by them<br/></p>\n<p>I've added post jam versions with fixes for three bugs that I ran into when I actually played the game. \u00a0The jam version is beatable (I've finally beaten it). There are two places where you need to just get lucky with the AI. Also there is a room where you leave out a right exit, and the screen doesn't change. That's because you aren't out of the room yet, but you are out of the camera's bounds. just push right for a bit, and then hold down. There are no monsters there, and you should quickly be out.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: Arrow Keys or WASD</li><li>Pause: Esc</li><li>Select Menu Item: Enter</li><li>Toggle Masks: ZXC or JKL</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Programming: Me</li><li>Original Art: Me and George Schulze </li></ul>\n<p>Attributions:</p>\n<ul><li>Most of the environmental art is from https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors by LimeZu.</li><li>The Music is \"The Crypt Loop\" by Michael Klier https://www.m-klier.de/</li><li>Sound Effects from bone666138, Little Robot Sound Factory and other public domain sources (I love you\u00a0https://opengameart.org/)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:30:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d871c955fefdb3c21c44134946d2680.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["CatDraggedIn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
