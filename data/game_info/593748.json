He doesn't know where he is; he doesn't know how he got here; he doesn't know when those creatures will find him, but when they do, he'd better be ready to fight back. He can run, jump, attack, and wall jump through the strange landscape before him, but he can only hope that will be enough to find his way back home.</p>\n<p>The official Halloween 2020 installment of the Spoopcore series (never mind the actual release date), this is by far the most ambitious thing I've ever done. A difficult 2D platformer with a grindcore and death metal soundtrack where you're hunted down through the game by mysterious monsters. Find the secret bunny if you can :).<br/></p>\n<p>Spoopcore 1: https://cosheena.bandcamp.com/album/spoopcore</p>\n<p>Spoopcore 2: https://cosheena.bandcamp.com/album/spoopcore-2-spooped-to-death</p>\n<p>OST: https://cosheena.bandcamp.com/album/spoopcore-3-ost<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T06:27:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8a/b8a4e3f99959fa2641223d7d0cec5e0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MsBasilisk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
