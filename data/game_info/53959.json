{"id": 53959, "slug": "monster-party", "name": "Monster Party", "name_original": "Monster Party", "description": "<p>Monster Party is a video game for the NES, released in North America in 1989 by Bandai. It was and remains a relatively obscure platform game for the console, having a small following among some players. The game both pays homage to and parodies horror pop culture, alternately featuring enemies and locations based on classic horror icons, and parodic reinterpretations.<br />\nIn the 2000s the game became infamous in online gaming circles when prototype screenshots of a Japanese Famicom version known as Parody World: Monster Party (\u30d1\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc, Parodi W\u0101rudo Monsut\u0101 P\u0101t\u012b) began circulating showing different bosses and parodies. No version of the game was ever released in Japan. On May 26, 2011, a prototype of the canceled Japanese release was listed on Yahoo! Japan auctions, closing at a very high price of \u00a5483000 (approximately $6000 in American dollars). On July 3, 2014, the unreleased Japanese Famicom version was leaked online.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-06T15:43:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/901/901ef76594d7e940eb4aacd3e160dba5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 331, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Human Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Bandai"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
