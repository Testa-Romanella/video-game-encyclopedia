MadScientist</strong>.\u00a0</em>As you wake up, you realize you\u2019re running late for school, but alas, you realize it\u2019s a Saturday, and you\u2019re actually missing out on your deliveries! You quickly rush over to your boss\u2019s pizza shop , to find the <em><strong>Dr. MadScientist</strong></em> (your boss, no relation) working up a new concoction which will ensure the survival of his pizza buisness: fresh, 1 minute delivery pizzas...during an apocalypse which he started! (What more could a survivor wish for than a fresh pizza and protection from zombies?). When you deliver these pizzas, your clientele will have been extremely impressed by the quality of your tricks, the fact that you saved them, and their oven-fresh pizza, so the speed of your delivery, and any tricks you do, will contribute to your tips and your score counter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In order to aid you on your deliveries, the Scientist offers you chemicals and tech of various prices, which you can purchase with the tips you make from your deliveries. Throughout your deliveries, however, you will come across difficult terrain as a result of the ongoing apocalypse, and many of your clients will have difficulty delivering your payment, as a result of boss enemies.\u00a0Will the zombies eat your brains, or will you see the money gains?</p>\r\nControls:\r\nGrounded\r\n<ul><li>W - Jump</li><li>D -\u00a0 \u00a0Right</li><li>A -\u00a0 \u00a0 Left</li></ul>\r\nIn Air\r\n<ul><li>Down Arrow - kickflip</li><li>Left or\u00a0Right\u00a0Arrow -\u00a0nosegrab</li></ul>\n<p>The skateboard can block any projectiles while tricking</p>\n<p><strong>Misc.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>F - Confirm</li><li>Space - Use Item<br/>\n</li><li>F1 -\u00a0 \u00a0 Fullscreen<br/>\n</li></ul>\r\nWhat went right in development?\r\n<p>Some of the features we are particularly proud of are our movement and collision system, once we added slippery slope physics the gameplay really began to feel satisfying. This allowed the skateboarding feel to come alive in the game. We didn\u2019t stop there, with our trick system it ties together the complete skateboarding experience, you can perform a classic kickflip and use the nosegrab as an attack or as a shield to block projectiles. Our unique boss fights add a new level of challenge to the game and change up the gameplay to help alleviate the feeling of repetitive obstacles. Most importantly our group synergy was great, everyone was able to rely on each other throughout the entire process of the games development. Each week we would come together and the combination of everyone's work made the game begin to feel more whole as each meeting passed. Our teamwork was on point.\r\n</p>\r\nWhat went wrong in development?\r\n<p>We came across a number of issues in our development process. Aside from the typical coding issues a few outliers stood out above the rest. We had a single sprite that was used as decoration crash the entire game. Once it was removed and replaced everything worked perfectly. Next we cut an entire boss fight because it simply didn\u2019t add anything fun or exciting to the game. We came across some issues with our shop where every time you would buy an item the amount that would be subtracted would differ.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nWhat did we learn from this?\r\n\r\n<p>We learned the joys of creating your own collision detection system. The important lesson that frame rate affects everything in gamemaker. In the coding department we used the method of code now and fix later and found this to be the most effective method for our group. We learned how to work together as a team effectively and how to balance everyone's skills to create our end product. Finally we learned about crunch time, when the finish line is in sight it's impressive how much work and productivity can be achieved in the final days before a launch.\r\n</p>\r\nWhat did we change?\r\n\r\n<p>We had a number of changes through our development process. Most notably was our movement system, we were originally going to have the player fall off the skateboard and enter a \u201cboardless mode\u201d and have to retrieve the board without getting hit, but after much discussion we found this may ruin the fun of the game. The boss fight we scrapped sounded fun on paper but when it came down to it, the fight was basically a timed level inside a timed level. This was our rival skater enemy that simply didn\u2019t add value to the game. Another change that affected our gameplay was how we implemented the shop system, our original design was going to add in purchasable armor and different wheels that affected gameplay. After some sound advice we decided to rework the shop and simplify the idea. We ended up with powerups you could purchase and hold until you need it in the next level. This opens up the pocket feature we added to be used with the shop to store the powerups you purchased. We also scrapped our slowtime powerup due to the difficulty it would cause to implement it. We did a major overhaul of our final boss fight. It was originally going to be a mix of all the mechanics of the previous boss fights, but we decided to give it some originality. Finally we decided to add an elite zombie enemy to add some variety to our obstacles.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n\n<p>Credits for Resources:\r\n</p>\n<p>Powerups\r\n</p>\n<p>Gold Feather:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/gold-feather\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Shield:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/shield-2\r\n</p>\n<p>Pizza Slice:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/pizza-sprite\r\n</p>\n<p>Cloud:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/cloud-2\r\n</p>\n<p>Tutorials:\r\n</p>\n<p>Shaun Spalding :\u00a0Collision\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/478/478e1cd73527ed49a4ffd6ce666e5447.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phoenix", "Inkyubyte", "boneyard94", "dpjj2002"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
