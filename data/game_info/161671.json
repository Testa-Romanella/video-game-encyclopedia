We have designed a simple prototype where the players will have to go around a park and encounter different emergency\u00a0situations. Then they will have to perform simplified first-aid tasks\u00a0to help the people in need.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Different to\u00a0\u00a0prototype, our concept would be a time based game and players are required to react quickly in order to save as many people as possible. This\u00a0allows players to memorise all the different steps while quickly reacting to different situations.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Designers</strong><br/></p>\n<p>@Andyesign<br/></p>\n<p>@thecuriousyeti<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66eca77de6ef5e9e4d4a96d72c1356be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andyesign"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
