It's your job to cross the country, gathering troops to free the terrified population. Start with a bunch of Civilians (armed with nothing but hope) and Solders to train them up:<br/><br/><br/><h3>Recruit Your Militia</h3>Will you pick the Soldier who will turn your citizens into hard-bitten troops, or the Succubus, who will turn them into power-leeching Vampires? If you dabble in the occult, bring along a Priest to channel the power of your Undead. Backed into a corner by Nyarlathotep? Deploy a Tactical Nuke to concentrate your militia's attacks into a single mega blast. Sure, it'll turn them into Radioactive Waste, but that's how you get Mutants.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Game-Breaking Synergies!</h3>Once on the battlefield, 25 of your troops will deploy randomly. You have no control over where they go, which means that it's the composition of your militia that's most important. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, but the important bit is the synergies. Recruit the right combination of troops, and you'll probably kick giant boss butt. <br/><br/><br/><h3>Whom Can You Recruit?</h3>Civilians, soldiers, giant rats, horny beasts, aegises, sirens, nautiluses, whales, improvised explosives, Crimson Terrors, Aracks, stone golems, Varroa Destructors, weredragons, water, radioactive waste, tinkers, game developers, lawyers, priests, paladins, altars, mad scientists, nuclear bombs, medkits, strength serums, power-ups, wills o' the wisp, gold dragon eggs, gropers, gold, gold dragons, skeletons, scrap metal, robots, mecha, mutants, mutant fusion, mutant colonies, mutant juggernauts, zombies, fungal spores, giant funguses, ghosts, hell portals, hellhounds, doctors, anarchists, empty cannisters, alchemists, red dragons, sheep, heavy machine guns, slimes, dire wolves, archers, rat kings, death worms, monster hunters, cloning chambers, succubuses, vampires, writers, librarians, bookshelves, books, mimics, paramedics, chemical drums, barbarians, grenades, recyclers, EMPs, grey goo, focus shrines, phoenixes, hydras, fire, capacitors, box jellyfish, element beasts, cockatrice eggs, cockatrice chicks, cockatrices, bioweapons, oozes, greater oozes, mammoth oozes, unifier machines, captain flags, stasis rings, dog catchers, power pellets, roman candles, time bombs, graveyards, secret chests, claymores, monkey gods, Trevor, whiskey, seed pods, cycad sprouts, cycad tendrils, cycads, Venus flytraps, Venus mantraps, silver, randomizers, webbing, Great Equalizers, steam, djinni, deep ones, garbage collectors, towers of retribution, Internal Affairs Officers, cornucopias, tax accountants, hyperchargers, extra lives, extra health, reavers, ascetics, hustle goblins, berserkers, apprentice thieves, journeyman thieves, mirror demons, pacifists, golden goo, diversity demons, Idols of the Dead, Arks of the Covenant, laser frogs, engineers, sacrificial spam, holy cows, recruiters, Darrrrr(s), panthers, ferrets, giant birds, convention halls, androids, demonslayers, green hands, Terra Creepers, Ion Stalkers, aaaaaaaaand Replicating Spiders.<br/><br/>Did you read all that?
