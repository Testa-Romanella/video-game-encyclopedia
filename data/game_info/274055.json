This is my first time participating in such event, also my first time working on 2D game in Unity3D (damn you OnTriggerEnter2D!)\u00a0</p>\n<p>The theme of LD43 is <em>\"Sacrifices must be made\" -\u00a0</em>I've had some ideas, like - you sacrifice time spent with family/loved ones for work/drinking/watching videos etc. But I didn't know how to transform that idea into game.. So the game I created in the end is kinda darker.. With more blood and death. Yet maybe it's less depressing that the \"time sacrifice\" game.</p>\n\n<p>The game is kinda gory.. so if you are not into that, don't play it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0haven't had too much time to create this game (for sure not 72 hours\u00a0:(), this was my first jam, my preparations were shit (my fault!) and <strong>I\u00a0have used assets (graphics, music, sounds)\u00a0made by others </strong>(allowed by LD).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will add links to 3rd party work soon! (When I get some sleep)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Assets (I will try to add all, if I forget some, please, lemme know and I'll add them asap):</p>\n<p>Gfx:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/2d-archers-sprites-18748</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/mighty-heroes-rogue-2d-fanta...</p>\n<p>https://ansimuz.itch.io/gothicvania-cemetery<br/></p>\n<p>some 2D platformer pack I\u00a0cannot find :))<br/></p>\n<p>Sound:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/ghost</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/impact</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/swish-bamboo-stick-weapon-swhoshes</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/3-melee-sounds</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/falling-body</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/ghost-monster-voice-moaning-growling</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/footsteps-leather-cloth-armor</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/fps-placeholder-sounds</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/fantasy-sound-effects-library</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/11-male-human-paindeath-sounds</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/heartbeat-sounds</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/impact</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/8-wet-squish-slurp-impacts</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/37-hitspunches</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/rpg-sound-pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fb/1fb9bcf8377b00e88ff3eff1a6801fe1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Cipery"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
