Zoom around the apartment and collect musical notes which wake the human up. Avoid the human\u2019s hands which try to press the snooze button \u2014 a single press will end the round. For some reason the hands are inexplicably big and even-more-inexplicably not attached to a body, and yet-even-more-inexplicably they fall out of the sky, but don\u2019t worry too much about it.\r\n</p>\r\nPlatforms &amp; Controls\r\n<p><em>You Are The Snooze Button</em>\u00a0is a WebGL game written in JavaScript.
