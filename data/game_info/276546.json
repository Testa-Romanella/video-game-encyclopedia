I've made countless game in the past, but this one has always been worked on in between and behind those. In high-school I took a generic video game design course. I eventually found myself becoming immersed in the idea that I could actually create my own game. This project became a huge part of my life for 3 years. I put more than 3000 hours of development into it. But, I found I had a much larger vision for it than I original imagined. So, I brought it back down to Earth. Aether takes about an hour and a half to beat, but I've made\u00a0that experience an incredible one. Enjoy.<br/></p>\n<p>P.s., The Game only runs in windowed mode, at least on my testing platforms. If it runs in fullscreen for you, awesome! If not, I'm sorry my past self was too stupid to know how to properly build a video game. On top of this, I'm SURE there are loads of bugs just waiting to emerge. I've polished this up as much as I can. Thank you so much for reading - Have fun.</p>\n<p>P.P.S., I've updated the UI of the game. If it looks different than the screenshots - that's normal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bb924e7e3e454d6c3764946753308d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TurboKiller"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
