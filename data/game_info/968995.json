When his sister, his sole remaining family, is inexplicably kidnapped, this retiring and passive youth decides he's lost quite enough and resolves to take his destiny into his own hands.<br/><br/><br/>From the scorching deserts of Casper comes this wily and free-spirited adventurer, hot on the trail of a series of kidnappings she's been tasked with investigating. When her path crosses with that of Otto's, the two team up in the spirit of mutual interest. But the appearance of such a stalwart ally seems almost too good to be true; just what other motivations does she harbour behind her lovely face and disarming smile?<br/><br/><br/>A certain incident in a magical forest thrusts the presence of this adorable, disagreeable creature into Otto and Switch's reluctant company. Living for thousands of years has granted Echo a wealth of knowledge and wisdom, but extracting anything of the sort past her dismissive and haughty personality may well prove to be an exercise in futility.<br/><br/><br/>Probably born to be a teacher, Otto's sister Bronwyn decided from an early age that her goal in life was to give every child in the isolated valley where the two siblings reside a proper education. Being kidnapped has thrown a considerable wrench into these plans, and being separated from her younger brother, the apple of her eye, has left the usually altruistic and patient young woman in a foul mood that she won't hesitate to visit upon her captors.<br/><br/><br/>A cruel and capable warlord from the harsh northern steppes. A successful military campaign has placed the land of Byron and its long-suffering people in the palm of her hand, but also left her unsatisfied, existentially bereft, and quickly sliding into indolence and hedonism. The stage is set for this slumbering beast to be roused from her stupor, but who can say whether good or ill will come of it?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T23:55:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bc/6bc0948f59e540b689841b643fcd804a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 499, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["envelope"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["envelope"], "esrb_rating": null}
