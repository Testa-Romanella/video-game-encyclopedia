Do you have what it takes to be victorious?\r\nPlaying the game is easy! All you have to do is choose whether you want to go it alone or with a friend and then do whatever it takes to survive level after level of horrifying action and adventure. Once you've started the game, you can play it anywhere; home, in town, at school - wherever Xenu's spooky creations find you! The fun never ends!\r\n</p>\n<p>Be careful, though: Xenu is a man of honor, and once you've decided to take on the challenge, you can't stop until\u00a0<em>someone</em>\u00a0emerges the victor. Manage to get through with all your body parts intact, and you'll be the coolest kid in town. Lose, however, and you're at the mercy of Xenu. There are no extra lives in\u00a0<em>The Chronicles of Xenu: Remastered+</em>, and no second chances. Get \"Game Over\" - and you're done!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T07:52:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e86/e86b9e66f7ea6dcc4fdba30037519831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ehurtt13"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
