Create and customize your own Paper Mario battle! This is a sequel to an older project of mine made back in 2016. Looking back at it, it wasn't very accurate to Paper Mario's battle engine and had a lot of glitches. This time it has minimal glitches and much more involved and polished gameplay.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>-Sprites from mariouniverse.com</p>\n<p>-Sounds from the Sounds Resource and project PMO</p>\n<p>-Some sprites by me</p>\n<p>-Music from Nintendo and Intelligent Systems</p>\n<p>-Mario by Nintendo</p>\n<p>-All coding by me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T06:24:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6a/f6a903e65801bcc2c1353ba1739732ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gameryashu"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
