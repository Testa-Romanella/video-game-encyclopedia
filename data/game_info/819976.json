Why, conning them out of their money with your very own pair of Mimic\r\n      Dice\u2122! Step right up to our stand to scam and cheat your way through the wonderful world\r\n      of nighttime street gambling, where you and your (not so) trustworthy mimic dice work together\r\n      to rid the world of the plague that is integrity and fair play! But watch out! Between hungry\r\n      mimics and a suspicious world both sniffing you up and down, you have to stay smart and stay\r\n      subtle in order to successfully con, scam and cheat your way out of poverty, otherwise you\r\n      just might get eaten by your own dice. Or maybe the crowd will wizen up to your dishonest ways\r\n      and refuse to play with you, which leads to you running out of money and then surprise! You\r\n      get eaten by your own dice! In hindsight, maybe gambling with flesh eating monsters wasn't the\r\n      brightest idea... (For legal reasons, we do not own the trademark to Mimic Dice\u2122.
