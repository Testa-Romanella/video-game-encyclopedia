The only remains of its existence are the once great bastions, now empty and in ruins. The only surviving boy and his mother live isolated in a small lake, inside a quiet valley. Once his mother dies, she leaves him a clue that mankind still survives in an enchanted city. Eden. This triggers the boy to take his ship and explore the luxurious world, in search of Eden.</p>\n\n<p>The game will follow the main narrative in a mostly linear progression. The player will move through the game using a flying boat. It will use air currents to travel in-between bastions, which are structures of the old world. Arriving in each bastion, the character will anchor the boat and step on land. Here the game will assume a standard 3rd person-view control of the character with jump, run, walk usual movement. At the end of each bastion, the story will progress.</p>\n<p>This game is still in development.</p>\r\nTeam:\r\n<ul><li>Afonso Ormonde - Programming</li><li>Andr\u00e9 Antunes - Narrative, Programming</li><li>B\u00e1rbara Marcial - 3D Art</li><li>Evandro Sequeira - 3D Art</li><li>Jo\u00e3o Lopes - 3D Art</li><li>Jo\u00e3o Patr\u00edcio - Programming</li><li>J\u00falia Pinheiro - Concept Art</li><li>Manuel Guimar\u00e3es - Programming</li><li>Manuel Menezes - Concept Art, 3D Art</li><li>Patr\u00edcia Henriques - 3D Art</li><li>Paulo Cardoso - Programming</li><li>Pedro Godinho - Programming</li><li>Renata Candeias - Concept Art</li><li>Sofia Ribeiro - Concept Art</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T13:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a7/3a75b88f6d7d3d25a505c75a8f697b0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antunes10"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
