It sure has been a while since I last uploaded one.</p>\n<p>I simply HAD to join Fairlii's Gelli Jam.\u00a0I love these little critters as much as he does, and it was great that I could craft a story and a game out of them!</p>\n<p>Most of the info is in the game, so I'll end it here. Download (or run the web version), play, and have fun!</p><p>By the way, there's an error in the help menu: Shift/L is used for FOCUSED MOVEMENT, or to move slower. My bad!
