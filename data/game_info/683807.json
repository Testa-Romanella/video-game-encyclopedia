Make sure to kill them as fast as you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In 2nd and 3rd wave, you'll encounter a different type of monster - \"HEALER\". The healer doesn't deal damage to you but instead it \"RESET\"s the health of all enemies continuously. In short, enemies won't die if there is a healer alive. Find the healer and kill it first.</p>\n<p>I'll guide you through some basic gameplay abilities and controls.</p>\n<p>Use \"LEFT\" mouse button to launch a basic attack combo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use \"Q\" key for your first skill - \"DASH\" (1 enemy hit to reset). Dash will charge you through the space, granting invulnerability during the dash. Use this skill to avoid enemy attacks.</p>\n<p>Use \"E\" key for your second skill - \"WOLF CHARGE\" (5 enemy hits to reset). Summon a wolf to reach out for enemies in a straight line. Press the E key and adjust the direction accordingly. On launching this attack, you will be launched in the air for a brief amount of time.</p>\n<p>Use \"X\" key for your ultimate skill - \"WOLF AURA\" (15 enemy hits to reset). Summon 4 arcane wolves that protect you from the monsters. This will immediately \"RESET\" all your skill cooldowns. While this skill is active, you can spam all your skills as much you wish. This aura lasts for 20 seconds. Enemies who are inside this aura will take huge amounts of burst damage.</p>\n<p>There is a boss, that you cannot attack till the first 3 waves. The boss will keep throwing boulders at you, try to dodge them - or you'll take huge amount of damage and the game will\u00a0\"RESET\".</p>\n<p>Boss has three skills -\u00a0</p>\n<p>1 - \"BOULDER THROW\" - Boss throws a huge detonating rock towards you, which deals a lot of damage. Try to dodge this skill with your \"DASH\"</p>\n<p>2 - \"GROUND SMASH\" - Boss gathers arcane powers and smashes the ground - dealing insane amounts of damage. Pro tip - Jump at the right time to avoid getting hit by this ability.</p>\n<p>3 - \"ENRAGE\" - This is the boss's ultimate ability. The boss enters the enrage state after 45 seconds. This will increase the boss's damage and damage reduction. Try to kill it before it enrages!</p>\n<p>This is it. Remember - your health resets after every wave. Make sure to use it as an advantage.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T06:08:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00c2017467d916070bb70a609fff776b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ishtmeet"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
