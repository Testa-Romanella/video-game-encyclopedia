This time I made myself all the game art. Im not an artist, it's know, but it gives it a special touch that I love.</p>\n<p>Its a clicker style game, made as part of the required games on a course that I'm taking. I'm uploading here just a few that I gived a little more than was necesary to expose them as a capabilities proof and a progress record.</p>\n<p>If you find it hard to beat, try equiping the ring that incrementes the reward, only on the two first encounters on each floor. That breaks the game a little, but it helps!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T14:33:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e98/e9831480f3da8eb09a6abc70255a7f07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adrian.giner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
