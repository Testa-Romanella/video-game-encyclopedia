It's a hardcore game without graphic with cool sound and ten-finger controlling.</p>\n<p>Hi everyone!<br/>Since I am old and very like vintage devices and games, I was inspired by the classic game The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, launched on <strong>Commodore 64</strong>. But I always lacked sound - all events took place in silence and I wanted to fill that void.\u00a0 Well, since it turned out that I am, in fact, a game sound producer, I decided to add sound. Somehow the idea of the <strong>\"</strong><strong>Framework\"</strong> was born.</p>\n<p><strong>This is just a one-level demo.</strong><strong> The project is under active development.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Warning!<br/></strong>If you want to enjoy this game, please use your headphones!</p>\n<p>The game currently supports two languages: <strong>RU </strong>(great mighty Russian) and <strong>EN </strong>(with strong russian accent). <em>Perfect <strong>EN </strong>will appear in the next update.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T06:46:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/717/717e10c7b9b17291dd25cac25ed4deec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["zreimbach"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
