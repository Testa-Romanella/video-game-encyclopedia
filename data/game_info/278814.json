{"id": 278814, "slug": "samuraiduel", "name": "SamuraiDuel", "name_original": "SamuraiDuel", "description": "<p>A simple fast-paced fighting game. All you can do is move, jump and attack. This game is inspired by a fantastic game called\u00a0<strong>Nidhogg</strong>.</p>\n<p>You are the samurai hiding in the woods. Several villages are afraid of your mastery and skills. They sent 100 of their best samurai to the woods with the purpose of killing you. Now, you have to survive and hold your position.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left and Right Keys to Move.</p>\n<p>Space Key to Jump.</p>\n<p>Left Control Key to Attack.</p>\n<p>You can change it in the game dialog, inside the Input tag. 'Horizontal (+)', 'Horizontal (-)', 'Jump' and 'Fire1' are the only controls that you need to modify.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Talk:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for Extra Credits's 2nd Game Jam. The theme was 'Present'. My interpretation of the theme was to compare my development skills: A comparison between my Past and my <strong>Present</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>PAST</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Here is the link to my\u00a0past and abandoned SamuraiDuel.</p>\n<p>Also, did I mention that the game is fast-paced and have slow-mo effects in it? Well, now I did.</p>\n<p>I want a lot more features but the Game Jam didn't allow me to do so. But I will be updating it later on. The game have some bugs and sometimes, the sword just go through the enemy without killing him. With that being said, 100 kills are possible.</p>\n<p>All the assets are made during the game jam period except the title text image that I picked from my old and abandoned SamuraiDuel project. I did it as to show that I completed my previous project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/896/8966590f476fc09bc58cb8140aa3efe7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Programmer Cheema"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
