I made it\u00a0using the Ink game engine (click the thing at the top of the game that says 'written in ink' to look at the way it works!)</p>\n<p>I've been using Twine to make text adventures for a long time but I think I kind of prefer Ink now! It's a lot faster to use, because it has a similar structure to Twine, in that you can navigate to\u00a0 different nodes by clicking links, but you can edit all of the story in one continuous file, with a clearer, easier to read syntax.\u00a0</p><p>I remember getting frustrated with Twine because of how tedious it was to open and close individual nodes over and over, how difficult it was to find anything and how messy and sprawling the code becomes once you have to start using plugins. While I think Twine is an excellent introduction to text adventures for beginner programmers, because of how easy the interface is to understand in the first instance, Ink seems a lot smoother in terms of complex workflow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e6c76e9576d1a7773fece8a22a27ed6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["piratescarfy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
