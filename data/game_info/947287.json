It only has 3 short levels, because I just wanted to move from c# to gdscript and wanted to finish something. Also I know the characters' and platforms' pixels are 25% bigger than the tileset's, but it makes things pop more.</p>\n<p>The first run should be around 4 to7 minutes long.</p>\n<p>Also spoilers: You don't see the friend at the end.</p>\n<p>Art software: Piskel, Engine: Godot, Sound software: Bosca Ceoil</p>\n<p>I don't know why but there seems to be a crash on windows after finishing level 2, which only happens if the game is ran from a shortcut with a different name as the executable, so if you are running it from a shortcut, name it the same as the .exe file (including the .exe).</p>\n<p>Also due to the natural wackiness of all web exports in any game engine,\u00a0clouds are stretched at some locations and particles are missing in the web version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T09:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/494/49413473af0dda8ea9e710a06e64eb3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Robot_With_A_Hat_Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
