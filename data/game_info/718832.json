They made a device that can displace an item from time and space. In doing so they accidentally brought a strange organism with it into their world. It causes death, then they reawaken and attack the living!</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>Has roughly 30 guns with more to come. There are 7 power ups that zombies can drop. A random gun giver I call the Weapon Displacer. A gun upgrade machine I call the Particle Accelerator Machine or P.A.M. for short. There are 8 perks so far but only 6 are on the map as the others haven't been put in yet. There is also a teleporter which requires three prisms to use. They are scattered around map and have a random designated spawn point every game.</p>\r\nSide Note\r\n<p>Still has some bugs but nothing too serious. Any graphical abnormalities that may occur are due to the way HTML draws the screen. Hope you enjoy my game that is still in development. No main menu as of now but hope to have done by end of the month. Also guns will get a heavy dose of damage and ammo rework in days to come. Ignore the random number on pause screen, it's used for testing and forgot to remove it.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>AWSD:\u00a0</strong>Move around</p>\n<p><strong>E:\u00a0</strong>Interact<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Equip Grenade</p>\n<p><strong>R:</strong> Reload</p>\n<p><strong>LMB:</strong> Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>RMB: </strong>Run</p>\n<p><strong>MMB/C Key:</strong>\u00a0Use Knife</p>\n<p><strong>ENTER:</strong> Pause the game</p>\n<p><strong>O:</strong> Zoom Out</p>\n<p><strong>P:</strong> Zoom In</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T06:31:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a438bb7e56453abe6123f0e7fb54b3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["3ternalFl4re"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
