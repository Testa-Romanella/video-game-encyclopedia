Depending on the route the player takes, combat dynamics change, and may demand new strategies.<br/></p>\n<p>There are three routes in the demo:</p>\n<ul><li>Normal Route</li><li>Solo Route</li><li>Alternate Route</li></ul>\n<p>The solo and alternate routes may require a new game, depending on the player's post-tutorial resources. Difficulty may be too high for those inexperienced with JRPG mechanics. Hints and cheese are options available for those that need them, but they won't provide the happy brain chemicals from finding a cool combination of attacks.<br/></p>\n<p>Solo project. Please no bully. I have feelings too you know.</p>\n<p>I would really appreciate a constant supply of ramen and a chance to make the game the best it can be. Please consider supporting development on Patreon.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T05:54:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb6bf0ac968712fb93647d0a824bf93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thistlebro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
