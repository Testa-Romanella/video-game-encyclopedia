The warden of a max security prison was violated by 3 inmates. Out of hundreds of these offenders, 20 are the most suspicious. The player needs to figure out which 3 of them were the offenders through a combination of 6 steamy mini-games. The mini-games include triage, turn based combat, and numeric puzzles. Wear them down with fights or sex sessions, then interrogate them. Beware of the prisoners trying to escape or start a riot. The core-game is a detective puzzle, use your logic to figure out the criminals through the information you have gathered. Every new game is completely randomized from offenders to hints to possible endings. Each play through is different. There are literally thousands of possible scenarios you may end up getting, and it is up to you to achieve hundreds of different ending combinations. In terms of adult content, this game features BDSM, ballbusting, dirty fighting, and sex between hyper-muscular men. Always fully nude, always outrageous and in-your-face.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-28T11:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/400/400d03a98bc2eefeae92edebf955f568.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Dodo"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aaron Dodo"], "esrb_rating": null}
