We had originally planned \r\nto have several crowd control mechanics and a better arena, but as so \r\nmany things in life often do, it just devolved into robots blowing each \r\nother up.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> - Movement</li><li><strong>Mouse</strong> - Aim/Turn</li><li><strong>Shift</strong> - Block</li><li><strong>Shift &amp; WASD</strong> - Dodge Roll</li><li><strong>Left Click</strong> - Fire</li><li><strong>Right Click</strong> - Special/Stronger Fire</li><li><strong>E</strong> - Throw weapon</li><li><strong>R</strong> - Respawn</li></ul>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>It\u2019s\r\n you against an army of power hungry robots. With limited power reserves\r\n available, you must punch reactors to take them and maintain control \r\nover them to siphon off all the power for yourself! Use stronger attacks\r\n to deal more damage at the expense of more of your energy, but be \r\ncareful. Expend it all and you die. You <strong>WILL need to block and dodge</strong> against weapon-wielding bots, so learn to love that Shift button!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/8318f62542804bb9ce10c329d1e6ca62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["schwingbat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
