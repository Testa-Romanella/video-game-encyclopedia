The project\u00a0was made for\u00a0Mini Jam 89\u00a0as a learning experience.</p>\n\n<p>The game's idea comes from the Chinese legend of Wu Gang (\u5433\u525b\u4f10\u6842) but instead of cutting a tree and being a human, Wu Gang is an astral being that travels the moon's whereabouts and\u00a0uses its speed to cut through pumpkins. Doesn't sound too fun, right?</p>\n\n\n<p>The game contains two game modes: an endless singleplayer and a local 2-player multiplayer. It's stylized a bit like retro games but with a few modern touches.</p>\n\n<p>Well, that's it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T04:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86c/86c602e090cadeea767ff9e833e533e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hadelek"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
