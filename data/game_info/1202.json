Race through hundreds of increasingly difficult levels, with new mechanics like fire, ice and jump portals. Each level has a split-second of opportunity for passage through the hordes of unrelenting enemies; either approach the obstacles through trial and error or pause to mentally traverse the level and plan for an optimal route. Try to top the leaderboards while listening to slick retro-inspired music while conquering a myriad of addicting challenges.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T16:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/652/652ca28151780115b3b46fe45322d990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 107, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Reverb Publishing"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Reverb Triple XP"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
