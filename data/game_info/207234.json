We come to you in an extreme matter, Earth is invaded as we speak by aliens. Very technologically advanced aliens, capable of ship shapeshifting and impervious to damage except to their own atoms.</p><p>Fortunately we managed to capture a ship and stole the technology. We built our own ship capable of shapeshifting and destroying the aliens. The catch is you have to be in the right shape to shoot the right bullets.</p><p>We lost all our experienced pilots in the initial attack near Mars and now we have to recruit gamers in order to fight the aliens. Our top scientists built a top of the art remote control simulator that allows you to control the ship from Earth. </p><p><strong>So what are you waiting for cadet?</strong></p><p>This game was built for Ludum Dare #35. Depending on our feedback we might continue improving it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/039/0392bd431ade48f1b1349a40e0fe1887.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["afruth"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
