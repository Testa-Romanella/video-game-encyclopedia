This is a simple game from BeFour Studio with a single, simple objective - complete one quick time event. However, you have a window of only a single frame to succeed. Are you fast enough?</p>\n<p>This is a single player game that can take anywhere from 4 - 30 minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>This game features multiple endings depending on how many times you fail the objective. You don\u2019t have an unlimited number of tries, but don\u2019t be too disheartened if it takes a few attempts. The narrator is kind of a jerk, don\u2019t let him get you down.</p>\n<p>Epilepsy Warning: This game contains flashing lights on the victory screen. There is epilepsy friendly mode available as well.</p>\n<p>This game was made in GameMaker Studio 2 by a team of four people, whose last name all started with the letter B, hence the name BeFour Studio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbd546a185870749674b8413b336917b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BeFour Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
