Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as Syzygy Engineering, it was the first arcade video game as well as the first commercially available video game. Computer Space is a derivative of the 1962 computer game Spacewar!, possibly the first video game to spread to multiple computer installations. It features a rocket, controlled by the player, engaged in a missile battle with a pair of flying saucers set against a background starfield. The goal is to score more hits than the enemy spaceships within a set time period, which awards a free round of gameplay. The game is enclosed in a custom fiberglass cabinet in one of four colors, which Bushnell designed himself to be futuristic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1971-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T11:26:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c56/c560e28ed7d30c8aa8d8221dab1b9a0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.92, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Syzygy Engineering"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Nutting Associates"], "esrb_rating": null}
