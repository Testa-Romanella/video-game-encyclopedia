And if it doesn't sound exciting enough already:\r\nIt's main, and only, game mechanic is a quick time event where you push buttons as fast as you can or you'll lose! Fun Fun Fun!\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>You only need (and can use really...) \r\n<strong>Arrow keys</strong> or<strong> W\u00a0/ A / S /</strong><strong> D</strong>\n<strong><em><br/>OR</em></strong> <em>(for the really cool people) </em><strong>D-Pad of your controller.</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Small personal note:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First time going solo in Ludum Dare!\u00a0</strong>Not my first game jam, as I was the artist on my past game jam entries. Learnt how to use Godot and GDScript and now I'm here! <br/></p>\n<p>This jam was a successful one, in my opinion. It really was fun and because I planned everything correctly: No crunch was needed! I think I can be proud of this game, even if it is a little bit funky and weird.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Music used:</p>\n<p>\"Sexy Time\" (CC0)<br/>by Komiku<br/>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Komiku</p>\n<p>\"Faster Does It\" (CC BY 3.0)<br/>by Kevin MacLeod<br/>http://incompetech.com</p>\n<p>\"In Shadows\" (CC BY 4.0)<br/>by William Ross Chernoff's Nomads<br/>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/William_Ross<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:50:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/961/961787ad705970c6fa62ffdb7dc02390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Katsuhira"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
