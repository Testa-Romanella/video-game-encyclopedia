If there is any issues/bugs please let me know in the comments below!</p>\n\n<strong>Change log</strong>Version 0.2.0:<br/>* Changed level 06 so it can be completed without having to follow an exact path/solution.<br/>* Increased the animation speeds on the 2D/fire character.<br/>* Added grounded directional movement to the 2D/fire character. Now you can move while on the ground!<br/>* Added zooming in and out using the mouse wheel for the 3D/ice character.<br/>* Increased the FOV for the 3D/ice character.<br/>* Changed how the camera works for the 3D/ice character. Now it uses 3D physics so that camera does not clip through the environment.<br/>* Increased the camera FOV for the 3D/ice character.<br/>* Added configurable controls, which can be changed in game from the title screen.<br/>* Changed some of the in game text to reflect recent changes.<br/>* Removed some of the default input bindings. Unfortunately I had to do this to make reconfigurable controls.<br/>* Updated the project to use Godot 3.0.4<br/>Version 0.1.1:<br/>* Changed the controls for restarting the level. Previously it was\r\nF and Control, now it is Backspace and Delete.\r\n<br/>* Removed the ability to increase gravity for the fire character\r\nwhen pushing down using WASD or arrow keys. May add this back later,\r\nbut I think it was causing a bug and it was a unused feature and unmentioned,\r\nso I removed it<br/>* Fixed various typos for the labels in both the fire dimension\r\nand the ice dimension<br/>* Changed the labels text to reflect the changes in controls, also added\r\na note about jumping by pushing the up arrow or the W key\r\n(Not a new feature, I just forgot to mention it in game)<br/>* Resized all of the labels in the fire dimension (2D) to they all have the\r\nsame sizing.<br/>* Moved some of the labels so they are easier to read.<br/>* Redid the crystal position track in level 4.1 (the 'secret' level), which\r\nwill hopefully fix the game freezing bug.<br/>* Slowed the animation in level 4.1 down a bit, so it is slightly easier to get\r\nthrough<br/>* Removed all of the shadows from the directional lights in all of the 3D levels.\r\nThey were not being used (due to the viewport having a shadow atlas size of zero)\r\nand when I fixed it they did not look good. I may add this later, but I do not \r\nhave the time to tweak them right now, and adding shadows would probably break the\r\nrules while the voting period is going on.<br/>Version 0.1.0:<br/>* Initial release!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/304/304f99b098b21a7c25e92edb628eb7de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TwistedTwigleg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
