This game was originally designed to be a mobile game meant to go on the apple store, but never got around to it so i'm putting it here instead.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game is somewhat like pong, it consists of taking a ball and bouncing it off of 2 blocks as much as you can, if you hit both blocks an equal amount of times, you end up with double the points, where as you don't hit them an equal amount of times you only get the one with the higher hits. You have two minutes to get a high of a score as possible</p><p>(Only Desktop Version availible as of rn)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/969e7240ce5076d92e0a929e228d1fd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kholstein"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
