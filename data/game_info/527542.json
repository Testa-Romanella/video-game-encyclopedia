And the sleek interactive design with chat window choices and occasional visual asides sets just the right tone to deliver the mood and message of the narrative.\"</em></li><li><em>\"This honestly feels like what all the tiny, evocative Twine games aspire to be and it does it so well. For such a small game, it has a lot of visuals but they are so effectively woven into the passages, it isn\u2019t distracting it all. Great atmosphere, so much care taken with each passage, and really cute and heartwarming ending. Never had Congee, but now I want to try it! Please play!\"</em></li><li><em>\"I absolutely loved this game. I felt the story so much. And the characters were so wonderfully written. The audio and graphics were excellent. I don't know what to say beyond that this game was amazing and I 100% recommend it.\"</em></li><li><em>\"Visually, the game is gorgeous, with animated line drawings, animated color scenes, and beautiful faux text messages.\"</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T03:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1bb2169f393a15eae8ae90f1807cb46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rebecca Chui"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
