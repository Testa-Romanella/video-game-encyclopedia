{"id": 427218, "slug": "arcamus", "name": "Arcamus", "name_original": "Arcamus", "description": "<p>Based on the Atari 2600 game, Adventure. This took advantage of better collision detection which I learned. It also has an \u201cengine\u201d of sorts, and signifies my attempt to streamline my coding. Every room is built using the same building blocks (6 or so cubes of colour), each governed by the same code, just with different location variables. Some rooms also have items in them, and the enemies are identical, with no AI. I was also experimenting with detection of computer speeds, since inputing numbers is a pain \u2013 but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t quite work. I highly recommend you play this, but you\u2019ll need to experiment until you find a speed where the monsters are fast enough to catch you if you try to run past them, but slow enough to allow you to run back in the direction you came (about 30'000 on my Win7 laptop). Like Adventure, there\u2019s also an Easter Egg. If you kill all the enemies, then grab an invisible item in a tiny walled off room, and then take it and drop it in a big empty grey room, you\u2019ll be able to grab the glowing circle and discover something totally awesome. And by awesome, I mean pointless.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:41:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b4/8b47a065dd956fdbd12459b72a5adb0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SZCZ GAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
