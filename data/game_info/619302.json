The theme was \"Joined together\". <br/></p>\n<p>Play as a prisoner breaking out of jail. The catch is, you can't jump, and you're chained to a big iron ball. That said, you are tremendously strong, and can toss/throw/yeet the iron ball quite far. If thrown hard and precise enough you might gain enough speed and agility to break out! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: Move around with WASD or arrow keys. Left click and drag the player or the iron ball with your mouse to \"charge up\" a toss. Release to fly off! ESC to bring up a menu. Best played with a mouse and keyboard (i.e. no trackpad) for best results. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to install: </strong>Either play in browser, or if you use windows you can 1. download the windows build.zip, 2. unzip the contents into a folder, 3. run the .exe<br/></p>\n<p>All code and \"art\" made by me using Unity during the 48hr time window of the jam. <br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:13:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/762/762e5d148f928991a13bd6df765c25fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["wesslo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
