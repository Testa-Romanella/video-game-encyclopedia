At the same time, new concepts such as Sprites have been added to enrich the game, and the details have also been repeatedly polished and improved.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn terms of planting, we have improved the problem of insufficient guidance at the beginning that was raised a lot in the previous work. Appropriately provide planting methods, while reducing the difficulty, retain the fun of players' own exploration. In addition, pest control and weed control are enriched. The task system has also been newly added, and there will be new tasks waiting for you to challenge in each stage!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn terms of new content, you are likely to meet some new friends. You can sell the eggplant to NPC Momo, or you can learn a mysterious story from the sprites. And the exploration of this part of the content is also inseparable from your planting ability.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOh, in this work, a mechanism that the game will fail when the plant dies is removed, so that you have more space to explore, and you will meet sprites as soon as possible.
