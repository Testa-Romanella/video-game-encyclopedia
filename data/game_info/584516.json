Welcome to Project: Catalyst, an experiment in which you will help me combine these unstable elements into a compound. My tether gun (left-click) can connect these elements, and once you connect them in the recipes specified by the list on the right, we will move onto our next set! If you mess up, you can right-click your mouse to shoot an anti-tether to disconnect all tethers from the element hit by the end of the tether gun.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get hit, and good luck out there!</p>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<p>- The background music will play twice over itself if you hit \"Retry\" on the first level after dying. To fix this, simply return to the menu and hit play again.</p>\n<p>- In longer games, enemies will congregate in the bottom right corner until you approach them.</p>\n<p>- Lighting in the web build didn't come out quite right.<br/></p>\n<p>- Pressing 'Quit' on the menu that appears either when you die or complete a level\u00a0makes you restart the game. The pause menu 'Quit' button will send you to the menu, however.</p>Credits<p><em>John Manard III</em> - Programmer and game designer</p><p><em>Fiona Soetrisno</em> - Programmer, artist, and game designer</p><p><em>Lauren Nakamura</em> - 3D and 2D artist\u00a0and\u00a0game designer</p><p><em>Megan Belle Maun</em> - 2D artist and\u00a0game designer</p><p><em>worblir </em>- Programmer and game designer</p><p><strong>Music</strong></p><p>The main menu song used was an edited version of 'Too Cool' by Kevin MacLeod (Music Source)</p><p>Too Cool Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>The main song during gameplay\u00a0used was 'Funky Chunk' by Kevin MacLeod (Music Source)</p><p>Funky Chunk Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p><strong>Audio</strong><br/></p><p>Most audio/sound effects are from Adobe Audition's sound effect library\u00a0(Link)</p>\n<p>Failure buzzer sound effect by hypocore\u00a0(freesound.org link)</p><p><strong>Extra Environment 3D Models</strong><br/></p><p>Some additional environment 3D models used were made\u00a0by Google's 'Poly by Google' user account on Google Poly.
