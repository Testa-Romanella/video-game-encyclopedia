{"id": 949295, "slug": "beneath-the-shadow", "name": "Beneath The Shadow", "name_original": "Beneath The Shadow", "description": "<p>\"Beneath The Shadow\" is a\u00a0 horror game where you must navigate through a dimly-lit cave system filled with perilous obstacles. As you explore the depths of the cavern, you will uncover clues and explore the area, that will lead you closer to the truth about what happened to the previous explorers who ventured into the cave before you. But be warned, danger lurks around every corner and one wrong move could spell your demise. Will you be brave enough to face the what await in the darkness, or will you succumb to the terrors of your imagination? The project was made under 1 week. I want to thank everyone, who participated and a big shout out to my long time followers. Hope you enjoy this short experience.
