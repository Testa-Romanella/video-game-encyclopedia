Persuaded (but you don't know well why), you accept the request to jump inside the scary portal in front of your eyes. The travel makes you unconscious. When you wake up, you find yourself in Cubicus, a world made of cubes and, in front of you, a scientist-looking cubeman is talking by himself about his own discoveries. When you ask him to explain better the story, he just hurries you up to find the blue gems telling that there's no time to waste. What happened to Cubicus? Will you be able to know the secrets of this arcane world?<br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/>Cubicus Arcanum is a 3D indie puzzle game where, as told in the intro, the main goal is to collect the blue gems that allow you to unlock the doors and get out from the dungeons. But it isn't always as simple as it seems because the dungeons are scattered of traps, hazards and dangerous inanimate... <strong>cubes</strong>! The game is subdivided into 10 different stages. In each stage there are some mechanics (expressly made to complicate your life), items to collect that will help you along the path, secrets to discover and a monstrous boss waiting you at the end of each one.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>250 total levels</strong><br/><ul><li> 200 normal levels<br/></li><li> 10 bosses<br/></li><li> 20 hidden levels<br/></li><li> 20 riddler's levels</li></ul></li></ul><br/><ul><li> <strong>Inventory</strong><br/><ul><li> 14 collectable items - such as shields, bombs, treasure maps, story piece (that will unveil the mystery) and many more</li></ul></li></ul><br/><ul><li> <strong>Customizable Player</strong><br/><ul><li> The main character is customizable using the currency and the skins you find in the game (no need to use real money!)</li></ul></li></ul><br/><ul><li> <strong>22 Tutorials</strong> (easy and almost textless)</li></ul><br/><ul><li> <strong>Trophies</strong><br/><ul><li> 26 in-game unlockable trophies, based on your performances</li></ul></li></ul><br/><ul><li> <strong>Hearts Mini-game</strong><br/><ul><li> In Cubicus Arcanum is easy to die or to get stuck.
