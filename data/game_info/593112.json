A 3D racer inspired by Powerdrift, Stunt Car Racer, Hard Drivin'.</p>\n<p>Choose from 8 varied race tracks, and overtake the other drivers in 5 laps to win. As well as racing you'll need to navigate jumps, roller-coaster like ramps and occasionally even drive upside down.\r\n</p>\n<p>Includes 3 difficulty levels, plus a practice mode for getting the feel of the track.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This is a complete HTML5 port of the original PICO-8 version</em><em>. It supports higher resolution and gamepad and touch screen controls, but is otherwise exactly the same game.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow keys = Steer and accelerate/brake</p>\n<p>Z/X = Alternative accelerate/brake (PICO-8 style!)</p>\n<p>P = Pause menu (when racing)</p>\n<p>Alt+Enter = Toggle full screen mode</p>\n<p>Or plug in a game controller. Currently works with XBox 360 controllers and those with similar layouts.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobile controls</strong></p>\r\n\u00a0Touch the icon to steer and slide left/right the amount to turn by. Release to recenter.<br/>\r\n Press to brake.\r\n<p>Press to accelerate.</p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>You don't have to wait to be automatically respawned after you fall of the track, select \"Respawn\" in the pause menu to get back into the race faster.<br/></p>\n<p>The green and red lines on the speedometer are recommended\u00a0<em>minimum</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>maximum</em>\u00a0speeds. The green line (minimum speed) is particularly important for clearing jumps (and occasionally getting up steep hills), so make sure to keep your speed above it. The red line (maximum speed) is to prevent you from sliding out on sharp corners or overshooting the jumps. Typically this is just a suggested speed - depending on your racing line, driving style etc you may be able to go faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T12:28:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fae/fae334f473a64d251f0cbe12f6effe6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tom Mulgrew"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
