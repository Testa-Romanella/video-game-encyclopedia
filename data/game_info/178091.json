The death of paper. Crumple is about <strong>Enve</strong>: An envelope brought to life, who wakes up inside a paper factory that is burning to the ground. </p><p>Enve will have limitations from the normal type of platforming character. One of those limitations: A lack of arms. With Enve not having arms, it'll need to rely on some risky physics to get around within its world. </p><p>You, the player, will also use Enve's small variety of moves in order to resolve the many environmental puzzles within a period of time. These will include slides, double jumps, &amp; yes, <strong>crumpling</strong>!</p><p>Can you help Enve escape the mysterious fire within the factory, all the while leaving the player to discover how Enve ended up where it is and why? Time is against you... </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4a02e6f1ba7f6cb0c6cd0d78186f461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NascentGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
