Click the white square button to make your Monky flap and avoid the obstacles! Can you reach the highest hiscores of them all?\u00a0</p>\n<p>On PC use either mouse click or space to flap :)</p>\n<p>This is my first game ever (yes i followed a tutorial) so i am very excited that everything (hopefully) works. This is a very very VERY super extra early prototype. In the future, once i'm better at programming, i might add more stuff like leaderboard, collectable coins, different Monky's, etc. But for now, i'll go and study so i can make better games without following any tutorials. Thank you for reading and downloading (if you did) :)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Funee Monkee, lovbl i luv funee monkee.</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T16:56:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2687f9a9fb62c2b99acc1f3018da27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["MancerGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
