Something hit your spaceship, controls and reactor got unstable. Aliens appeared because of radiation and they will be staying in dark rooms. You have to control the ship with the yoke and keep reactor in the stable status, otherwise you will get off course or get blown up.</p>\r\nTutorial:\r\n<ul><li>A, D - Move</li><li>Space - Jump</li><li>R - Use door</li><li>E - Use yoke / Pickup item</li><li>LMB - Shoot</li><li>Q - Drop item</li><li>ESC - Pause</li></ul>\n\n<p>Your weapons can get overheated, the bar at the bottom of the screen is showing overheating progress. You can cool your weapons in the extremely small square rooms once you close both doors, the blue cooling effect will appear.</p>\n<p>You can heal yourself near reactor.</p>\n<p>In order to not blow up the reactor will ask for certain items that are located on your ship in different rooms, you have to bring this item to it. When you pickup an item for reactor you will get an unstable weapon. Some doors maybe closed, so you will have to pickup keys.</p>\n<p>To keep your ship on course you have to go back to cockpit and press E near yoke (control center). Once you reach 0 degrees it will stay on course for some random time then it will slowly start drifting away. The longer ship turns away the faster it will get. If you reach 180 degrees spin the game will end since you got off course.</p>\n<p>The game will end once you survive for the certain amount of time, you will reach your destination, closest planet to make an emergency landing.</p>\r\nRate Game\r\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/unstable-235<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c0919da75bc1d2813848edd4ad9e1bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GeoBlackrU"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
