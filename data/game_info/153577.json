After that, a team was created to develop the game, a programmer, 2D artist, sound designer, animator and game designer formed the development team.</p>\n<p>In \u00a0March of 2016, we created a group for playtesters try our game.</p>\n<p>Link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/playtesting.trigave/</p>\n<p>On the first Monday of every month, we sent a build for our developers to test the current state of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We also created a character account to give the players a way to see what the world is about.</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/AteginaLusis</p>\n<p>Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/trigave</p>\n<p>On October of 2016 I decided to halt the development of the game due to two major problems:</p>\n<p>- We over scoped the game, which means it would take a long time to finish it on the current skill of the team.</p>\n<p>- We also had a lot of fights about how the game should be developed.\u00a0</p>\r\n-&gt; Special Thanks\r\n<p>- Henrique P\u00f3voa, \u00a0programmer</p>\n<p>- Jo\u00e3o Vento, 2D artist</p>\n<p>- Manel Bello, animator</p>\n<p>- Jo\u00e3o Garcia, sound designer</p>\r\n-&gt; Personal Note\r\n<p>I was CRAZY during this game! Created so many unnecessary content, lore, characters, cities on a planet that wasn't going to be used in-game at all! Yet I loved making this game with the people that I did, awesome guys \ud83d\ude0a.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/189/1896eb077e4e63a938d7a1a4d2b9fd12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jerg33"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
