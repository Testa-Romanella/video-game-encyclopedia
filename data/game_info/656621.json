Collect items and throw them at civilians to startle them. Use the WASD keys to move. Watch out for the animal control. If you get too close they will catch you.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my game, I'm aware that there are a few glitches. So feel free to make suggestions. I plan on continuing the game once the game jam is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T23:37:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e7/5e70030945b49b60db98b72d833cacc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zues54"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
