The game was made over the course of six days!\r\nThe Jam's theme was \"there and back\" with the focus being \"collectables\" throughout the game it's about making it there to retrieve the collectables then making it back before you run out of time!\r\nUnfortunately due to time constraints &amp; having to submit this about 9 hours early due to personal reasons I was unable to finish all the level's &amp; tie off the end of the story. There may be a potential future update post-jam once feedback is received so stay tuned!\r\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong><strong>ACTION</strong>W/A/S/D<br/>MOVESPACEJUMPSHIFTDASHESCAPEGO TO MENUALT+ENTERFULLSCREEN TOGGLERRESTART ROOM\r\nDOWNLOADS:\u00a0\r\n<strong>ZIP: Please extract the ZIP into a separate folder &amp; make sure all components are together as the game won't function properly. You may get a windows virus pop up also but don't worry it's not a virus :)</strong>\n<strong>INSTALLER:\u00a0The game will be installed as a program on your computer so there should be a executable created after the Game Maker installation process is finished! Deleting the folder or going to programmes &amp; features removes it when your done!</strong>\n<strong>YouTube: I also cover a range of other things over on my YouTubechannel! I'll be hoping to release a video on this jam in the next week or so. If you want to see that make sure to go check it out!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:18:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77e/77e9786b5538b15012f37a556d1d43c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GmGuru"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
