Taking inspiration from an adventure puzzle solver, Human Fall Flat, our main focus was to develop a game that follows the same funny physics-driven aspect but put it into an environment where the player has the freedom to manage a pub the way they want to. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls: PC | PS4 | Xbox<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Movement\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 - WASD | Left Analogue stick<br/>Rotate player\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 - QE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0| Right Analogue stick<br/>Jump \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Space\u00a0 \u00a0| X \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 | A<br/>Left Hand Grab \u00a0\u00a0 - LMB \u00a0 \u00a0 | L2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0| LT<br/>Right Hand Grab - RMB\u00a0 \u00a0 | R2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 | RT<br/>Pause\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 - Esc/P \u00a0 | Options\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 | Menu<br/></p>\n<p>(When Object Grabbed)<br/>Lift/Lower Object -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | Right Analogue stick up/down<br/>Rotate Object\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 | Right Analogue stick up/down<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Guide To Downloading:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Extract the zip file and select the \"Jobsworth\" file and play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb5/eb5c0843d5b25492c86bf0154444deb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikodem Hamrol"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
