And do not forget to sell him rabbits as it is the only way to get rid of some of these very dangerous little devils. Lastly you can buy ammos.<br/></p>\n<p>I told you that it was a simulation game !</p>\n<p>You'll need several tries to find the right settings for incomes and purchases.<br/></p>\n<p>You need to reach as soon as possible the 10 000$, game is ended if time is elapsed, or if more than 20 rabbits die, or if you get overwhelmed and reach the 1000 rabbits.</p>\n<p>A Score screen evaluates your perf, and gives you a rank.</p>\n<p>I've managed to reach the \"Legend\" rank only once !<br/></p>\n<p>I tried to make it feel a little like my old Game Watches LCDs, repetitive but hard to beat, with fixed screen and not lots of models.</p>\n<p>Do not forget that this is just my take on the course's theme that was \"state machines\".</p>\n<p>I won't explain to much of it here because it's hard for me to find the english words.</p>\n<p>There are tips on the menu screen that you can read by pressing repeatedly the keyboard arrows.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you will have some fun playing this.</p>\n<p>I'd appreciate some\u00a0 feedback to know if something is wrong, or just to say you had fun !</p>\n<p>Bye !<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T04:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c1/0c18215f2505427032a399a03bbe1ac5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lost In Code"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
