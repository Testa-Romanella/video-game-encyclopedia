We get together every week for a 8-hours jam to experiment on the new opportunities in educational resources and collective intelligence.</p>\n<p>This time we wanted to work on CHOICES : how do we do them, what level of uncertainty we accept while making them and how we improve our strategies when facing consequences !</p>\n<p>We made this game in 2x \"8 hours Jams\" + a bit of extra time working on graph assets and writing scripted events. We hope you enjoy it !</p>\n<p>We're all from France so pleeeaaase forgive us for the bad english... and help us improve the events !<br/></p>\n<p>Made by  Delphin Casado, Lola El Koubi, Tom Rivi\u00e8re and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Urien.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T03:54:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd419792198d0c004d0c557b344b5755.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Savvy"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
