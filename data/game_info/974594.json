Strange noises can be heard outside so you decide to lock the doors and close the windows. On your way to the final window, you hear something rustling close by. Upon shutting the window, a monster rushed past your view, taking you by surprise. Minutes later you get a phone call from a number you have never seen been. You pick up the phone, hands shaking, and hear nothing but raspy breathing. It is the monster.\r\n\r\nQuick, Get to the saferoom by solving various puzzles throughout the house, all while dodging the monster that has decided to haunt you!\r\n\r\n*NOTE*\r\nThis is my first game as a 13 year old, so it isn't very refined and is a little buggy. I am working on a complete version with different levels, three more monsters, and many different puzzles,", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-05T05:32:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/1980545e4611917d61d5a1bb7840063a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Creaky Floorboard"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Creaky Floorboard"], "esrb_rating": null}
