At <strong>level master </strong>the <strong>AI</strong> is <strong>unbeatable</strong>.</p><p>You have also a <strong>Testing-mode</strong> where you can calculate optimal moves from all board positions or experiment a bit.</p><p>  This app is optimized for fast game play and <strong>low memory</strong> and<strong> low CPU usage</strong>. No hard brute force calculations. Behind works a new kind of AI. The AI plays aggressive and tries to create opportunities to win the game. You won't find no other implementation of Quarto or 2x2-Quarto that could compete with this AI in speed and playing strength (at master level). <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b76beb1ce4bc9129e7d24e4440612868.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DroidPlusPlus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
