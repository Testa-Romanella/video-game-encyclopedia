He also makes games and is an amazing guy</li><li>Rem who has helped with scenario writing and tonal planning!</li><li>Curly who did all of the music and sound effects, again a fantastic human being and you should check out his work!</li></ul>\n\n<p>eStudent is a student simulation game where your goal is... passing university?!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you've filled out your application form confirming a few details about yourself, you get dropped into your Room where your student will waltz around and get comfortable before engaging in a few encounters!</p>\n\n<p>Encounters are your primary way of interacting with eStudent!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You'll be given a scenario and four options as to what you can do, each option will be linked to a stat that you have and it's your decision as to what you wish to do!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your character will perform the action and if they succeed then that's great for you!\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, if they fail you'll lose some health, you'll have the option to retake it but it will cost you!</p>\n<p>Worried you're not going to make your successful move? Use some FATE to try and ensure success!\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are loads of different possibilities and scenarios in encounters, depending on where you are and what course you're doing you'll find your scenarios and options very different!</p>\n\n<p>Encounters aren't just for casual events, once you reach certain thresholds in your student's adventure you'll be able to take an assignment!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each course has 4 assignments and a dissertation to complete! Each course will use different skills so depending on what you've been training yourself in depends on how well you'll pass your assignments!</p>\n<p>If you pass your dissertation then you get to graduate as your student! Graduated students allow you to earn points to use to buy upgrades for new potential students!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In eStudent, you can start the game by accessing the bedroom and the lecture hall but we're also looking at adding a park soon! With more locations being considered including a shop!</p>\n\n<p>Students can also get skills! Skills are game-changing abilities that let your students acquire specific bonuses such as stat bonuses or even the ability to see hidden information!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>When a student graduates you'll be able to buy new items in the in-game shop</p>\n<p>You'll be able to buy new courses for your students to enrol in, new personalities for your students to have, and new clothes your student can buy in the shop or get in their daily free items!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game started off as an idea I had while walking to a friend's house back in early 2015, since then the game has gone through many iterations (Even being my dissertation) and I am still interested in this idea!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Truthfully though, I worry that I am indulging in an idea that only I'll enjoy and so I've decided to cut back and just put this game on Itch and Google Play under myself and see if people really want to and enjoy this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb3990f2d987b712507d6a833b70f6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alaneje"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
