Each level, pulled from the main game, has been fine-tuned to allow players to ease into the gameplay.\u00a0<br/><br/><em><strong>Gameplay</strong></em><br/><br/>As stated above,\u00a0<em>Jolt: Fully Charged\u00a0</em>is made in the image of 16-bit era platformers, and functions the way you would expect it to. Your goal is to reach the end of each level, defeat the boss, and continue onto the next stage.<br/><br/>Where things differ, however, is Jolt's ability to become intangible and phase through enemies with his signature Bolt Dash. Combined with his wall jump and double jump, the player has many different approaches to situations they'll encounter.<br/><br/>You collect various power ups, such as the Dash Shield, which gives you new abilities such as double-dash, item magnetism, or even the ability to glide. Explore and find them all!\u00a0(And\u00a0yes, all powerups are in the demo!)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Features and Coming Soon</strong></em></p>\n<p>Here is what is\u00a0coming in the launch of the main game:</p>\n<p> 10+ Large Levels, each with their own challenges.</p>\n<p> Fast-paced platforming with an emphasis on aerial control and momentum.<br/></p>\n<p> A\u00a0similar, but distinct, playstyle for all playable characters. (Yes, we said characters.)<br/></p>\n<p> Additional gameplay modes, including alternate story modes (complete with playable characters), and a time attack mode unlockable after completing the game!</p>\n<p>Jolt:\u00a0Fully Charged is slated to be released in September of 2018 (Next Month)!</p>\n<p>The main game itself is nearly completed.\u00a0But before we release the game, we want to know what\u00a0<em>you\u00a0</em>have to think about it. Are there things that need to be tweaked?\u00a0Gameplay quirks that need adjusting?\u00a0Or perhaps there's some nasty glitches that need stamping out before launch?\u00a0 We want to hear from you!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please, enjoy our demo!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bare Minimum Requirements:\u00a0</strong><br/><br/>Operating System: \u00a0Windows XP, 7, 10 (<em>Incompatible with Windows 8.1</em>)<br/><br/>Processor: Intel or AMD dual core 2.5GHz\u00a0<br/><br/>RAM: 2GB<br/><br/>Hard Drive Space: 1GB<br/><br/>Video Memory: 256 MB's\u00a0DDR2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4b/d4bdf4bf78d34ea38c2b2e2b2c5d33bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Darkera Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
