{"id": 891392, "slug": "song-of-mania", "name": "Song Of mania", "name_original": "Song Of mania", "description": "<p><em>Song of Mania</em> is a Story driven, point and click game. Its story is the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, a well known and often retold tragedy where Orpheus tries to get his wife Eurydice back from the underworld.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>However we at good question games want to take a different approach; for most often in this tragedy Eurydice is simply depicted as damsel in distress, with little to no agency. We want to tell her story, how she grapples with her own death, how it felt to lose her love, and how she reacts when Orpheus comes for her.</p>\n\r\nFeatuers\r\n<p>The gameplay is a demo where you play through the tutorial of the game, learning the controls and getting introduced to our main characters.</p>\n<p>Mechanics inlcued</p>\n<ul><li>Point and click puzzles</li><li>Item highlighting</li><li>Character interactions</li></ul>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Left click = move/interact</li><li>Right click = inspect</li><li>Space/mouse wheel pres = highlight objects</li></ul>\r\nDownload instruction\r\n<p>Simply Download the zip folder and extract on your computer.

Although Song of Mania is our exam taks we have put a lot of love into the project. Originally developed in unreal but due to personal limitations we changed over to Unity, making development time effectively 1 month of hard work.\r\n</p>\n<p>The future of the project is uncertain but we hope you enjoy this small piece that we have prepared for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T04:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1ebaa435d3c9c6c20ff3b6a5cc7f7b26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Good Question Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
