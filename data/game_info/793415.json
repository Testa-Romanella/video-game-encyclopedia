Play the whole game for the full experience. Design has been iterated upon slightly since video upload. </strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>By David Rollinson </strong>- submission for <strong>Fede Fasce</strong>'s class <strong>'Expressive Game Design'</strong> at <strong>Goldsmiths University.\u00a0<br/></strong></p><p><strong>CONTROLS: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT or W, A, S, D to move. Things you can interact with are in white. Exits and entrances are hidden, but will sometimes be marked. Explore and find your way around this </strong> short bitsy game about stillness. The first Bitsy game I've ever made so it's pretty clunky. I took heavy inspiration from 'The World Had Been Sad Since Tuesday' - a beautiful little game by Fred Bednarski, found here. Made for<strong> Bitsy Game Jam May 2022</strong> with the theme 'duck'.<br/></p>\n<p>I tried to use several different techniques during its making. I played with the world's sense of scale and orientation through rotating different tiles and placing walls in the way of direct paths from one exit to another. I also used Pixsy - an image-to-room tile generator for Bitsy, found here. In terms of gameplay, the techniques offered by Bitsy are fairly limited, but I tried to experiment a little with positive and negative reinforcement within gameplay - making the player have to explore more or pick up an item(s) before they can progress further. I also included two different endings depending upon the amount of items picked up along the way. You discover more about the stillness the more items picked up.</p>\n<p>The game's loose narrative tries to speak to the inertia that is sometimes felt nowadays with the foreclosure of possibility under capitalism. The desert often operates as an 'out-side' to this, as a place of political, social and material potential. In my artistic practice, I cover ideas proposed by Deleuze and Guattari around nomadology and the provocations that might arise out of a desert setting. The stillness of the desert could give rise to new sociopolitical realities. <br/></p>\n<p>For this game's music I used an old track that I threw together on Ableton.\u00a0You can find it on my SoundCloud here.<br/></p>\n<p>Synopsis:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>One day in the desert, the migrating of birds brings a stillness. You decide to follow a bird to learn where this stillness might end. Pick up items and discover more along the way.</strong> <strong>Will you subsume into the stillness or reject it? </strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T20:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83a/83ae1bc3fc4cf33259f424ac93f17b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["droll002"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
