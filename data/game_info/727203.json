The topics and posts the game includes will be unsettling or offensive for some.\u00a0 For those who are easily offended or not 4chan users I would recommend waiting for the SAFE MODE setting to be implemented, which will censor the more controversial posts featured in the game]</p>\n<p>Also:</p>\n<p>The game uses a lot of placeholder (free) art and some music that you will probably notice also has to be replaced.
