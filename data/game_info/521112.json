You may have played some games our members have worked on! We're a small community of independent game developers, and Glitch City is the shared community space\u00a0where we make games and run local events.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Due to Covid, we haven't been able to use our office since the start of the year. This has created financial difficulties and has made it challenging to maintain the spirit of our community -- so we did a game jam to try to address both problems.</p>\n<p>Our community\u00a0worked closely together for a handful of weekends and made 6 snappy bite-sized games. This is where you step in -- <strong>if you can, please help us keep the lights on. We hope you\u00a0enjoy our game bundle!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Additionally, 25% of proceeds will go to the LA Food Bank.</em></p>\n\r\nThe 6 games in this bundle\u00a0are...\r\n\n<p><strong>Biodome II:</strong> You, a feral human, have one braincell. Eventually you can have complex thoughts. You need to eat to survive, you need to poop when you eat, you need to kill the gremlin that escapes from your poop. The circle of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong> Jamie Parreno, Pen Ward, Ben Esposito, Beretta Lucifer</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>GOLDLINE:</strong> Visit a flashback day trip in this short walkabout experience around Chinatown. Take in the sights and sounds, maybe enjoy a boba tea or two.</p>\n<p><strong>Team:\u00a0</strong>xptnd, Brendon Chung</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>STARSTEALER:</strong>\u00a0The robots are trying to steal vital star energy. Your only recourse is to kill 'em all. Jetpack around space stations lousey with murderous bots, and use your patented Bouncy Bullets to sling chaos down upon their cold unfeeling hearts.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong>\u00a0Alex Belzer, Rachel Sala, Beau Blyth, Evan Hembacher</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Fire Train:</strong> Ride through the mountains listening to country radio and putting out as many binary fires as you can.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong>\u00a0Veena Vignale, ATL3Y, Rachel Sala, Beau Blyth, Nat Dee, Aquma, Linden Reid</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>MANBALL:</strong>\u00a0A ball of flesh has entered the stage, the hands of fate push you forwards. Does redemption await at the end, or does only MANBALL?</p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong> Russell Honor, Lena Huang</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p><strong>CHILL ZONE: ACT 1: ONLINE:</strong>\u00a0If ur looking for a chill spot to hang out with ur friends, this one is alright! We mostly have cubes these days. Admittedly thIngs can get out of hand. Our Cubes Division have been overwhelmed lately by the uncontrolled cube enlargement... Also you can sit on things, which we generally feel good about at this stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong>\u00a0Teddy Dief,\u00a0Tyler J Hutchison</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<br/>\n<p>We appreciate you taking the time to check out our <strong>Keep the Lights On</strong> bundle.
