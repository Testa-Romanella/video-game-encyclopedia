Unlike these games however, the art style is to be reminiscent of the early Pokemon games.</p>\n<p> The game is currently in development, however I do have a demo available to download for those wanting a little insight on what to expect. It contains the first part of the game.<br/></p>\n<p>The expected release date is sometime in 2018. I'm planning on having a few separate endings to the game all depending on choices made within the campaign. It'll hopefully be available for Windows, macOS and Linux and maybe even Android. I'll post more details when I'm closer to releasing.</p>\n<p>NB - Some sprites including main character sprites are simple placeholders.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Stuck on a puzzle?

It is a full speedrun of the Demo and has all the answers to how you proceed.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong> Windows XP - 10\u00a0// macOS 10.9 - 10.12 // 64bit Debian Linux.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>: Arrow keys - movement. Space - use. I - inventory. Q - back/esc/pause. The game autosaves whilst playing.<br/></p>\n<p>Placeholder Music - Eric Skiff.
