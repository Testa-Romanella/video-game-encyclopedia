I forgot to mention with the first project but both are works in progress and intended to be improved.\u00a0You are a character that is neither male or female.\u00a0 You wake up in a clearing in the middle of the forest, large white gate far behind you, with large white spires piercing through the treetops beyond.\u00a0 This is an extension of a previous text based game that I was working on in my programming class, also later worked on in a text-based format,\u00a0in which you are a fallen angel discovering who you are, and what memories you\u2019ve forgotten.\u00a0</p>\r\nGoals\r\n<ol><li><strong>Discover your character:</strong> Over the course of the game you can choose which paths to take, beasts to slay, and people to interact with.\u00a0 Depending on your decision at these times can allow the player to learn a piece of the character that they control in the game.</li><li><strong>Multiple playthroughs:</strong> No matter what you do during your journey in the game you will get to the same ending scene.\u00a0 At that end scene as well as after you will learn what happens to the character and who the character is.\u00a0 This is calculated by what you\u2019ve done prior to the end.  Allowing some to know more backstory than others.\u00a0</li><li>Distinct environments similar to the ones that were described of in the original game. \u00a0Showing off the environments, the characters, hero, and the decision making with each path.</li></ol>\r\nSpecifications\r\n<p>Allowing for options of multiple paths. Having an inventory of everything you\u2019ve collected along your way.\u00a0 Possibly a life bar. Triggering certain outcomes by what you\u2019ve previously collected.</p>\r\nHardships<p>In working with Bitsy there was a big adjustment to how the story would be presented. \u00a0Given that in the engine there could only be a max of three colors, some changes had to be made. \u00a0There was also the fact that since bitsy was a different experience all together, a player wouldn't have the same feel. \u00a0Hearing the characters thoughts in the text-based game, like a book, compared to a movie. \u00a0Trying to perform that same sense of immersion without hearing the characters thoughts during their excursion. \u00a0</p><p>One of the greatest advantages of this however was that by making the open world, it flooded myself with more and more ideas on how to further the journey for the character. \u00a0While some of the features in the game were never fully brought to life in the text-based game, it could be more interesting in Bitsy. \u00a0Having that interaction with another character and letting the player have more freedom to explore the world. \u00a0Nevertheless there is only so much time in a day and, just like the other game, might not have everything. \u00a0Mostly because of my personal problem of having detail in the drawing in the game, but also the route. \u00a0Finding a way to mimic the hidden passages, grabbing the particular items are different. \u00a0This is because of the lack of programming for the game and it's simplicity.</p>Milestones<p>Some challenges for the player</p><ol><li>Talk to a priest</li><li>Fight a wolf</li><li>Leave flowers at a grave</li><li>Choose paths</li><li>Fight Boss</li><li>Grab Angel</li><li>Talk to the traveler</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:38:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e58/e58b3c0110f1d909df678db13fb2b42a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["St3althPatchin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
