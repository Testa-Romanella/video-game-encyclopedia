It is a basic first person shooter game. Works on Windows XP, Vista,7,8, 8.1 and 10. To make sure it can run on your system I have included a system checker with the game. Simply run the program in Can I run FPSC games folder to check your system. If it tells you no, you simply have to install Direct X 9.0c .
