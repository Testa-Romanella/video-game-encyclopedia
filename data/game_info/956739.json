He is not just any ordinary knight, however. He has taken a potion that has turned him into a hulking mass of muscle, granting him incredible strength and endurance - a knight on steroids.\r\n</p>\n<p>The dungeon is known to be home to all manner of dangerous creatures, but the knight is undaunted. He enters the dark, foreboding space and begins to explore its winding corridors and twisting passages.\r\n</p>\n<p>As he makes his way deeper into the dungeon, he encounters goblins - the cowardly, mischievous creatures that lurk in the shadows. They are not easily defeated, but the knight on steroids is more than a match for them. With each goblin he defeats, he grows more confident, more powerful.\r\n</p>\n<p>But the deeper the knight ventures, the more dangerous the dungeon becomes. Monstrous creatures lurk in the shadows, waiting for their next victim. Will the knight on steroids be able to survive this deadly game of cat and mouse, or will he meet his match in the darkness? The only way to find out is to enter the dungeon and see for yourself.\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DONE IN 12H</strong></p>\n\n\n<strong>\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>\n</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T15:48:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72c/72cc71a16c041a567f9d46e97879e6ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gaser101"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
