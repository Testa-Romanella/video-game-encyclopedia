But, it's not an ordinary portal, nothing's coming out of it. Instead, the entire courthouse is sucked into it and you're transported to this weird dimension.</p><p>Your goal is to bake a teleportation pie to get back home.</p><p>Made for a 3 day gamejam with the theme \"food\". I had a different idea that I scrapped because it felt too daunting, so I made this on the last day.</p><p>It was my first gamejam, and first thing I make in RPG Maker, and it was quite fun tbh.</p><p>Update v1.02: NPCs crashing the game fixed and Ealyn's shop is now open.</p><p>Update v1.03: It should be possible to play the game from start to end now.
