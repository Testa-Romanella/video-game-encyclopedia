This was a mechanical prototype and, as such, was only developed with the full player-count in mind.</p>\n<p>Shutterbugs was made for exhibition alongside a collection of British seaside photography curated by\u00a0www.seasphotography.org.uk. It took just over two months and was developed to work inside a four-player arcade cabinet custom built for the exhibition at the Daphne Oram building at Canterbury Christ Church University.</p>\n<p>All environment art by Alan Meades.
