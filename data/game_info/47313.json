Toast soon comes to realize that this world was harder than the last and his only goal is to escape in any means possible. Everything is able to kill you but you are determined to finish. Why? Only you can decide that. It's a quick game or a long game depending on how skilled you are at shooting enemies and learning. It could take 10 Minutes to 4 Hours. Your goal is just to finish the game and get to the final room where you need to do one last task to win, pretty simple right?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1e/b1e1be1929f3fb52693f7451fe04c6bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GCRH"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Obscure Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
