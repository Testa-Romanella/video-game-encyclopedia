{"id": 809540, "slug": "foul-tongue-canned", "name": "Foul Tongue (Canned)", "name_original": "Foul Tongue (Canned)", "description": "<p>Made in Arcade Game Studio <em>Foul Tongue</em> was the project title for an arcade-style euro platformer that never got realised. Although development continued for many years afterwards in Unreal Engine. \u00a0Feature creep took hold and due to the the near limitless options for art in UE4 I was never quite happy with the style.</p>\n<p>The original story saw the characters Rei (Ghost,) Ryn (Satyr,) and Rua (Demoness) travel through many different themed realms in an adventure that would lead them to accept their differences from humanity; Rei was on a quest to reclaim her skin, so that she could fit in; Ryn was looking for her family but would find her independence. And Rua, she just wanted to recklessly kill, but would learn to be smart about her emotions. It wasn't very deep, but it didn't really need to be. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T09:26:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09d/09d74f440f5e3db65528bb1485b22e2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Oberlin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
