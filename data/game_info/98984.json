He'll be watching your every move, and he'll know if you've been bad or good - so don't mess up!</p><p>To get started, enter Santa's Sweatshop and press the yellow button on the Toy Kreator 20XD6 machine. Then try to make a toy that looks like one of the toys on the blueprint. Once your toy is assembled, throw it in the big red bag, or take aim at the smaller red bag for three times the points! Keep building more toys for additional time and to keep the boss happy. But beware, if you can't build the toys fast enough, you will ruin Christmas! </p><p>\n<strong>PROTOTYPE BUILD</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Made for the HTC Vive, although you may try it on the Touch (hasn't been tested, but let us know how it goes)</li>\n<li>This was a 3 week jammer as a Christmas gift to the world.</li>\n<li>6 toy variations</li>\n<li>Scoreboard</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Future features to come:</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Name input for scorekeeper</li>\n<li>More toys</li>\n<li>More audio</li>\n<li>Better optimization</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tMerry Christmas!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCreated by Steven Rivera, Mark McCallum and William Stallwood\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSpecial Thanks to Jason Harmon, Dave Bauer, Ricardo Rivera, Kevin Ritchie, Monogram</p><p>Made with Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aa2652e4139643f9836f05962170bfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["klipcollective"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
