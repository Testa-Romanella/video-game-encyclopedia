Progression through sections and levels require manipulation of factory mechanics. Puzzles may span multiple rooms and require the player to combine the mechanical functions of many elements such as, buttons, switches, walls and robots.</p>\n<p>Iron &amp; Egress incentivises alternative playstyles such as the completionist, through the use of optional puzzles, scorecards and collectables. Completion of all puzzles lead to hidden paths, collectables and eventually freedom. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T07:51:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9e/c9e43f212b58a49448047b41d5324d62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games@MQ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
