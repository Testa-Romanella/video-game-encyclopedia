If too many plants die, there won't be enough oxygen: game over. The tap creature goes around watering the plants from its tap (nose?). Occasionally allies come to the tap creature seeking water, they can help in different ways.</p>\r\nCurrent functionality\r\n<p>Currently the player has walk animations for each direction and can spout water particles. The plants have animations and gradually wilt, and then die. The player can walk around the world, and the camera gently follows, and the player collides with the edge of the world.\u00a0That's all we were able to implement. Initially the game was done in Unity, but midway through the game jam our main developer bailed so we bodged together a JavaScript version instead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d38/d38c96ecaf59a2da70f6ef8d03af90a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Polar stoat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
