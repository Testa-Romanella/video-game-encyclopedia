This is version 2.0, that included different types of ships, better city graphics, etc. It was very well received by the PV community, back then.</p>\n<p>Alien invaders are descending upon the city. Zap the UFOs by\u00a0touching them with the stylus.\u00a0The city achieves damage as invaders reach it. The game ends\u00a0when the city is completely destroyed.\u00a0The number of invaders increases each two levels. Their\u00a0speed increases each three levels.\u00a0During the game, you can quit by touching any hard icon in\u00a0the right half of the panel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T06:48:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a6/0a6c61db1152c595b514b12877c708f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Naranjito Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
