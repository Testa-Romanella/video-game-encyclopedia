Along with its second installment The Old Wild West which is a downloadable Demo in the website that was sadly canceled before completion but is still playable.</p>\n<p>These two both were made during Junior year of Highschool and got inspiration from games like\u00a0\u00a0Wild Guns on the SNES.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the first being made in JavaScript many things were made very simple to keep things fast as it was made in a week, however with the second installment made in unity I was able to make some better designs but I grew fond of the PacMan esc ghosts and decided to keep them. However, with the game being canceled because of other events, work on the game quickly stopped after the playable demo was finished; Yet after now having much more experience I plan to start again and make the third, and most likely final, installment of the games.\u00a0The Wild West.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T15:39:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7b/c7be99d31602ff0501ee0f9d560f49f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Minepurfekt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
