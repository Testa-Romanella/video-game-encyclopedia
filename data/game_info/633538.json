{"id": 633538, "slug": "bubblephobia", "name": "BubblePhobia", "name_original": "BubblePhobia", "description": "<p>How far can an ordinary man go to get rid of the fear that has plagued him for a lifetime?</p>\n<p>This is the second game I've created and this MiniJam is my first JAM, so I joined a bit not knowing what to do. With the bubble theme I decided to do something \"different and weird\" with the main character being afraid of them and in that same \"different and weird\" way I wanted to make a joke with how far a person goes by their fear, in case our character he makes a pact with a demon to finally kill every last bubble.  Originally it was supposed to be bigger, this is due to the fact that I didn't know what I would be able to create by myself at that time, but in my head it would have a much more humorous tone playing with such an idiotic fear, but that would put the character in situations extremes.  The end result was very small and confusing, but I managed to learn a lot of new things and despite the suffering the experience of doing it was really cool.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T03:20:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ac/4ac6607c72b0249751605d387c4a55ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GibraCorp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
