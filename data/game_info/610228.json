Its key feature is the intricately designed battles. The main character is an ordinary human that accidentally fell into the Room of Suffering, and players won't be able to return to the mortal realm unless they defeat every Sinner in the Room of Suffering.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li> As a turn-based indie game, it breaks out of the \"replay\" frame and adds \"Multiple reincarnations\" to the traditional turn-based mechanism. Steam early access will start on May 27, 2021[PT], and run for about 8 to 12 months, during which we will keep releasing new content, and eventually launch the game.</li></ul><h3>What is \"Multiple reincarnations\"? What's the difference between that and simply replaying the game?</h3><ul><li>It's a unique system that can be expanded endlessly. After clearing the current reincarnation for the first time, players will unlock new modes with different difficulties and rules, as well as the ability to enter the \"next\" reincarnation. The biggest difference is that the next reincarnation doesn't have defeated sinners with new rules, but a brand new group of stronger sinners altogether\uff01</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some say that turn-based games are a relic of the past, but we just wanted to put our best effort into creating a turn-based indie game that emphasizes the importance of not giving up. It's been two years since we started with nothing, and Suffering, a difficult indie game with a bold setting, unique and hardcore gameplay, and endless possibilities, is almost finished.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T02:25:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2dd2136df5911898ffa005b0fbb57836.jpg", "website": "https://www.killzero.cn/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 438, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u566c\u96f6\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u566c\u96f6\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
