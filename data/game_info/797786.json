Taking inspiration from Mario Galaxy, you jump around and between various planetoids to reach the end! Some parts may be difficult but I promise it is completable. Keep in mind that timing matters. Don't forget to look up and have fun!</p>\n\n<p>This is my first ever game jam! I made the mistake of choosing to make a 3D game, so I had very little time to make actual levels and assets after I got everything working, but I'm still incredibly proud of what I got done! I'm super happy to have this baseline to maybe make a proper game out of sometime. Thanks for playing!</p>\n\n<p>Vision of Persistence by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4592-vision-of-persistence</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T23:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f19/f197bbd952ebff4f181218e413b56b6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SerialBoxes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
