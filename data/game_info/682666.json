It's designed to boost your brainpower and get you learning faster.<br/>\nSchopenhauer spent years studying philosophy and literature in Germany. He tackled the most popular questions in philosophy, philosophy of thought, ethics, and epistemology. But these books are meant for children. In fact, he sees writing as a bridge where children can share the thoughts and knowledge they've learned outside of the classroom.\n\nSchopenhauer's principle was simple: \"If you want to learn, you need to learn from others. If you're going to question yourself, you need to question others.\" This involves you taking on the role of a teacher, encouraging others to think for themselves.\n\nBy teaching two kids how to write, then giving them the chance to review their ideas, Schopenhauer frequently found that their students would develop deeper and deeper understanding of principles of thought, with answers coming more quickly. Think about this: What if a child sat down and wrote ten letters and then any of them was hit with a lecture? Their result would be digested on their own time.\n\n'The school that teaches writing is the most important one, of course,' says Christian Bosse.\n\nLawrence W.
