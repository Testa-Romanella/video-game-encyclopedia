My brain decided to mix the two by looking back at all the projects that I started, but didn't finish, during my stint in university. (Spoiler alert:\u00a0It's a lot! But thankfully not THAT much more than the number of things I've actually completed at least)</p>\n<p>Some notable fragments are a murder mystery tabletop game inspired by an anime game that I've been working on since 2013, a basically complete but super messy Global Game Jam entry from 2016, and the classic failed overly-ambitious game that pretty much everyone has at least one of.<br/></p>\n<p>The HTML version is slower than the exe, so I recommend downloading it if you can (and are on PC). There's some real old, unoptimized, code involved and I don't wanna fix it! So no guarantees. (Oh also I\u00a0realize it's huge in browser, I would recommend zooming the page out until it's a comfortable size. I perpetually browse sites at like 70% size so I didn't even notice until now haha)</p>\n<p>Also available for download is a bunch of documents for the stuff I\u00a0mention in the game (additional game guides, more art, some notes, etc), so be sure to check that out if you want to see more old unfinished things!</p>\n<p>Throughout this set of like 8ish games, I\u00a0had some people that worked with me on a few of them! More specific credits are given in game, but here's I\u00a0think a general list.</p>\r\nRobert L Hudspethsounddude47Kerina McCarthy@ink-earVee Nowell@VeeGameDevAndrew Tran@BearLovingNerdJulia@haveanicewife", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T04:23:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb3/bb3ab9a7e95a3fbdebff4270949ca707.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Autumnotopia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
