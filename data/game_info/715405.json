{"id": 715405, "slug": "wingstone", "name": "WingStone", "name_original": "WingStone", "description": "<p>The game plays similarly to hearthstone but with some minor changes. It is mostly wings themed but there is some runescape memes\u00a0and other random stuff in there too.\u00a0If you click play right away you will be given a deck of random cards. If you go to edit deck you can build a custom deck (maximum of 3 copies of each card) and when you go back to the main menu it will save as a json file in the same directory that the game is in. If you delete this you will also delete the deck.\u00a0 The CPU will use random cards unless you select a deck for it to use on the main menu before you hit play. Choose watchpost if you want a bit of a challenge as it plays that deck best. The main difference from hearthstone is that instead of mana you have gold which can accumulate from your previous turn.\u00a0Have fun and let me know if you run into any bugs as the game is still in an early testing phase. Also if you have any recommendations for cards that I should add let me know and\u00a0I\u00a0may add them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T07:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/326ba028552fa970c97222d2c10e3519.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glockmog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
