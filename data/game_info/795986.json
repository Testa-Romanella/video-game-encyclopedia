The main objective is to determine whether customers can be allowed on the ride. There are many factors that prevent customers from riding such as height, weapons, hats, and food. Be careful - the more mistakes you make, the closer you get to being fired!\u00a0<strong>*Note - do not play game on Chrome.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Rule:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>The main mechanic is swiping left or right on customers to either deny or allow them on the ride.</li><li>There are three days total, with each day getting slightly more difficult. The wristbands also change everyday, so make sure to watch out for that!</li><li>There are four factors beside height\u00a0that prevent riders from being allowed: food, weapons, hats, and criminals.</li><li>There is a timer which encourages the player to be quick with their decision making.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>How do\u00a0I feel?</strong></p>\n<p>Our game hopes to bring some light humor and fun to whoever plays it. As two of the group members have worked at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, we wanted to share our experience of working at an amusement park to players. Of course, this simulator isn't a 100% accurate\u00a0job experience\u00a0(despite the game's logo).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Made by:</p>\n<p>Victoria Billings - Code and\u00a0Art</p>\n<p>William Morales - Code</p>\n<p>Karoline Lujan - Art &amp; Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T09:31:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/943/9439e85868b57de8fd9971230d79eb74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kaliluna"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
