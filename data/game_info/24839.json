Take on the role of either a young Polar Bear or a Walrus \n      growing up and trying to survive in the wild. From eating to fighting \n      off predators, almost every aspect of the animal\u2019s life is presented to \n      the player. Learning to live in this world is vital as they go from the \n      regular dangers to the extreme threats. Experience the thrilling, \n      interactive look at the walrus and polar bears that roam the vast world \n      of the Arctic wilderness. The gameplay will evolve as the animal's age \n      over eleven stages that take the player from snowy mountains, across \n      turbulent ice sheets that are ravaged by blizzards, and into the frigid \n      oceans that are patrolled by deadly killer whales. The stages alternate \n      between free-roaming areas containing several mini-games to travel \n      zones, which involve the player taking actions to get from one area to \n      another. The travel zones could be anything from descending a cliff face \n      from the mountains to the ice sheets below or surviving in the open \n      ocean as a storm rages around you.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/36356addc417001e48d212c7d9dfae96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "Nintendo DS", "Wii"], "developers": ["Atomic Planet Entertainment", "Atomic Planet"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Destination Software", "Zushi Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
