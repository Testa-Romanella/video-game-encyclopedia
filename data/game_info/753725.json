Your beautiful girlfriend, Monkina, is so stupid that one day she devolves into MONKE. The clan chief suspects witchcraft and locks her up to protect the clan. Rage overtakes you! You charge at the chief to save Monkina, but you are\u00a0weak and are unable to get close. The chieftain\u2019s guards beat you up and you get banished from your clan,\u00a0left to fend for yourself. But all you can think about is reuniting with Monkina and getting your revenge... Before getting banished you heard rumours that the hermit to the south of the base is the cause of Monkina's devolution. Determined to save her, you decide to seek him out, and return to MONKE yourself.</p>\n<p>The player's main objective is to rescue his beloved Monkina. To get back to her, you have to defeat several groups of your former allies. All you have on you is a slingshot, this slingshot can be loaded with different types of ammo.

Every ammo type has its own use and effect.</p>\n<p>*This game is still in development which is why the story above won't be playable yet*</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement (WASD)</p>\n<p>W = Forward movement<br/>A = Movement to the left<br/>S = Backwards movement<br/>D = Movement to the right</p>\n<p>Spacebar = Jump<br/>Shift = Sprint</p>\n<p>Right mouse button = Zoom/scope<br/>Left mouse button (hold to charge)\u00a0= Shoot</p>\n<p>Scroll wheel = Switching weapons</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T12:38:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc6da8943ebe41fe5475f413087b0b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fontys Game Design & Technology"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
