Beat your opponent and never received defeated through the 10 levels will be your ultimate challenge. </p><p>REGARDING MULTIPLAYER: To keep the party going in the levels of difficulty and the Heat Evolution offers to fight for points mode, the number of points won at \u00e9quivaux you are. So to win against the opposing ship you will get 28 points or so to be in the lead until the last level. </p><p>You are now ready to enter the battle!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/330/3304195265054f6daaaa2eb3b285ab2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Warkenji"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
