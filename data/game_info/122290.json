This is the first official release of my single man team, Re:Tri Studios! This is the fruits of a year's worth of labor learning a game engine and development skills. The game itself is very short, and can be completed in 30-45 minutes if you rush through it. If you explore and grind levels, probably 90 minutes tops. The game itself is free, but if you enjoyed it, consider donating so I can further hone my skills and produce even better content in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/978/978d2f22c1ac3126d35ed122239876d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Re:Tri Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
