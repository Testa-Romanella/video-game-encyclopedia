It's a 3D playground runner influenced by parkour running with the addition of a special ping ability that reveals areas that can speed the player up or slow them down. Hidden fast and slow lanes become visible, so it takes a bit of planning to plot a course through a world full of hazards \u2013 especially when the internet service providers themselves are actively trying to impede the player's progress. <br/><br/>In 404sight, the player attempts to traverse a level as quickly as possible without getting throttled by the ISPs, who actively throws slow tiles and inhibitors in their way. <br/><br/>This game was made by Retro Yeti Games, a team of graduate students currently enrolled in the Entertainment Arts and Engineering program at the University of Utah.</p><p>Website</p><p>Twitter</p><p>Facebook</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/590/590dcb3518221f56ba813fda3ac2651b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroYetiGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
