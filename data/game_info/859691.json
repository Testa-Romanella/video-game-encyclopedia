If you fail to do so, the controls will get issues and after some time ultimately, Robbie might break.</p>\n<p>Controls are very simple: A/D, Arrows or left stick on a controller to move - Space, Ctrl, or A-Button on a Controller to jump. Oil cans refill the Oil-Level, when collected. The yellow orbs allow you to do a double (triple, quadruple, \u2026) jump, when jumping right when Robbie\u2019s wheels touch them. Robie has three lifes and you can safely try everything during the tutorial. The actual game starts when you jump on the orange platform.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your objective: Get as far in the parcours as possible, in the quickest possible time. It\u2019s a simple platformer. This time, we added no highscore, so what about sharing your GameOver-Screenshots? :)\r\n</p>\n<p>This is the first ever COMPO-Experience I ever made so let me know what you think\u2026\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:45:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd5/bd5ae5e10924c9d9408027584ceb9ffe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Firesplash"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
