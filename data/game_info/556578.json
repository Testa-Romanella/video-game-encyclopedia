When you win a smaller board, it gives you a mark on the bigger board, and when you win the bigger board, you win the game. These extra rules give the game way more depth, and make the game more fun to play. I did not come up with the game idea myself; I just coded it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> game updated on Feb.11.2021 to support phones<br/></p>\r\nIn-depth Rules from\u00a0Wikipedia\u00a0:\r\n<p><em>\" Each small 3\u00d73 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board, and the larger 3\u00d73 board is referred to as the global board.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots. This move 'sends' their opponent to its relative location. For example, if X played in the top right square of their local board, then O needs to play next in the local board at the top right of the global board. O can then play in any one of the nine available spots in that local board, each move sending X to a different local board.</em></p>\n<p><em>If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire local board is marked as a victory for the player in the global board.</em></p>\n<p><em>Once a local board is won by a player or it is filled completely, no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play in any other board.</em></p>\n<p><em>Game play ends when either a player wins the global board or there are no legal moves remaining, in which case the game is a draw. \"</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3afc68bbf199b572d2be64a49746124.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Some-Antics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
