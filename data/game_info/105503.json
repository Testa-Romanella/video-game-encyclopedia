Right click to zoom in/out and \"R\" to reset. <br/> <br/><strong>Note:</strong> We ended up with just 12h to work on our Ludum Dare entry, so \"Dawning\" is probably way far from being well-balanced. Still had lots of fun working on it :-) </p><p><strong>Think you can beat us?</strong> Highscores are enabled here!<br/> <br/>---- <br/> <br/> <strong>Credits: </strong><br/> <br/>@ruben_oluwa - art <br/>@celer_gut - music &amp; sound <br/>@ludipe - design &amp; code </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:39:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/690/690b0f6297263d63a267cad73523fd1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ludipe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
