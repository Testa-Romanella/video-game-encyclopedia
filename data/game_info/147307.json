The three Pugs are based upon characters from Turbo Pug, Super Space Pug and Super Mega Neo Pug. The Pig is a wisecracking, female Gunslinger. <br/>Over the course of the game you'll travel across different worlds to fight against the super evil and villainous Pigolas the Cunning Ham. Pigolas is a very bad swine. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>If you've played role playing games since the 1990s, watched comedy movies like Bill and Ted, love some fun with cute animals and still have that Retro RPG itch, then you will most definitely enjoy Super Mega RPuG. <br/>Super Mega RPuG could be described as: Kingdom Hearts meets Star Trek. <br/> <br/>Super Mega RPuG is the first game made by a German father/son dev team. The former is a 30 year old who spent around 25 years of his live playing role playing games and the later, a 7 year old who loves animals and hates evil monsters.<p>Steam Greenlight:<br/></p><p>http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/...<br/></p><p>Kickstarter:</p><p>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/585607579/sup...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f0/2f018cdb24069183f2c486de28e2f510.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["judgedaring"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
