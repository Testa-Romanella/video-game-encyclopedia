The Kinda Funny crew just wrapped on a live episode of KFAF on twitch.tv/kindafunny, the show where Nick and Andy, \"@$#&amp; around a lot, and then it ends\" (Nick Scarpino, 2019). They then leave the set to go edit videos and drink iced coffees, except something's different this time...<br/><br/>Someone left their cup of Diet Choke on the set's coffee table, and due to over-carbonation in the soda dispenser it was filled with, the cup is primed to burst. What's wrong with a little spilled Diet Choke, though, right?<br/><br/>WRONG. Portillo, Greg of Kinda Funny's weiner dog, was sleeping nearby; now awakened by a burst of a Diet Choke cup on set, and drawn closer by the tantalizing smell of non-sugar-based-sweetener wafting into the air. <br/><br/>You, a group of tiny players dropped on the scene, must escape the Diet Choke spill and get to Porty so he doesn't drink unhealthy soda!<br/><br/>In other words: Race to the finish to get to Porty and flee to safety!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:49:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f54e31ee1263ff7f1f26c1cbf6fe5c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alxwlfe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
