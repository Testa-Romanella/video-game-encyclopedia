Attrition is a turn-based strategy game where three countries, Lutem, Bertas, and Cualitas, are constantly at war with one-another. Command their armies in a story of opposite opinions, sacrifices for one\u2019s beliefs, and the quest for a greater goal. Here no one\u2019s completely in the wrong, but no one\u2019s completely in the right.</p>\n<p>In the world of Attrition armies are simple, consisting only of troops armed with obsolete rifles, and not always having the capacity to move around with ease. A pair of dice controls how far an army can go, so commanders must adjust to every situation and get the most out of the terrain they\u2019re fighting in. Here the lucky have the advantage, but the better strategist comes out victorious.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b38/b38cbe7300c4b41d181d39debcdd3083.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LMG3864"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
