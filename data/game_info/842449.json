Although realistic in its depiction of war-torn Copenhagen, and based on real accounts, the fictional experience unfolds like dimly recalled fragments of a painful memory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe audience is placed in the passenger seat of a rowboat with six degrees of freedom, sitting face to face with Josef. Through the physical proximity to him and his vivid stories of both heroic and immoral acts, the audience become intimate observers of the trauma experienced by a young man forced to flee his own country.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe experience reflects on the theme of survivor's guilt and the impossible choices that people on the run have to make in order to save their own lives.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T04:08:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9df27a766bad008d82ffd5d4e29fe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Novelab", "Makropol"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Astrea"], "esrb_rating": null}
