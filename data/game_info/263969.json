But what happens when you cannot find three other players?  This is the app for you!  It allows you to play anywhere, anytime.<br/><br/>The four players are divided into two team, with partner sitting opposite each other at the table.  The game is comprised of several rounds of play (called \u201chands\u201d) where the players compete for the right to name trumps by being the high bidder.  <br/><br/>After shuffling, each player draws seven dominos.  Bidding begins with the player to the left of the dealer.  Each player either passes or bids the number of points the player estimates the hand is worth.  There is only one round of bidding and the player with the highest bid gets to name trumps and play first.  <br/><br/>Each player, plays in turn, following suit where possible.  The high domino takes the trick.  At the end of the hand, if the high bidder did capture at least as many points as bid then that team scores a mark.  If not, then the bidder is set and the other teams scores a mark.<br/><br/>The first team to score seven marks wins the game.  <br/><br/>A very enjoyable game for hours of fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dd/0dde67bbc086c5c17274914cd9ec0b3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Michael Burkett"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Michael Burkett"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
