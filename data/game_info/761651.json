It started as a 2d-side-scrolling action adventure, before we realized it needed to be a bit more expansive. So, we blew the roof off the universe and decided to harness the power of light and darkness to explore the themes set by the Darkness Game Jam. That involved us exploring the possibility of creating a board-game-esque puzzler, with similarities to Civilization.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>However, we eventually realized that mimicking a $60 game would be a bit much for two days of work, and we pulled back our ambitions marginally. We loved the idea of using an interplay of light and shadow as a primary concept, so we decided to stick with it. However, our first iteration wasn't very fun, so we changed course a bit and built more of a simplistic puzzler in order to improve the engagement factor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T10:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a2e9a0f3b4a5030d21b01cddb13c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kodrick Gaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
