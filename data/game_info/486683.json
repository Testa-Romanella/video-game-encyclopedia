There are also 'bugs' that we'll leave you to discover.</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys for moving and jumping, there is no attacking in this game.</p>\n<p>Backstory: We were actually planning on make an arena game with changing maps, but got overwhelmed with errors of code not working on one person device, but working fine on the other. And we got this game, which isn't what we imagined! In conclusion, sometimes you just gotta do what the computer offers, and with that, we bring you the Temple of Belief...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, I (Darren) am planning to extend this game after the jam. Please comment things you would like to see in the future.
