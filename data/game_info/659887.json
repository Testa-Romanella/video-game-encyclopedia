Theme is rotation. We accomplish this theme by having the player rotate cubes to press a button. For each cube the player is rewarded with 1 Kenney asset. There are 50 unique Kenney assets to discover!</p>\n<p>This is a VR project. There is no way to play this without a headset. It should work with any Windows headset however we only have controllers mapped for Vive and Oculus Rift. It will also work on Oculus Quest and Quest 2.</p>\n<p>Open source on Github:\u00a0https://github.com/Troy-Story-Games/rotation-station</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T15:03:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b2245c20e7e3aa3b09479491b5e2234f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Troy Story Games", "TethysRiver"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
