This project is based on an idea I\u2019ve had for awhile, albeit greatly simplified. This is the first time I\u2019ve tried out using PlayMaker for Unity, and I have to say it\u2019s a worthwhile investment just for it\u2019s implementation of finite state machines. I completed this game in around 8 hours.</p>\n<p>The premise is at it says at the bottom of the screen - to use the abilities given to you to Delight the faces (Delighted faces are green with a big smile). You\u2019ll need to delight at least 7 faces to win. What does \u201cDelighting\u201d them entail? Experiment a bit to find out!\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n<strong>Mouse Driven</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:02:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ab/5abe8808b31f7cb0c9e5558cbe0da5eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Richard Stack"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
