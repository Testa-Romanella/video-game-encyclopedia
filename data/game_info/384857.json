There are 14 unique enemies to fight\u00a0and 3 main-quest lines to go through along with 5 side-quest lines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0created Quest a couple years back using C++ without an engine.\u00a0This version of Quest showcases the first area for the game along with a little bit after that. For now, I have discontinued working on Quest since I\u00a0reached a good place to stop and I have been focusing on my college work and making new projects with the new tools I\u00a0have learned. I may pick up working on Quest again later, since I\u00a0really like how the game has turned out, but it will need a lot of reworking if I\u00a0were to turn this into a full fledged game.</p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<ul><li>WSAD - Move</li><li>Enter - Interact</li><li>E - Inventory</li><li>Q - Check Stats</li><li>L - Increase Screen Size</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T04:29:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f86/f86a73f248303ba9ecf11c483defa963.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Caden Messenger"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
