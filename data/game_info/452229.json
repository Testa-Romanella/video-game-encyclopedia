I made it in more or less a week.\u00a0It may still have issues, but I like it as it is for the moment. Maybe I'll touch it up again when the jam is over, though. Probably minor changes though: stuff like a splash screen, a non default icon, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>THE GAME:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a 2d platformer with shooter elements. It was made with Gamemaker Studio 2, and at the moment it's only available for Windows. Control scheme is as follows: <strong>A/D </strong>to move, <strong>spacebar</strong> to jump, <strong>mouse</strong> to aim, <strong>left click</strong> to shoot.<br/></p>\n<p>The game also has two different endings.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Sprites:</strong>\u00a0Foliage and Rocks by Pierre Gris.</li><li><strong>Sprites: </strong>Default Rabbit by Julien Durandau.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Open source assets:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Sprites:</strong> Simple Explosion, by NiceGraphic (https://opengameart.org/content/simple-explosion).</li><li><strong>Audio: </strong>Elevator Music and Elevator Music 2, by Pro Sensory (https://opengameart.org/content/elevator-music, https://opengameart.org/content/elevator-music-2).</li><li><strong>Audio:</strong> Unrequited Attention, by Meavy\u00a0Boy (https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Meavy_Boy/EP_71_to_20/Unrequited_Attention).</li><li><strong>Audio:</strong>\u00a0Gymnop\u00e9die No.1, by Eric Satie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU)/</li><li><strong>Photos: </strong>Forest and Rocks taken from\u00a0https://www.pexels.com/.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:31:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad2/ad2c3d8f0d252c63c05657d1d0f7e0d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ecplav"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
