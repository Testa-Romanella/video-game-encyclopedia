It's not very common<br/>- This one isn't a bug but I didn't spend as much times I'd like to on this game &gt;-&gt; If you miss a note you will not be penalized. Couldn't decide if I wanted to penalize players for missing especially because I was envisioning this as a cute,\u00a0more narrative rhythm game if that makes sense?
