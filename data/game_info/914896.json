Combo your different band members\u2019 cards to unleash devastating attacks and shred your opponents.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Be careful though because if a band member falls in battle you\u2019ll lose them and access to their cards in future battles until you revive them at a pit stop. <br/>Discover new cards as you bar brawl stage-to-stage, unlocking new strategies to take down demons and strengthening your instruments of destruction. Choose your way through a branching path filled with battles, merchants, random encounters, and valuable rest locations to heal and revive fallen characters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We're big fans of:<br/><ul><li>Slay the Spire<br/></li><li>Monster Train<br/></li><li>Darkest Dungeon</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T04:47:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6f0f45fe49faef7d6eb064df26a222.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "toplay": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big Blue Bubble"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Blue Bubble"], "esrb_rating": null}
