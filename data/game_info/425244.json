This is a silly little game I made when I found out about bitsy. If you don't know what that is,  it's a cool little tool that lets you make simple little games like this.</p>\n<p>This was originally going to be a weeklong project, but it ended up taking several months of off-and-on work to get into a place where I am happy with it. I hope you enjoy playing it!</p>\n<p>Some control notes:</p>\n<ul><li>Use arrow keys to move around and interact</li><li>Just move into a thing or person to interact with them</li><li>Some items can be picked up and will be in your invisible inventory</li><li>If asked if you would like to do something, interact with the object again to do so. \u00a0Example: \"Would you like to play this game?\" Interact with the character who asked you to play once more to say yes.</li><li>Entering the Pie House is a 'no turning back' point. Collect anything you think you want to before entering. Leaving will start the game's ending sequence.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T02:07:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a85/a85c3ddc0db810e7cfde61093432095b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ASpaceWorm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
