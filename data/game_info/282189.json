Currently working on the core game mechanics and interface before fleshing out tower and enemy types. Art is not anywhere close to final. Feedback on balance (how far you get, when did you start getting bored) and interface would be particularly useful at this moment but feel free to comment on anything.</p>\n<p>Check back frequently for updates- I\u00a0am constantly updating the game.</p>\n<p>Your feedback is greatly appreciated and thanks for playing!</p>\n\n\n<br/>\n<p>Join the Discord community server to speak with me directly, give feedback, share your progress and strategies, or just hang out and chat!</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/Fu5tpuV<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>You can reach out to me on Twitter too if you prefer that.
