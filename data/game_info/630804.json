As the Binman, you must take out the bins, feed energy to the incinerator, and stop evil!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Context:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Mr Bin Mann, Born July 4th 1973, lived in an unknown country in an unknown province.\u00a0One thing was sure though. There was a lot of bins, and a need for them to be emptied. Mr Mann spent his childhood learning the methods of Garbage collection from his master, Mr Garb Age. At 18, Bin Mann started his long career in Garbage collection, and hasn't looked back since.</p>\n<p>Incinerator Plants are a perfect way of generating electricity (if not for all of it's imperfections). The idea of powering a nation using their waste sounds very appealing, especially to the entrepreneurial Binman. In the Bin-Go! extended universe, all power is generated by such means.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer, do not try to resurrect your beloved pet using 20,000V of electricity, no matter how cherished they were.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>More Context:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made by Ned Reid over two days for Bingo Jam.
