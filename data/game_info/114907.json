Your mad king has had enough waiting. Can you figure out the Secret of Alchemy without poisoning yourself, burning your tower down, or transforming rats into mindless abominations? Each game is unique, since your starting potions - and even the Rules of Alchemy - change with each playthrough. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Only a mouse required!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
