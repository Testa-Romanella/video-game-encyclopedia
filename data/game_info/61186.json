It&#39;s a life simulator, meaning you have to survive, adapt and craft. As you advance in game your can also customize houses and cars the way you have always wanted to! We would first like for players to try it in a solo experience, partly because some of our features are in progress, and we are working hard to perfect them and to give the best experience to the players before anything else and, partly because we want them to give us a fresh opinionated look onto what we have done so far and we would like them to explore the title as it is now, in its Alpha state.<br />\nThe main idea around the game is based on combining different types of gameplay, for example: survival games, life simulator games, shooters, (partially) horror games and so on!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbcc9c022baf7aad50626344c78c0ee2.jpg", "website": "https://backtonormalstudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BackToNormal Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BackToNormal Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
