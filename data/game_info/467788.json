The theme was \"Out of Control\"\u00a0which made me think of a platformer where you couldn't control the character and suddenly he just did stupid things like walking off a cliff or waving his arms around and spitting everywhere.</p>\n<p>But why would that happen? That's when\u00a0I came up with the pills and the lab and how he needs the pills to stay smart enough to understand the player's instructions.</p>\n<p>After that it was just about creating a fun atmosphere and getting a couple levels in.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it! If you have a gamepad plugged in, you'll need to use that.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, keyboard is a little more difficult but still manageable with some practice.</p>\n<p>No coyote time yet!\u00a0Sorry! Needed to submit!</p><p>Note:\u00a0If you get stuck you can reload the level by pressing select +\u00a0start or \"R\" on the keyboard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d174e64916d6a46fa1c5622922ebdc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silhouette Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
