In the game, the player controls a motorcycle against time and other computer-controlled bikes. It was one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and Sega&#39;s &quot;Super Scaler&quot; technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates.[5] It also introduced a motion-controlled arcade cabinet, where the player&#39;s body movement on a large motorbike-shaped cabinet corresponds with the player character&#39;s movements on screen, inspiring arcade games that followed and anticipating the modern motion control trend.[6][1]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T15:20:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c91/c919400e9914028fd6dc7fe5e46c097c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["SEGA Master System", "SEGA Saturn"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
