Unfortunately, an evil Technophobe who wishes to rid the world of all robots has travelled to the past and prevented the Wheel, Lever, Screw and Pulley from ever being invented. This has paradoxical repercussions for the robots of the future, who are now debilitated and barely functional without these essential parts.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCan our robotic hero save the future of technology?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPlay the game to find out!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5a/b5acb82d94ac9badd6d695bc6a30db1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Reinvent the Wheel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
