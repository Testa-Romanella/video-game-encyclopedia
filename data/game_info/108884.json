The result was pretty interesting and I enjoyed it lot! There's also a lot of space to expand on this idea.<br/></p>\n<p>Your objective in this game is to completely use your deck and reach the door that appears at the end when you do so. <br/>There are basically two types of cards:<br/>\u00a0- New section cards: used to place new rooms with some base layouts.<br/>\u00a0- Modifier cards: used on rooms to modify their rules or layout.</p>\n<p>You have to cleverly place your cards so you use all of them and still be able to beat the level. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- Mouse to drag and drop cards<br/>- Arrows or AD to move<br/>- Z or Space to Jump<br/>- X or Left Ctrl to RUN</p>\n<p>Controller supported for the Platform part.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/805f23e944abf92bc9c8ea7bad3e5625.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["lex-m"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
