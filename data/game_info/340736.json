Avoid cacti and escape from the heatwave by jumping, sliding, and boosting to make the delivery right\u00a0on time.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>[WASD] or Arrow Keys to Move - [A] to Slow Down, [D] to Speed Up</li><li>[S] or Arrow Key Down to Slide</li><li>[SPACE] to Jump</li><li>[Q] to Boost</li><li>[ESC] to Pause</li><li>[ENTER] or [SPACE] to Select</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>If in the heatwave, your Energy Bar will be rapidly reduced. If you have no Energy and are caught in the heatwave, you will be exhausted and the level will restart.</li><li>When your Energy Bar is depleted, you move slightly slower. Keep your energy up!</li><li>Ice Cubes restore almost 1/2 of your Energy Bar.</li><li>Boosting doubles your speed for a short duration of time but uses 1/4 of your Energy Bar.</li><li>Boosting destroys cacti - you can use this to escape prickly situations at the cost of your Energy.</li><li>Sliding too long slows you down!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Art - Nhoconic</li><li>Programming - StealthNinja</li><li>Level Design - Substitute</li><li>Tire Squeal sound by Mike Koenig.
