The skateboarder must stay in the air for as long as possible while collecting the foods presented to him. The more food he collects the faster he will fall. The fact that the apple gives the skateboarder double the normal points makes it so that the player is rewarded more for getting the apple but it also make the game more difficult as compared to collecting the pizza or energy drink. This symbolises the idea of having a balanced diet. Eating healthy might not feel very rewarding but at the end of the day, we will see how a healthy eating can positively impact us.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:13:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e93/e93edc1e05ec606bb9eb7935b9fac770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NerdyGeek"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
