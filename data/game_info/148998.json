The theme of the competition was fast so I called this game Speed Farrow, farrow being a combination of fast+arrow. Obviously, since I did not have much time to develop this game, there are a few unpolished parts. Anyways, I hope you try this game out for yourself!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d7/0d77429ccdf573e8766ae10b62c701ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Frost"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
