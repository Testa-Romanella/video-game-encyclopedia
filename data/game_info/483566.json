Definitely could use a bit of polish on some of the movement/perspective transitions. I also had planned to create an interior map that would be a bit more maze-like. <br/></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Engine: Godot 3.2.1<br/>Art Assets: Kenney (https://kenney.nl/assets)<br/>Menu Music: Brandon Morris<br/>Background Music: Alex McCulloch<br/>Game Over &amp; Victory Music:\u00a0Christian DeTamble</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:40:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be9/be9090c279a39fb6019a43120f80e669.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alexanderzahir"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
