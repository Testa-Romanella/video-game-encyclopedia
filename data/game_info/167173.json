To hack an object, click on it. Once it glows, use Q and E to adjust the values. When hacking a box, use tab to switch between horizontal and vertical direction.\u00a0Press R to reset the level. Press B to reset boxes if you lose them. If your mouse disappears, hit \"esc\" and it should reappear.</p>\n<p>Our game is about a character escaping from a game by hacking the objects around them. The character goes through levels and they become more and more  aesthetically like the inside of a computer rather than a game. The final level see's the character escape.</p>\n<p>We currently have one level and 2 hacking powers: growing bridges and moving boxes. Bridges (both horizontal and vertical) can be grown and shrunk down. Boxes can be moved in a certain direction. Boxes and bridges can be stood on and be used to turn off buttons that control electricity.</p>\n<p>Currently mostly finished\u00a0by Tom Barezer Ayalon, Gabby Delforge, Darren Wang, Sabrina Wong, Christopher Yun</p>\n<p>Feel free to reach out to us with any questions!
