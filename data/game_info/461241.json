You play as one of our two characters; the power-type \u201cLobster Cat\u201d and speed-type \u201cRapid Rat\u201d. Using a variety of different hits &amp; combos, it\u2019s up to you to determine whether you have what it takes to demolish your opponent\u2019s court before they destroy yours with our tug-of war style scoring system! Falling behind &amp; accumulating holes across your side of the court? Not to worry! Get back at your opponent by scoring points yourself, destroying their court &amp; having yours patched up in turn! You may know how to Set the ball, but will you be able to take advantage of it &amp; Spike?</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>When you are in the court and pause the game, in the top right corner you can now see your IP. If you are the hosting player and have successfully port forwarded port 7777, you can send the IP to the second player.<br/></p>\n<p>The second player can then go to the new find session and type in the IP and they need to make sure Use Port is checked if they are playing on different networks. <br/>For LAN you can either create an online game as host and don't use the port as player or you create a LAN game as host and search for LAN games as a player.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (keyboard/controller):</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: <strong><em>WASD/left joystick</em></strong><br/>Jump: <strong><em>Spacebar/A</em></strong><br/>Overhead hit: <strong><em>J/X</em></strong><br/>Spike: <strong><em>K/Y (in air)</em></strong><br/>Underhand hit: <strong><em>L/B</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Design and Production</p>\n<ul><li>David van der Waals</li><li>Robin Jansen Eyken Sluyters</li><li>Sem Lefering</li><li>Antonie Martinovich van der Meer (Itch.io page admin)</li></ul>\n<p>Visual Art</p>\n<ul><li>Aileen van de Pas</li><li>Abigail Putri Simanjuntak</li><li>Veronica Redlaff\u00a0(Itch.io page admin)</li></ul>\n<p>Programming</p>\n<ul><li>Tristan van Veenhuijzen</li><li>Szymon Tydrych</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Computer Specs required to play</strong></p>\n<p>Minimum 25-35 FPS</p>\n<ul><li>CPU: 2 Cores, 4 Threads</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GT 710 -2gb\u00a0 or AMD Vega 8</li><li>Storrage HDD: 2gb of free space\u00a0</li><li>RAM: 8gb</li></ul>\n<p>Recommended\u00a0 ~60 FPS<br/></p>\n<ul><li>CPU: 4 Cores, 8 threads</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GTX 750TI\u00a0 or AMD Radeon\u00a0HD 6950</li><li>Storrage SSD: 2gb of free space\u00a0</li><li>RAM: 16gb</li></ul>\n<p>If you have any feedback/suggestions or you encountered a bug please share it with us either in one of the provided forms\u00a0or in the discussion boards below!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:44:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/578/578001b4df9cb2428db3d9873ef76c6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IGAD Breda University of Applied Science"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
