{"id": 961339, "slug": "ghost-maze-2", "name": "Ghost Maze", "name_original": "Ghost Maze", "description": "This is a short game where the player will encounter a small maze with several locked doors. <br/> The player must gradually find some hidden chests and collect keys to open the doors and unlock new parts of the maze. <br/><br/><br/><br/> The player will have three improvement points, a bar for running, a bar for loading the weapon, and a bar for slowing down the game, which helps a lot when the player needs to think fast. <br/> Start the game by collecting the yellow balls until you reach the required amount to unlock the weapon. <br/><br/><br/><br/> After the weapon is unlocked, find and destroy all the ghosts. After destroying all of them, prepare to fight a character that is not Pacman (any resemblance is mere coincidence), while also looking for the chests with the keys. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to find the hidden treasure at the end of the maze. The game is short, and experienced players should finish it in just over an hour. The controls are simple: aim with the mouse, left-click to shoot, right-click to use the slow-motion effect while displaying a map showing the positions of enemies and gates, and the Shift key to run.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T05:05:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc0/dc047854f752adf486b5c4bb21044761.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artur Rezende"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PROATIV GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
