Me neither, but here we are.<br/></p>\n<p>Karaoke Ninja is the amalgamation of <strong>stealth</strong> and <strong>music</strong> (!). You control the Black Ninja, dodging and weaving to escape a dark fortress littered with deadly laser beams and guarded by a legion of Red Ninja, who have a quirky little habit of killing your butt. You however choose not to murder them, as part of a personal mantra, but mainly not to stain your velvet robes. So what CAN you do?</p>\n<p>Well, you are able to conjure musical notes* in physical forms. PlatFORMs, to be specific.</p>\n\n<p><em>*Chromatic scales only, Dorian / Egyptian scales were in the works but my desktop screen wasn\u2019t big enough</em></p>\n<p>Sing, talk, scream, play a video, play piano, play guitar (you probably need more than one person), anything that will take your ninja one step closer to freedom!</p>\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for? Get your Blue Yetis and Sennheisers and let\u2019s stealth the roof off this place!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 41.</p>\n<p><em>[Sadly Unity microphone input\u00a0doesn't work in HTML5, but I made a port for all three major OSes!]</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2a/a2a11bb7d9b970fbb9e3ba461e37914f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gastric Sparrow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
