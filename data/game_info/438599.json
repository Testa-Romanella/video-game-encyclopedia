Your enemies perform a dance-like sequence of attacks to an epic rock opera. BPM is inspired by retro shooters of the 90\u2019s. It is fast, frenetic and rhythmical. You can double jump, dash, rocket jump and bunny hop to evade your opponents.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to reach the end of randomly generated dungeons, collecting different weapons, abilities and items each time you play. These weapons and abilities can radically alter the way you play, making each playthrough unique.</p>\n<p>You must defeat 7 bosses to reach the final boss. Each boss moves and attacks in a unique way that you must learn to exploit if you want to succeed. Some attacks require you to jump over fields of lava, some to dodge fast projectiles, some to hold fast for a beat.<br />\nFeatures:<br />\nShoot, jump and dodge to the beat while battling hordes of enemies.<br />\nFight powerful bosses in challenging boss battles that will push you to the edge.<br />\nExplore randomly generated dungeons.<br />\nChoose from 5 different characters with unique strengths and weaknesses.<br />\nWield a powerful arsenal of weapons, all with different behaviour for firing and reloading to the beat of the soundtrack.<br />\nBattle a diverse array of enemies, each with unique rhythmic behaviours.<br />\nGet overpowered and fire shotgun rockets while flying through the air.<br />\nUtilize abilities that radically alter the way you play the game, from teleport to freezing bolts.<br />\nEquip over 40 items that buff your character in unique and interesting ways.<br />\nExperience an epic rock opera soundtrack.<br />\nChallenge modes for extra gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2020-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T03:30:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2b/c2b429bae0320697ba983b8ee9feb19e.jpg", "website": "https://bulletsperminute.com", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 67, "owned": 1017, "beaten": 60, "toplay": 62, "dropped": 61, "playing": 20}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 57, "ratings_count": 125, "suggestions_count": 551, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 126, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Awe Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awe Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
