I created all the art work (minus the font which was sourced from dafont.com and the explosion sprite sheet which I got from google images). Equally I did the sound design and wrote the song although a few sound effects were taken from my downloaded libraries. I hope you enjoy the game! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaf/aaf5eae6f365a5807f805cbccbe4971f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RobFenemore"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
