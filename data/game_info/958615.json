Your job will be to keep a close eye on the animatronics and make sure everything is running smoothly. However, things may not be as simple as they seem.\r\n\r\nRumors have been circulating about strange and unsettling events that have taken place at the restaurant after hours. Some claim that the animatronics have been acting strangely, wandering around the restaurant on their own and even appearing in places they shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nAs the night watchman, you'll have access to the restaurant's security cameras and other tools to keep an eye on the animatronics. But be warned, the job can be quite challenging and unnerving. You'll need to make sure to keep an eye on the animatronics at all times, as they have been known to move and even attack after hours.\r\n\r\nTo help you along the way, you'll have access to a limited power supply, which you'll need to manage wisely to ensure that the cameras and other equipment stay operational throughout the night. If the power runs out, the security doors that keep you safe will be disabled, leaving you vulnerable to attack.\r\n\r\nSo, are you ready to take on the challenge of working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza? Can you survive the night shift and uncover the secrets that lie within the restaurant's walls? Only time will tell. Good luck, and don't forget to keep your wits about you.\r\n\r\n\n<em>FEATURES</em>\r\n- 5 nights\r\n- Custom nights\r\n- Easter egg\r\n<em>CREDITS</em>\n<strong><em>Codeur - Texturing world</em></strong>\u00a0: FoggoDev\r\n<em>Model - animator 3D</em>\u00a0: Oska Oskera\r\n\r\n-\u00a0Discord", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T19:10:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39b881648d68e4e204b3f684de69dd4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["foggo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
