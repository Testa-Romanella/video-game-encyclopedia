Just as the player\u00a0finds it exponentially more difficult to accomplish previously simple tasks with the loss of each ability, some of our parents, for instance, struggled with language barriers that made even setting up simple\u00a0doctors appointments (or self-advocacy at them)\u00a0daunting. In just ten short weeks, we set out to replicate their experience.</p>\n<p>Join Dru as she faces the same trials, leaving everything she knows behind and sacrificing both her native tongue and abilities in order to pursue a new life elsewhere.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em>Please continue to support us on Twitter @BiqsyDevTeam and\u00a0contact us at biqsydevteam@gmail.com!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T02:38:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb4b8523cfdb427c2c0e1af4050aa1dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gameheads"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
