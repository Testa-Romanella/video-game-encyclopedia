This time around, Mel is trying to escape\u00a0 with the Realmwalker gauntlet, an experimental piece of technology that allows the user to jump at will\u00a0 between this world and another. Of course, this is Mel\u2019s most difficult heist yet as she not only has to avoid obstacles from the real world but also the altered version of reality.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Use the Realmwalker gauntlet to your advantage as you go over, around, and through the dangers that\u00a0 lie ahead. Not only will laser walls and electric floors block your path, but enemies from both dimensions\u00a0 will try to stop you. It is your goal to master the timing of your new realm-swapping abilities to evade\u00a0 these obstacles and escape the facility.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\r\nInstant Noodle Studios\r\n<p>Davis Canby \u2013 Designer and Producer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Devin Schwehr \u2013 Programmer and Level Designer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cory Theel \u2013 Programmer and Sound Designer\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Morgan Lander \u2013 3D Modeler, Concept Artist, and Texture Artist\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Trevor Malpede \u2013 3D Modeler, Rigger, and Animator\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Paul Ruppar \u2013 Concept Artist, UI Designer and Texture Artist\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/931/931af8887f696d5adb9beccad921cad8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Instant Noodle Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
