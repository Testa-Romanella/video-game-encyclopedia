First time doing anything with 3D, first time really messing with shaders, and my first time making a racing game. If there is interest though I'll finish it up, add a bunch of maps, mechanics, and such. Oh and sound. Totally ran out of time to put in sound.\u00a0Hope you enjoy what is done so far! And thanks for checking out my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:42:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b967323258a730295f94c822cf0a1e70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frostdream Games"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
