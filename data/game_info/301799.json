It does not have all features and its not even ready for alpha stage yet but I thought I'd throw it up here just to have it here if anyone wants to see what it looks like.</p><p>Use W, A, S, and D to move around, after picking up your weapons use the 1, 2 and 3 keys to switch between them. Use your primary mouse button to shoot when holding a gun. The green cubes are the enemies for now. Have fun! <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:06:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/586/586b4f4efa3813c4a78c063c1b40128b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheOnly1ZombieGamer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
