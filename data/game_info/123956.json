I was 12 or 13 years old at the time and I was experimenting with Game Maker (version 6.1 at the time). I made this game for a Winter Game Contest.</p><p>Here's the link to where it was originally posted: LINK</p><p>It was played a lot by the community and a lot of users enjoyed the game at the time. My friends at middle school thought it was cool. I even saw people that I didn't know sit in the school library and play it!</p><p>I converted it to work with Windows Vista, 7, and 8 and left it in it's original form so everyone could see how much I have grown as a developer since long ago.</p><p>All the graphics, story, level design, and music was done by me. My parents helped me out a lot with supporting me through development, often staying up late and watching me design it.</p><p>The first boss (the walrus) was drawn by somebody in the Game Maker community and given to me. I think his name is still in the credits page in the game. Thanks friend!</p><p><strong>ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p><p>A platform game where you are a penguin who has to save the snow!
