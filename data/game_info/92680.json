If you water the plant with tainted tap water, it will die. Each day you must water it; you can also listen to the radio and look out the window. Each game lasts a week, though players have the ability to fast forward time, or linger on an experience, as they experience the feeling of waiting for water to recede, and for life to resume.\"</p>\n<p><strong>\u2013 Bruce Lampros, </strong>Art Papers, May/June 2016</p>\n<p>Created as part of Indie Grits 2016's Waterlines project.</p>\r\n\"when the flood hit, much of the city was inaccessible.\r\n<p>Dams burst, bridges failed and roads were impassible under pools of water.
