I am working on a big game and by my estimations it will take at least 5 years, most likely way more than 5 years. It is quite daunting. And I am trying to find some way to speed run the game development. To do it I need to develop some tools that would help me. And I decided to make some miny projects miny games to show off the technology.</p>\n<p>In this game I was trying to figure out how I can use GPT-3 for story-telling.\u00a0This is a sort of text-based game.
