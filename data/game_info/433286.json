Explore three levels full of ever-escalating security, avoid patrols and surveillance, and try to bring our mythical friends to safety.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Use WASD or the arrow keys to move the character, E to pick up and drop creatures. Bring the creatures to the extraction zone at the start of the level in order to release them (by pressing E once in the extraction zone). After they are release, you can finish the level by holding E for a second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Avoid the guards and the cameras, if you end up in their line of sight, try to escape as quickly as possible in order to avoid failing the level.</p>\n<p>Created over the span of three days\u00a0for Ludum Dare 46. We hope you give it a try, enjoy it, and we'd love to hear as much feedback as possible, be negative or positive, don't hesitate to leave us a comment.</p>\n<p>Code by\u00a0https://twitter.com/IanZG</p>\n<p>Art design by\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/sparrowich/</p>\n<p>Sound design by\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/tmikic100/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/739/739e68caeb9ddb8262de6765d3fb9a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Feel Good OPG"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
