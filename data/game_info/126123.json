It was originally being made for the Game By Its Cover 2016 game jam, though I intend on expanding it after the jam is complete.  My initial plan was simply to construct a cute and tiny game to ensure that I never got overwhelmed and that I could complete it within the 30 day deadline, which I feel I managed to do quite well.</p>Open Source:<p>I programmed the game from scratch using C++ and SDL.  It is open source (licensed under the LGPL), and the repository can be found here.</p>Contact:<p>If you would like to give me feedback, modify the game, or anything else, I'd love to hear from you!  You can send me a tweet (@Frozelar) or send me an email (frostyfish88@gmail.com).</p>Thanks for checking out my game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/640/640743699d97c180932e1a705cf19546.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frozelar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
