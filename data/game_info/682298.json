Can you create instruments that feel 'gamey'? What can spatial audio do to enhance an experience? Those questions were our guiding design philosphy. John Talbot handled concept, programming, and audio implementation while Minno created those lovely sounds you hear.<br/><br/>We wanted to do a lot more, but John is not a native programmer and at this point, we'd rather put it out there than just continue to put it off for forever. Just know that because this is a prototype, it's a little janky! (You have to look at the robots' spheres and press e to get them to start wildin' out for example)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD- Move</p>\n<p>Mouse- Look</p>\n<p>E- Interact</p>\n<p>Esc- Exit Application</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T07:49:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b3/1b3c26cc04d4fdcc80ed68760870d888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["talbeats"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
