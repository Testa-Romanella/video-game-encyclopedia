After recreating the game itself, I added the end scene where it appears like the original game poster. As the sudden change in color and text felt unrefined, I decided to add a color-shifting transition so that it felt more natural and fluid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the major interactions done, I went back to the feedback I got from the game poster and attempted to improve the current design. One major critique of the original game poster was that it was drab due to the color palette used in it. With that in mind, I decided to shift away from the greys and changed it to varying shades of blue for the background. Along with the changes of the background, I decided to lighten the red color of \"Microsoft Minesweeper\" to prevent vibrating colors and to increase the contrast from the background. I also changed the two smaller texts on the top and bottom to a very light blue to give it more contrast. Another critique was the intersection of the red text with the numbers on the background, with this idea and the increase in contrast between the number and background, I decided to remove all numbers behind the title to give it a cleaner look. Sadly,\u00a0 the last critique on the \"ft\" being too close to each other was simply due to font choice with no easy fix due to the way the text was coded, so I kept it the same as before.</p>\n<p>Implementation of this interactive game poster took longer than expected so I wasn't able to polish it more. I would've liked to add audio to it to indicate the cells being revealed/flagged. The absence of showing the user whether they won or lost was also a downside as it was something that audio could've done without imposing on the game poster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T12:53:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a54/a54c5c5f7b2bb6296abc994e41987a4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tai Wen Lee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
