The person creating the room can edit the properties (such as map type, score needed to win, etc.).</p>\n<p>The gameplay is very simple, you use your bombs to try and throw your friends to the lava. Last one standing wins the round.</p><p>This game was made using Unity, and also Photon for the networking components.</p>\n<p>Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T05:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/299dd4b0ca0fc1b9f3912e985330b513.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Azaknora"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
