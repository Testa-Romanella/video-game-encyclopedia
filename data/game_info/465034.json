In this game, a maze is randomly generated around you, and it also changes as you walk though it. The maze is \"Out of Control\".</p>\n<p><strong>(Out of) Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use WASD to move</li><li>Use your mouse to look around.</li><li> Use left click to attack.</li><li>Pick up the donuts (by walking over them) to regain some health.</li><li>Watch out for the scary dudes, they attack at night (after 5 minutes).</li><li>The game does not restart automatically when you die. Just reload the page.</li><li>Use esc to unlock your mouse from the game.</li></ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, we didn't have nearly enough time to finish the game. The bugs and lag also went \"Out of Control\". The first 5 minutes of the game are also rather pointless right now, as this time was intended for preparation for the night, but there was no time to implement any mechanics around this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:20:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ba/9ba08b647265fd8ad3cd0219ee214bd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Stanley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
