Once they had taken over a human they would be able to fire organic weapons a bit like the Goo Gun in Unreal Tournament.</p><p>Getting the arcing shot and turn based stuff working took up a lot of my time, so what I have now is a turn based game where two players can float about and try and take each other out with bouncing shots. </p><p> Turns out there is a lot of maths involved in getting arcing shots and bouncing working well. This week I learned a couple of things.</p><p>1) You need a certain quality level to really test if mechanics work. I had a super hacky implementation of bouncing but if 50% of the time it clips through the wall it's hard to tell if it works or not. A large part of this is just my skill with Game Maker but I definitely feel like it's taking me less time to implement the features I want.</p><p>2) NEW RULE: If I have it in and working to a decent standard I can't touch it. I had two individual player objects and a working turn system. I wanted to set up a player parent object and ended up breaking everything. I wasted a day just getting back to where I was previously. </p><p>Overall i'm quite happy with this one. I actually did a bit of two player play testing and it's the first game-a-week prototype where I thought \"yeah, there could be something fun here\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0fdc7636c06f9d5d5617a5eafb0a8a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HK UdP"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
