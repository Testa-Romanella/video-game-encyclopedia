Some dives may require a bit more work than just battling through the monsters of the deep as you may need solve various unique challenges. After each difficulty mode play-thru it offers an unlock which gives incentive to return to the ocean depths one more time on a higher difficulty setting.<br/><br/>The game offers full controller support with Xbox(360/One), and Dualshock 4 controllers which is the recommended way to play the game.
