So now, the only thing that dis world can depend on is you and your ninja skills.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: this game IS STILL under development so there are currently only\u00a0 2\u00a0levels in it. THE CURRENT LEVELS(TUTORIAL) are full of power ups for u guys to play around but I would also like u guys to try not using them and test the mechanics and leave a review/ suggestions on what should be changed.</p>\n<p>Also: For the final version, many things will be added such as background, VFX and new monsters.</p>\n\n<p>note when playing: make sure that your window's aspect ratio is 16:9</p>\n<p>INSTALL INSTRUCTION: after pressing download, you will get transferred to a mega link and at that point, u can just press download as ZIP and extract it and play.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T03:34:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a5ca6b25b0a11b42df3f4d854c2fc5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["superherolol123"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
