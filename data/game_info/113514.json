We made this game because we love watching scary movies together.</em><br/></p></strong></em><em><p>\r\n\t\tRECOMMENDED SETTINGS: Windowed at 1920 x1080 or below. (We had some issues with list view in the inventory)<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p></em><p>\r\n\tReward money offered for footage of unexplainable activity in a national park. You'll have to explore and make it back to your car safely. Collect fragments from other seekers and the lost footage of those not so lucky. And be careful at night...\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game runs in real time. If you play while it is day, you can collect lost footage and clue fragments. Every night, the forest will reinvent itself. If you want to find all the lost footage, you'll have to come back on multiple nights.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Please feel free to use our itch.io comment board if you have theories and questions!
