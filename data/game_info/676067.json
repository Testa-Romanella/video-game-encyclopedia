Do not forget to create new mixtures to keep everything running smoothly.<br/><br/>Be careful, an inspector will swing by to have a check on your nuclear reactor to make sure that everything is working correctly. Keep him busy and get him to leave as quick as possible so that he doesn't have the time to verify your reactor.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Whatever you do, do not fall asleep on the job!</p>\n\n<p>*Results not guaranteed. We are not liable for any failures to save nuclear reactors while using the Manuala\u2122.
