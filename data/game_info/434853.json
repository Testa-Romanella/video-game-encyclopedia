Will he succeed or will the darkness consume him in the end?</p>\n<p>Last Light is a 2D Platformer which uses the basic\u00a0WASD\u00a0controls (without the S!). Your job is to deliver the light to the end within a time limit. Monsters are attracted to the light and you can hide it using the\u00a0spacebar. Hiding it will deplete your timer at a faster rate.</p>\n<p>The game also has music but you may need to turn up the volume\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n<p>04/21/2020 2:11PM GMT+08</p>\n<ul><li>Bugfix for proper spawning of enemies.</li><li>Bugfix for life display.</li></ul>\n<p>04/21/2020 4:00PM GMT+08</p>\n<ul><li>Bugfix for level 2 monsters targeting you even with the light off</li><li>Bugfix for accidental infinite spawning at level 2</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Programming and Game Design by LykaWolfie</p>\n<p>Music and Art by DemKimos</p>\n<p>Font from\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/nightmare.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:47:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7de2bf2bbcf987cdeff2908007cc67af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LykaWolfie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
