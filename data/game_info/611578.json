Try to find the exit on a simple green path. Follow the red path if you didn't even feel the difficulty of the first path. Well, at the end you will be waiting for a deadly path, where you will suffer from the loss of time spent searching for a way out. It will be interesting. Support the project if you liked it. Then you will see the update soon, you will be able to continue your path of passage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T09:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf4/cf4388eadefb4653e7308f7a2631f582.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["indi creator"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
