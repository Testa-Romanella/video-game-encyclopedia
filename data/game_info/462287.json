I'm a French fan of video games and I  made a small 2D platformer game during my free time to see and understand how a video game is creating.</p>\n<p>I'm not a developer at all, it's my first game, I looked at tutorials to create what I wanted to do. I sadly know there are some bugs (especially with the boss) and I'm really sorry at that but my goal wasn't to produce a perfect game, just a game where you can have some fun and I hope it will work. <br/></p>\n<p> I create it with Unity and made almost everything by myselft except for the\u00a0music.</p>\n<p>Here are the songs if you are interested in :<br/>-Amari\u00e0 - Funky Souls</p>\n<p>-Amari\u00e0 - Lovely Swindler</p>\n<p>-Kings Trailer - Rafael Krux</p>\n\n<p>Tell me if there are some things you didn't like or understand, I would love to have some feedback to understand what I did wrong.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I hope you'll have some fun and thanks for playing it !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T03:53:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b9/5b91b14ba37e089d4e19940e2e592570.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Negapi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
