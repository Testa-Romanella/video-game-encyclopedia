Your controls will change the longer you stay inside the temple, so find your way out quick!<br/>KEYBOARD ONLY. Your movement keys will be displayed in the bottom left corner, and will change over time.\u00a0Once a key is switched, it's lost forever (i.e.: If your W gets cursed, you won't be able to move with it again until you either\u00a0win or die). Pay attention, because you might run out of keys sooner than you think. Dodge the traps, focus your mind and escape Aztecla!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:03:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e49/e49c48a31752f082da96d29d8d43593c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PHD", "lunawitcher", "Deshiro", "Bolsa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
