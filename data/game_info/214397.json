Well, hey, welcome to my freaking world, eh! It's a little something of what I like to call 'hell'. Not to mention, to imagine how victorious those 'Doomsday Preppers' must be feeling! Of course, maybe they didn't make it anyway. Anyway, my rear is still here ... for now ... so good luck trying to find me!<br/><br/>~ A Lone Survivor, Late December 2012<br/><br/>Those were the last found words of someone out there ... Maybe he or she died about that very week of the Doomsday 2012 solar flare apocalypse. Maybe said-person was too smart. God knows ... so-and-so is still on the go.<br/><br/>Question is: How will your journey go?<br/><br/>The controls are simple: you type into your keyboard your choice per each story situation. Some will do good, some will do wrong. You may find your way or you may die.<br/><br/>Eventually, it will end for you ... but first, try surviving the\u00a0<em>Afterdays</em>.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Until converted from Batch, the downloaded .exe file may trigger a false-positive scan with your antivirus.
