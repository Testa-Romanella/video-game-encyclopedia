Climb your way out using the hand controller trigger buttons while overcoming vertigo, arm-burn, obstacle and a few hidden surprises to get your heart thumping and your knees a wobble'n.<br/>In the theme of 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' you find yourself at the bottom of a large temple, you have a pack full of gold and the only way out is up! Not for the faint hearted, if you are scared of heights beware! (actually if you are scared of creepy crawlies, the dark, spooky atmos or life in general then maybe give this one a miss :)<br/></p>\n<p>Temple-K is currently in development as a passion project.
