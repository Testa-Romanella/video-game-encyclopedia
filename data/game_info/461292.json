That is why I implemented a steering wheel dynamic, that will slowly increase/decrease the steering angle depending on the direction you steer. If you do not provide steering input, the steering wheel will return to zero (i.e. straight driving).</li></ul>\n<p>Press Escape (ESC) to delete the vehicle(s)<br/>Press Space (SPACE) to add/reset the vehicle(s)<br/>Use Arrow Keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the vehicle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:57:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a23/a2335924ce8333a3b553fa6a7e15bd3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jSchmalhofer"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
