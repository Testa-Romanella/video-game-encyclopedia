{"id": 413740, "slug": "elementallis", "name": "Elementallis", "name_original": "Elementallis", "description": "<p>Elementallis is a top down ARPG with emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving. The game is inspired by the Zelda games, especially those from the GameBoy. We aim to capture the feeling of the 8 and 16-bit era.</p>\n<p>In the game, you will explore its world and its dungeons, where you will obtain the power of an element in each one of them. These elements will be used to solve puzzles and will also be a core part of the combat.</p>\n<p>This is an early demo with the main mechanics that will be on the final game. Here you can play the first dungeon and obtain the fire element.</p>\n<p>Keyboard is supported but it is\u00a0recommended to use a gamepad.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is being developed by me as a solo developer. Feel free to provide any feedback, I would highly appreciate it.</p><p><strong>You can follow development at\u00a0</strong><strong>@elementallis</strong></p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n\n\r\nContains music \u00a92019 Joshua McLean (mrjoshuamclean.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International<br/>Contains music from Patrick de Arteaga<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T04:35:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c4/3c487ba6d8d016bf813128feeec682ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IvanKae"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
