What if the gods really visited us? what if God is not just a creation of the mind? How would people in ancient times thought of the power of the cosmos?</p>\n<p>A visual experience to absorb through your senses. (I had VR in mind for this, sadly cant afford the equipment to make it, maybe in the future)<br/></p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is not a \"game\" per se, not much of interaction apart from looking with the mouse. It was intended more as a \"digital frame\" experience.<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by the song The Arrival Ritual from the Sphynx album from Melechesch. All rights belong to them. This is intended more as a tribute to such an amazing band. Please support them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T06:20:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20f/20fcc8139ec087941b233e0367f2c958.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rodolink"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
