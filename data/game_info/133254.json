He never told anyone how he became a Supreme Wizard, because, in fact, he made a pact with the Devil to get such power, and always hid his true form. The biggest problem is that he betrayed the Devil and tried to conquer his throne, so he was cursed and banished forever from Hell. Before returning to Earth, he stole an amulet that allows him to free the gates of Hell at Windermere. The only way for him to have enough strength to defeat the Devil is to gather ten Demon Hearts from a Grim Reaper. For this, a prophecy was created, and only after a wizard reaches the last of the Tasks of Supremacy do they appear.</p>\n<p>After completing the first nine of the Ten Tasks, Adacoveus calls Drojemorn to his last challenge. Use the Amulet and collect the Ten Demon Hearts. Drojemorn accepts and the gates of Hell are opened, merging with Windermere, and releasing a horde of demons led by the Grim\u00a0Reapers on Earth.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Jump</strong>\u00a0- Left side of the screen</li><li><strong>Fireball\u00a0</strong>- Right side of the screen</li><li><strong>Double jump (only with the wizard)\u00a0</strong>- Double tap on the\u00a0left side of the screen</li><li><strong>Strong Fireball\u00a0(only with the demon)\u00a0- </strong>Hold the\u00a0right side of the screen</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b17/b17cb8c17cf2e26cfdcebf871724794b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Lucas Schneider Postai"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
