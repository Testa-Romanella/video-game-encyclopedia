A slippery car is perfect for the right angles and getting around landmarks like Columbus Circle.</p>\r\nCompete!\r\n<p>A stopwatch allows you to fine-tune your skills to compare against other players.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy! I made this in hopes of winning the jam to fund my next game :)</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTES**\r\n<ul><li>Part of the jam requirements were that I use GeoPipe's real world map. Unfortunately, there are some weird road issues that sometimes cause your car to get stuck! To fix this I added an\u00a0'unstuck' button that will pop you up and out of most sinkholes. The button is the spacebar.</li><li>Controls are just WASD along with the spacebar for unstuck and tab for quick restart</li><li>No idea why the main menu is off, this is my first time using HTML builds \ud83d\ude05</li></ul>\n<p>Post a screenshot of your best time in the comments and I\u2019ll keep a\u00a0scoreboard :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T14:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b4fb7a2ebe4d5f0ca3e512b6247782c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MagicChickenStudios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
