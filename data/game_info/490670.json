I don't really feel like doing that, so I shall skip to the present.\"<br/><br/>The year is 1935. It all started with a single letter. But from that point on, nothing would remain the same for Angela Bard--a quiet, solitary woman living in the Scottish isles.<br/><br/>Much to her surprise, she receives a mysterious and strangely esoteric reply from an unexpected source...<br/><br/>Who is Devere? And how can he be sending letters from the forest at the edge of Angela's town?<br/><br/>Read through their illustrated correspondence, and watch their story unfold.<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li>Voice acting for the leads.<br/></li><li>Examine an array of letters, postcards, and other documents.<br/></li><li>Multiple endings.<br/></li><li>Open Dyslexic font option.<br/></li><li>Self-voicing and descriptive text toggle.<br/></li><li>Text-to-speech voice mode.</li></ul><h3>Team</h3><br/><ul><li>Katy133 .......
