Click the photo to begin.</p>\n<p>What happens when a small-town lesbian (you) goes home to her divorced parents for the holidays? </p>\n<p>Holiday Hell is a <em>semi</em>-autobiographical game about my life. The game is a real hodgepodge of personal experiences, and all the horrible things my dear friends have told me about their own families, mixed with some fictional stuff that I totally made up. </p>\n<p>In the true spirit of the holidays, this is going to be an emotional rollercoaster. Sometimes you get to make choices, and those choices might matter later. Sometimes the computer will randomly decide something for you. People are out of your control. Your support system will be there when you need it.</p>\n<p>This game will explore situations involving ALCOHOL (social drinking) and MENTAL HEALTH (anxiety/depression). Please reach out if you need more information.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb7/bb7451795a6c96820747324de5a25d3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Orb Witch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
