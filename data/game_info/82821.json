{"id": 82821, "slug": "marble-bump", "name": "Marble Bump", "name_original": "Marble Bump", "description": "Marble Bump is an original new puzzle game. It is quite simple, but it is pretty tough to master. At first it appears simple. Just bump marbles together to shatter them, and once you are down to a single marble, you win. And the initial levels are fairly easy, but the game gets tough quickly, and the highest levels are guaranteed to bend your brain.<br/><br/>The game comes with 24 levels of increasing difficulty. But you're not done when you have mastered all of the included levels. Marble Bump also comes with an infinite number of randomly-generated levels, so you can tease your brain whenever you want.
