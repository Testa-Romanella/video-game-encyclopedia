It's about a minigun who got brought to life by Cthulu\u00a0and now it wants to kill everything. By the way, celestial horrors have families too so you're actually the bad guy. It matches the theme because shooting also moves you. We made almost everything by ourselves except the sound which is listed below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Engine</p>\n<p>Unity 5.6.1 Personal Edition</p>\n\n<p>Licenses</p>\n<p>http://soundbible.com/1804-M4A1-Single.html</p>\n<p>License: Attribution 3.0 | Recorded by Kibblesbob</p>\n<p>http://soundbible.com/1706-Shot-Gun.html</p>\n<p>License: Attribution 3.0 | Recorded by luminalace</p>\n<p>Contributors</p>\n<p>Jason \"Jasonnautilus \" Shang: Most of the Coding<br/></p>\n<p>Kevin \"ekaperiodictable11\" Hu: Art, Sound, the rest of the Coding</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/9345fab6acbd5cd1bf1ee20af0af7d25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ekaperiodictable11"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
