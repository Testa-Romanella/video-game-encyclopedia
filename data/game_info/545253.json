The theme was \"I didn't sign up for this\".</p>\n<p>Made by only 2 people, our interpretation of the theme was to take a very simple task and make it difficult. With a name like \"Simple Shopping\", this would give the players a product they didn't necessarily sign up for.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T04:06:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a2207feb0a79d7dba78cf205d8784cde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew_Ashbaugh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
