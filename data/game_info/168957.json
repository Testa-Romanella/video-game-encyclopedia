To that point several features are missing, most notably is the score HUD and any kind of messaging (though some messages can be viewed via the console).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong></p><p>This is my first Ludum Dare entry (though don't let that keep you from an accurate judging)! I wrote 'Feed Fat Louis' with LibGDX and did the artwork, programming and sound effects solo. I didn't decide to join LD until ~midway through Saturday and did the bulk of the work on Sunday and some extra stuff Monday on my lunch break, and in the final development hour. Inkscape was used for the art, Android Studio was the IDE, Audacity served as the sound recorder/editor.  I can't write music so I experimented with just making scarfing sounds in the major musical scale and then playing one when Louis eats a snack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d74/d7446f0d316fedb433fbfa83e902b773.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["fun++"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
