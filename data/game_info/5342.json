{"id": 5342, "slug": "medal-of-honor", "name": "Medal of Honor", "name_original": "Medal of Honor", "description": "<p>Medal of Honor is a first-person action shooter providing both single and multiplayer experience. It is the thirteenth game in the Medal of Honor franchise, but in comparison to the previous ones, its plot is unique. The game is set in the historical period of the War in Afghanistan. The single campaign opens up in 2001 during the invasion of Afghanistan. The action gives an opportunity to participate in the military conflict for the U.S. Navy. In the course of the storyline, players alternate between the roles of a Navy SEAL operator codenamed Rabbit, Delta Force sniper Deuce, U.S. Army Ranger specialist Dante Adams, and AH-64 Apache gunner Hawk. The gameplay is based on typical military operations including the completion of in-game objectives (raiding enemies\u2019 checkpoints and rescuing hostages). Medal of Honor multiplayer offers a choice of joining one of the conflict\u2019s forces: the Coalition or the Opposing Forces. Each side has its own weapons, however, comparable in general stats. To start a match, the player should choose a class (Rifleman, Special Ops or Sniper). Classes\u2019 equipment and skills can be upgraded with the experience points earned in combat.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2010-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T22:37:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/106/1069e754e7e6012b0cf42b4b04704792.jpg", "website": "http://www.medalofhonor.com/", "rating": 3.26, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 193, "owned": 3410, "beaten": 713, "toplay": 59, "dropped": 198, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 101, "ratings_count": 688, "suggestions_count": 635, "game_series_count": 17, "reviews_count": 691, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts DICE", "Danger Close Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
