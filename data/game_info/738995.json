It's a game in which you control a bird, but there's a catch.. this bird is flying home and there's obstacles... more precisely, pipes! You've gotta go through them in order to make the best score you can.</p>\n<p>Originally, it was only Karl Jump but I lost the game's files and got enough motivation to make it again... from scratch. So I hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>Just like the first version of the game, I will change the game's assets at some point.</p>\n<p>There will also be new gamemodes in the future!</p>\n<p>Download's below, have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T07:38:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e9/2e9584af94574cdcd754ce6fd314924d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["It Is  Coco"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
