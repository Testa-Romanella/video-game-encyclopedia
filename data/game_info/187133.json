It's an upgrade/arcade game where you are under control of a small spaceship trying to mine gold out of meteors, in order to buy upgrades, until one of them obliterate you. During each turn you'll struggle to dodge and destroy the meteors and try to reach the highest score possible. So, game on! Call your friends, challenge them, beat them! Are you going to be the very best, like no one ever was ?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5d2c2c66f0164879654def0a297e38f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vshp11"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
