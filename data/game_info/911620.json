You can only remove tiles surrounded by tiles of the same color. The game ends when there are not any playable tiles. It's always possible to remove all tiles from the board. The score increases when the tiles are removed and rewards moves that remove a lot of tiles at once.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T06:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/925/925c439ace3573320741c433442482b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deus777", "iguene18"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
