The idea is simple. You have 3 gems to choose from, and you need to place them on the board to make 3 in a row. Then if you make 3 in a row, they get removed, along with any bricks beside them. However, if you do not make 3 in a row on any turn, more bricks will be added. The goal is to stop the board from filling up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T11:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a093185068df55f343e45f4913c50ffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PeckyChicken"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
