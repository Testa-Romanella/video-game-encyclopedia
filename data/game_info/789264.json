At around 3-4 years old I suffered frequently from insomnia, sleep paralysis and night terrors. This game encapsulates some of the images I used to see and things I used to hear.</strong></p>\n<p>This is intended\u00a0as more of an visual experience than a playable one. Making this project, along with years of binging horror films has really helped me take control of the fears I thought were long gone.</p>\n<p><strong>Project made entirely in Unity. The modular kit was borrowed from the Unity Asset Store, and creatures were obtained from Sketchfab.\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T20:38:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/900/90002ff7aab060165b31fa122603fe54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wesley Wanjohi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
