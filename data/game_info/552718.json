Prisoners also wear paperbag\u00a0 so the captor is one of us... or just prisoner running through hallucinations? Maybe real captor is coming back soon...? However that paperbag dude doesn't\u00a0like noises and lights and you have to escape from the house without disrupting him. And because you are warm-hearted, of course you'll\u00a0 save\u00a0 fellow prisoners by dragging them to front door so you can all leave the house happily. But front door is locked and you need to find the key. The problem is that key is made from something magical that won't show in light. Instead it glows in dark...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Obectives:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Find the front door key to get out (The key will randomly appear in a different location when a new game starts)</li><li>Drag your fellow prisoners to front door (Hint: pants)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Hints:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Open the doors for more light</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Shift - Run</p>\n<p>C - Crouch</p>\n<p>E - Open Door</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Mouse wheel - Adjust light brigthness</p>\n<p>Left Mouse - Crap and drag</p>\n<p>Right Mouse - Release</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>All 3D-models, programming, music and the most of sound effects made myself.
