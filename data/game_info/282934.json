You play as a vendor inside the machine, making coffee for customers. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile at work you're a slave to Auto Coffee\u2122 but when you go home, that's YOU time! Spend your money however you want. Want a new couch? Get it! Want a sick VR headset and some new games? Get them... Play VR in VR! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you boil this game down it's basically a series of mini games just like most VR games. But I feel as though everyone should enjoy these mini games for FREE!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/027/027ae2c36fe0c9b785631b424799a6e0.jpg", "website": "https://www.lelandcbw.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leland Wilson"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Leland Wilson"], "esrb_rating": null}
