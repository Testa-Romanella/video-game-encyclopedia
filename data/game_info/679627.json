If you fail to do so, ya lose!</p>\n<p>If you can get a good high score, come on down to my discord server, where I'll give you a cool role if you can get a good score!</p>\n<p>Note: This game IS playable on browser, but I\u00a0<em>HIGHLY </em>recommend you play it as a standalone software. Here are a few upsides to doing so:</p>\n<p>~ Ability to resize the window</p>\n<p>~ More fancy shmancy particles</p>\n<p>So what are\u00a0 you waiting for? Go download the thing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T08:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a9/1a98506d2d81f95f0300fdf0f3daae0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ninja ScruffTuna"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
