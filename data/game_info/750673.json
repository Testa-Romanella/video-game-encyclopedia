After Project Reflect, I wanted to keep it simple. I decided to make a puzzle game which I thought was not hard to program. During development, I focused too much on how the game looked, making several iterations and eventually using this totally unecessary fancy lighting engine. Because I was not programming cleanly, the code became an absolute mess, and I quickly lost interest in the project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:32:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ac/0acd5e2a0c641706756a36e35a1bd031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jorandp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
