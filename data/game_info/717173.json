Lean back and enjoy as the Fractals morph.</p>\n<p>All of these are accessible trough the main menu:</p>\n\n\n<p>With Fractal Explorer VR I wanted to give as much control over the Fractals as possible, while also not having overcomplicated menus. To acheive this I created a 3D menu seperated into 3 sections: General, Fractal and Color. This lets the menu be less cluttered. Only one of these sections is presented to the user at a time and the active section can be switched by rotating the menu around your hand.</p>\n<p>One special feature in the Fractal menu is that you can select parameters and change them with your controller's joystick. This makes fine tuning and smooth transitions possible. The selected parameter is highligted in blue:</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Be warned that you still need a beefy GPU to have the Fractals render at 90FPS.\u00a0</strong> I optimised the fractals for my GPU: GTX 1060. Some Fractals run at 90FPS, but most do not. I might implement a rendering improvement in the future, which could bump up performance by a factor of 1.5.<br/></p>\n<p>I also just own an Oculus Rift. Other headsets should be supported, but I sadly have no way of testing that, so feedback with other VR headsets is greatly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T03:09:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b3/2b3d42d2d9af1d60f5205727ab6ed6ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Reduxen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
