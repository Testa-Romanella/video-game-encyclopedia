Get to the fridge and take his lunch, then back to your desk without being seen. Grab the sandwiches on your co-workers desks for more points.</p><p>The Human Resources department are suspicious so they can't catch you away from your desk. You must also get back before 2 o' clock (end of the lunch hour); if you don't, or if you get caught you will be given a warning. Three warnings then you're fired!</p><p><strong>Check out the Ludum Dare #33 page and leave a comment!</strong></p><p><strong>HelloWorl</strong><strong>dStudios.co.uk</strong></p><p><strong>Created by Troy Atkinson &amp; Archie Andrews.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1f/c1f8477d54341d22db534f32529ba03b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HelloWorld Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
