Originally I intended there to be several more weapons and have it so you swapped weapons when you defeated an enemy that held that new weapon, but looking back that was ludicrous. So I hope you enjoy my hastily reconfigured scope into a bullet hell with a couple different laser weapons :)</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W to accelerate, S to decelerate. A and D to turn. R to cycle weapon types, Space to shoot. Q to start the game / restart the game. Survive as long as you can!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T02:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4e/d4ed00b784d7d51e9f4af45745813fe5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bradykin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
