The game has orange and purple platforms , you are an orange ball and therefore you can only walk on orange ones. Every 2-3 seconds, the platforms change their color to the opposite.Therefore, you can not stop , there is a double jump in the game , but it can only be used if you jump from the platform , if the platform falls under you, then you will have only one jump .The level is difficult , I tried to pass 10 minutes . Try to pass for yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T09:19:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99a/99a334a3ef838065839bb27e32ebe59c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["merai"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
