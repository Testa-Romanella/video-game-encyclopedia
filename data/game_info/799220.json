In order to win, you need to eat 10 bugs with your tongue. There are obstacles in your path, though.</p>\n<p>As a cold-blooded lizard, your body temperature is continually decreasing due to the cold desert night. Stand near a campfire to warm yourself up and avoid death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is also a dangerous bird circling above, don't get caught in its shadow or it'll be the end for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and hope you enjoy!
