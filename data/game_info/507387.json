The character of Sun Wukong was particularly interesting for (also because I'm an avid League player), so I wanted to place him and his magical staff in the spotlight. I also went down a little rabbit hole of Chinese folklore and became enthralled with shadow puppetry - a popular form of oral tradition - which became the central theme of the game.\u00a0I think this prototype, on the surface, is pretty straightforward, although I was able to experiment a lot behind the scenes within the code. These experiments resulted in a couple bugs you might notice while playing, but otherwise please enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:26:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc6f023f651ff9c2ab751e1ad8364465.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
