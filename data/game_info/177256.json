Oh well, let's do a dissection:</p><p>I was aiming for a little RPG in gamemaker, Link to the Past-style. It was going to have a neat little story and everything. About a world in a shoebox. Then I ran out of time and I still hadn't figured out why my signposts were working properly in some rooms and not others. Ah, what could've been\u2026</p><p>The fact that anything is being uploaded at all is an absolute miracle. Big thanks to HeartBeast for his tutorial series - they got me from zero to here, which is progress!</p><p>Outstanding bugs/issues:</p><p> - The text in some signs appears above the dialogue box object.  I think it's something to do with my display_scale variable but I don't have the gas to figure it out!</p><p>- Sometimes crashes when attacking an enemy.  Not sure what causes this but is probably related to obj_damage.</p><p>- No 'Game Over' screen.  I JUST RAN OUT OF TIME OK.</p><p>- Controller support is implemented but not tested so...y'know...play at your own risk.</p><p>- No sounds. Again, timings!<br/></p><p>Ah well, I had a lot of fun and learned a bunch about coding in GameMaker. Next time - BETTER SCOPING!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/734/7348a4e2647d2d5d25dd8cc7e0df4c18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Articulated"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
