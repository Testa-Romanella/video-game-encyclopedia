Now it's time to let the zombie horde pay for their unholy existence. The virus has spread throughout the world, but humanity is far from giving up.<br/><br/>Forget about things like complicated controls or hour-long cutscenes \u2014 jump right into the fray and watch the fireworks! It's a game that everyone will enjoy, no matter their gaming experience, as the characters you command aim and shoot on their own. Just drop onto the couch and bask in your endorphin rising from a survivors-like gameplay loop!<br/><br/><br/>Your squad evolves upon your customized decisions as you play. Pursue a varied set of perks and support skills, or focus on your favorite character to alter their gear and gain their ultimate abilities.<br/><br/>Control a lone SWAT soldier or an entire team of badass mercenaries armed with katana, flamethrower and rocket launcher - it's up to you every time you play!<br/><br/><br/>Forge your squad to your liking with permanent upgrades. Decide upon how you'd like to progress and if you change your mind just reset and try something else. Pursue the specialization you enjoy the most and observe how your team becomes death, destroyer of worlds.<br/><br/>Assert your dominance over the enemy by increasing the virus' strength and making the hell's army stronger and faster. And when you finally stand at the top, ascend to a higher state of being with the unique prestige system, proving that you're not afraid of anything.<br/><br/><br/>As a small team of buddies, we make games we enjoy playing and want to share them with you.
