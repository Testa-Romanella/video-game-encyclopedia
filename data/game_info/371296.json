It was made in 5 days (with haste)</p>\n\n<p>'They see' is a platformer, heavily inspired in the game Celeste Classic, for the Pico 8 (Surely it would also be heavily inspired by the main game, but i haven't played it yet, forgive me). In 'They see', you play in a beautiful world, until you find glasses that help you see reality. With these glasses, you can jump from and to this reality with each dash.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Not wanting to make this a speech, i would like to thank all the organizers of the CGJ. This is actually the first game i finish.
