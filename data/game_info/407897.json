It is a short vertical scrolling shoot 'em up with different kinds of enemies and one final boss.</p>\n<p>Take control of <strong>Prota</strong>, the protagonist prototype ship and blast those hearts out of your way with your chilling ice beam while protecting your core, but be careful not to overheat! <strong>The more hearts you bump into, the more you get harmed!</strong> Spikes can lower your maximum health, but might help you see better if you are on fire.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to destroy the heart <strong>Cora</strong>, behind their many layers of defenses, at the end of the level, and put an end to this mindless pursuit. Though what it all ultimately means is up to you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T03:28:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2f31bfed126df3c0d253794c0ee77c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Silva Levy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
