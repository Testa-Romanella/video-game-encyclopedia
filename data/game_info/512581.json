I have dozens of Dead Projects that at most have 2 hours effort put into them, Despite the ideas I might come up with I can never see how it would end\u00a0 up as, or lack the knowledge of how to make them.<br/><br/>So I decided to force myself to make a crappy game under a time limit to at least say I've finished a project and that's what \"Castle Oblivion\" is.<br/>Its short, you be\u00a0lucky if it lasts 10 minutes, No real battles, 2 heavily telegraphed Game overs, something that might pass as comedic dialogue and\u00a0 a highly disappointing ending<br/><br/>Give it a look if your THAT curious but I don't recommend it for anyone actually looking for a game. Its mostly on here to I can give it to people who ask about it.<br/><br/>Bugs:<br/>Due to the way I used switches, loading a save will make all the events respawn but It should never stop progress<br/>Last boss does not have animations for some reason. I don't care though</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:03:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47b/47b72707072563468b0746e01a03201e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FuzzyKey"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
