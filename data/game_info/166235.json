You can walk around using WASD keys and switch planets with the G key. You can break trees and stones and you'll see how much you have in the top left corner of the screen.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please leave a feedback for the game or any suggestions so that I can improve the game and make it better for all of you.</strong></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD Keys to move around</strong></li><li><strong>G key for switch planet</strong></li><li><strong>1 to build a floor, 2 to build a wall and 3 to build a pillar, 4 to build a door frame.</strong></li><li><strong>Press Q to stop building.</strong></li><li><strong>Left click of the mouse to confirm build or to attack.</strong></li><li><strong>Esc to open pause menu.</strong></li></ul>\r\nThings that have been changed or have been added since last version:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Pause menu added.</strong></li><li><strong>Start scene added.</strong></li><li><strong>When you don't have enough materials to build something, so the object will be yellow.</strong></li><li><strong>You can build now a door frame.</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b4/7b4b83f994347ed8ca0c123a30f3b88b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["seanyasno"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
