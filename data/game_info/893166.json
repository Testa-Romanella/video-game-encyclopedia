However they never expected this job would   lead into a journey to save the world.</p>\n\n<p>here's a game i've been working on for some time. this is my first project so i hope you'll find it to your liking.</p>\n<p>as for its title i do want to mention that i'm not yet decided on   what to call it. i chose the words destiny and bond as they relate to   themes that the story will explore but i'm hoping i'll come up with a   better title when it's done.<br/></p>\n\n<p>i also wanna mention that i am looking for people to help me with   this project by making some custom assets for me. i'm especially   looking to recruit an artist to make custom artworks for me,   specifically monsters and backgrounds for the battles.</p>\n<p>another asset i could make use of is music. so if any composers are interested i hope you'll consider it.</p>\n<p>so if anyone\u00a0with these skills or any other skills they wish to  contribute  are interested simply message me.  the full release will be  released commercially and all participants will  receive equal pay. <br/></p>\n\n<p>finally i also wanna mention that i welcome all feedback and criticism. that said, i encourage you to write your criticism in a calm and composed manner. if you write your criticism with words in all cap to imply anger and yelling that may discourage me from addressing the issue you have with this game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T05:36:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ab/6ab7ff61fa489fb7dc3cd0e68f70717b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fidens_Libertas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
