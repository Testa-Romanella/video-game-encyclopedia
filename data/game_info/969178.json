Play as chubby Kittey trying to foil the plan of an evil mastermind in A Game with a Kitty 1, or help the Archchancellor solve the mystery of Princess Daphodil's lost crown in Darkside Adventures.</strong><br/><br/>These two games are retro 2d platformers with a focus on exploration. As you play, you'll learn new moves that'll let you find new places and treasures, even in previously visited levels. Run &amp; hat-glide with Kittey in A Game with a Kitty 1 or wall-run with the Archchancellor in Darkside Adventures. Numerous bosses are waiting to be challenged, too!<br/><br/>What are you waiting for? Grab these moneybags and thoroughly kick some (evil) koala butt!<br/><br/>And, hey -- as a special bonus, I've also added Treasure Hunter Man 1 to the collection.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Retro pixel graphics at a VERY low resolution<br/></li><li>Two 2d platformers in one package<br/></li><li>Partially non-linear gameplay structure with light metroidvania touches<br/></li><li>Kinda hard (sorry)<br/></li><li>Saving &amp; level selection maps<br/></li><li>Gain new skills as you progress through these 2 adventures<br/></li><li>Ending variations in Darkside Adventures<br/></li><li>A Game with a Kitty is relatively short (1-2 hours), but Darkside Adventures can take you much longer to complete<br/></li><li>Completely free (you can support me by buying my other games if you like)<br/></li><li>Amazing soundtrack by Sean Cameron (thank you)</li></ul><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/><br/>In both games, hitting Backspace or double-clicking will activate windowed mode.
