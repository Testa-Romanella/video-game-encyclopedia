{"id": 675461, "slug": "magmanimal-island", "name": "Magmanimal Island", "name_original": "Magmanimal Island", "description": "<p><em>Fullscreen recommended</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>Wonderful news: You have been chosen by the mighty volcano to rule this idyllic little island!\r\n</p>\n<p>Please listen carefully now, because you certainly won't want to disappoint our volcano.</p>\n<p><strong>On the island, four communities live in a fragile harmony:</strong></p>\n<p>The brokers are resonsible for the wealth of our small realm. If they refuse to work, we will all go bankrupt!</p>\n<p>The musicians play the soundtrack to our island life. Better make sure they don't get out of tune!</p>\n<p>The builders keep the ground nice and level so we can walk around the island with peace of mind.</p>\n<p>The meteorologists know everything about the weather. They keep our island from being flooded by stormy rain showers.</p>\n<p>You are the new ruler over this island for the next two years, but to make decisions, you need the support of your people. This support comes in the form of cards.</p>\n<p>Your deck consists of one card for each citizen currently living on the island.</p>\n<p>To pick up a citizen and assign them a new position, you have to discard a card of the corresponding color.</p>\n<p>From time to time, residents will want to speak with you about various concerns (you can tell by the exclamation mark above their heads). Don't keep them waiting, they won't like that!</p>\n<p><strong>You respond to their request by playing a card. Each card has one of three symbols:</strong></p>\n<p>Accept the request</p>\n<p>Decline the request</p>\n<p>Delay the request</p>\n<p>Accepting or declining a request has certain consequences that will be shown to you beforehand. If you delay a request, there will be no consequences for now.</p>\n<p>Without cards in your hand, you <strong>cannot </strong>respond to any requests.</p>\n<p>Based on your actions, members of the four communities may arrive on the island or leave it, which in turn affects the selection of cards in your deck. Keep in mind that the numerically largest faction is also the most influential.</p>\n<p>But don't worry: You don't have to do this responsible job alone! Add any inhabitant to your advisor cabinet by placing them on one of the empty advisor spots. Each job position grants certain bonuses, and the communities will love it when you put your trust in one of them. Needless to say, they also hate it when you decide to fire one of them!</p>\n<p>Now you know everything you need to know in order to become an admired and successful ruler. Keep everyone happy, and you'll keep our volcano happy! If things should get hot and smoky once in a while, a <em>living sacrifice</em> might help... but I'm sure you won't let it come to that.</p>\n<p>Good luck for the next <strong>two years</strong>. Let's hope you make it that long</p>\n<p><strong>Team</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Battlerager: Code &amp; Music &amp; Writing &amp; Design</p>\n<p>Future Labs Unlimited: Code &amp; Design &amp; Writing\r\n</p>\n<p>Lazymoth: Art\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T09:12:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/798/798cdd9e0cfde497c249c0a96b17babe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Battlerager", "Future Labs Unlimited"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
