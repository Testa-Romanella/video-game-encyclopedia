Each dwarf has a special trait and your common goal is to get deeper and deeper. Obviously, deeper is where more gold is. Dwarves like more gold, duh. \r\nAfter all, if it weren't of the gold, you wouldn't see the dwarves outside of the tavern.\u00a0Don't forget to follow the dwarf's drinking regimen regularly.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the end, we wish that no dwarf under your command will run out of energy. Although it is said that dwarf funerals are wonderful - and every person should see one.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Use mouse to control the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Mouse scrool wheel, W,S or UP,DOWN to move camera.</p>\n<p>- Click dwarfes or their respective panels to target them</p>\n<p>- Command the dwarves by clicking on the icons on their panels</p>\n<p>- Dig for gold. The deeper you dig, the more gold you get.</p>\n<p>- Spend the gold on mine upgrades (Let's you dig deeper to earn more gold)</p>\n<p>- Don't let dwarves die by draining their energy! Send them to tavern or let them rest (sleep).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Each dwarf has specific trait<br/></p>\n<p>Good sleeper means he regenerates energy quickly while sleeping, furthemore you don't have to send him to tavern to be effective.<br/></p>\n<p>Good runner is faster than other dwarves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good digger is more efficient while digging for gold.</p>\n<p>Good builder builds mine upgrades faster.</p>\n<p><strong>When in deeper levels, use arrow keys or W,S to move camera. It's faster.</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Ludum Dare 48 backstory:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The best LDJ we have participated in so far. We decided to skip energy drinks, eat regularly and most importantly - sleep. We enjoyed the weekend way more and were less stressed. We think good sleep was the thing we lacked in the previous jams. Additionally, we have found a new passion in pixel art.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This time we participated in a team of two and our \u201cVery first patron\u201d joined us and helped us with the sound effects. We would like to thank him once again and invite him to participate in the next LD with us again!\r\n</p>\n<p>Fun fact: \"Trposhi\" is spinoff of czech word \"Trpo\u0161i\", which roughly translates to\u00a0\"Dwarves\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T18:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00d/00db6a63c138b5db8b248bb08d553cbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["quietmuffin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
