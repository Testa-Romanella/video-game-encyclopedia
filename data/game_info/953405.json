Also, at one point in The Collection, things start to flicker a bit. \u00a0Also, at one point in time, something happens that ultimately ties in with The Forest. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Forest has an interactive story, as well as other elements and hidden messages. \u00a0How do the video game and story tie together? \u00a0What happens in regards to the creature? \u00a0You'll have to play to find out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T14:47:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcc/dccd1d468c7f40abeeaaadd73dab190b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Danielle's games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
