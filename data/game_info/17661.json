It is mainly focused on the developers that are using the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK and a Senz3D depth camera. The camera is required to play the title.</p>\n<p>The game features no plot whatsoever as it was developed as testing grounds for Intel&#39;s technology.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The core gameplay is the same as in the vanilla Portal 2 game. The players pass testing chambers using an Aperture Science Portal Device. This device creates two portals: blue and orange, which can be passed through by the players freely. The Portal Gun can also lift objects with its integrated gravity module.</p>\n<p>The objective of the player is to reach the exit of the testing chamber by solving an environmental puzzle. For example, the door must be opened with a button that is triggered by a heavy crate. The players have to reach the crate first and somehow get in on the button for the door to open. </p>\n<p>With each level, the difficulty of the environmental puzzles rises a bit with the addition of new elements and the increasing size of the chambers.</p>\n<p>There are seven maps present in this map pack, specifically made for the use of the Senz3D camera.</p>\n<h3>Sixense technology</h3>\n<p>Sixense is a technology, that is developed by Intel. It allows the players to interact with the in-game objects using a special depth and gesture camera that is communicating with the game through a special API.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T09:05:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/1029c3f73786499a8ebaba437a78ed13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.2, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 56, "owned": 1351, "beaten": 19, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 14, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 92, "suggestions_count": 499, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 92, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sixense"], "esrb_rating": null}
