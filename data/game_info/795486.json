You'll need to gather herbs to create potions, gather materials such as wood, stone, and iron, and build crafting stations. You'll be able to build bases with incredible medieval assets (Wood for now, but we have plans!). As you gather herbs and mushrooms, you may find seeds, ready for the complete and integrated farming system.<br/><br/>There's no leveling, so you'll need to craft to survive the world. It's fairly chill, but bosses will be added later, and you do have to watch out for the wolves... and a few other things. <br/><br/>Interact with unexpected NPCs, and hunt wild animals for rare components. Sell your goods to a village trader, and buy unusual things.<br/><br/>Whether you prefer cute villages, spooky swamps, or brushy alder groves full of natural resources, you'll find something to your taste.  As you explore, you'll find that most of the world is covered in grasslands or fantastic pine forests, but several areas have been finished with hand placed assets and detailed resources.<br/><br/>Please note that this game is in the early stages of development. It is completely playable, but only three sections have been completely added to the main map. There's plenty of stuff in the works, stay tuned for all the exciting updates!<br/><br/>Explore! Build! Farm! Conquer!<br/><br/>Looking forward to your feedback and enjoyment of The Otherwilde.<br/><br/>NOTE: Prices will increase with each significant update/upgrade to game content.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T05:26:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf4/cf4f57a31d49cc2468d1bd0541d0c464.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brass Persimmon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Brass Persimmon"], "esrb_rating": null}
