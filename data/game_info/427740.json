Get ready to challenge nature, incredible dangers, serious enemies, and most importantly - yourself.<br />\nMAN STANDING is a survival game in an open, endless world. The player will have to shoulder the heavy burden of the only surviving person in the world who, in a fit of schizophrenic delirium, walks to places that hold memories of untimely people who left this world. But everything is not so simple - in this dangerous journey evil enemies and anomalies will interfere with you. But you will not let them get in your way!<br />\nWaiting for you:<br />\nNext gen graphics on the most advanced engine of our time<br />\nDeep philosophical plot, understandable not only to everyone<br />\nSearch for your own memories<br />\nExciting battles with representatives of the local fauna<br />\nIn-game social interaction, you can leave messages to other players<br />\nOver forty hours of intense immersive addictive gameplay<br />\nIt may seem that the game borrows many mechanics from another game - we, of course, are talking about Hevy Reyn. But do not rush to judge! Hevy Reyn has a completely different story - there was a detective maniac (sorry for the spoiler!) And the main character was looking for his children. And there it was necessary to pass all kinds of tests and all that. But we do not have such tests, and there are no maniacs either! And we don\u2019t have qte either. And we have a completely different setting - in Hevy Reyn it\u2019s not a post apocalypse, but we have a post apocalypse (when the world is after the apocalypse!) !. Do you remember the moment in Hevy Reyn when you had to drive in an oncoming car to find your son (Sean)? So there you go! We do not have this moment either! Therefore, please do not say that this game is similar to Hevy Reyn - this is not at all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-19T18:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c5c370ba2b2e5715732f8122c24a4cd.jpg", "website": "http://manstanding.tilda.ws/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rocketship", "ALFINA GAMERS"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ALFINA WORLD GAME PUBLISHING"], "esrb_rating": null}
