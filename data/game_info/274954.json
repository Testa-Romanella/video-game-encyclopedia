It gives you fun facts too - but that\u2019s for the liberals. <br/><br/>--<br/>Is this real?<br/><br/>As real as your parents' relationship. Unless they\u2019ve already divorced, in which case, yes, this is real. <br/><br/>--<br/>What does it do?<br/><br/>Nothing really important. You walk and run. We track that activity and say messed up things to you. <br/><br/>--<br/>How am I supposed to feel about this?<br/><br/>I don\u2019t know? I\u2019m supposed to tell you how to feel now? Like, Jesus Christ. Why are you even still talking to me and not downloading the app? It\u2019s free AF. What\u2019s the hold up?<br/><br/>--<br/>How mean can the app get?<br/><br/>Pretty mean. But no worries fragile snowflake, we also have a setting that gives you fun trivia for the week. <br/><br/>--<br/>Is there some sort of deeper meaning or purpose to the app?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>--<br/>Basically, we\u2019re like every other fitness app. We\u2019re just not as peppy. I get working out is supposed to make you happy but Jesus, lay off the motivation already. It\u2019s just walking. <br/><br/>Run or walk - it doesn't matter. Walk Against Humanity really doesn\u2019t care how you do it. Just get up and move. We have GPS tracking to see where you went and to show you that your life has purpose.

Earn badges for something you normally do.  <br/><br/>- Track your walking and running for whatever reason<br/>- Customize goals, then miss them <br/>- Share your walks and runs for motivation  <br/>- Compete on the Leaderboard to give your life purpose <br/>- Earn offensive badges for walking<br/><br/>--<br/>We are using the HealthKit to access your health data, specifically the number of steps you take.<br/><br/>--<br/>This app may use your location even when it isn\u2019t open, which can decrease device battery life.<br/><br/>Walk Against Humanity comes with two teams for you to choose to walk for: Against Humanity or For Humanity.
