{"id": 475802, "slug": "capsules-escape", "name": "Capsule's escape", "name_original": "Capsule's escape", "description": "<p>You are trapped in the maze, and the goal is to escape out of the maze, there is no other mechanics and hints for simple levels but for tricky ones you have (springboard, x-ray, map of the level). As long as you are out of the maze you can explore the world or press 'n' to load a new level.</p>\n<p>Its a short 6 level game demo, full game would be developed in case of popularity of this demo. I can not take money for test product but if you are interested in, please donate so I could develop full game. For full game I have plans such as more levels, different mechanics, multiplayer and so on. So I hope we can enjoy a full game.</p>\n<p>Escape, Explore, Have fun.</p>\n<p>P.S. Please discuss and share ideas about this demo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T05:09:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af9/af93740effcea2fca75509adab4f03c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jolboldu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
