Canons will shoot at you and for whatever reason someone has left useful weapons in treasure chests scattered across the scene. They are locked but the keys are floating around in the air somewhere near. If it only wasn't for the spikes and the lava on the ground. Oh, and you're looking for a huge shiny gemstone of course.</strong></p>\n<p>This is my first finished game after fiddling around with GameMaker and Unity for 2 years.</p>\n<p>I made this in 4 weeks inspired by this video by Code Monkey:</p>\n<p>There's a good chance of me coming back to this project after a while and expanding on it. In the meantime I will probably try out other stuff like a\u00a0top-down GTA 2-like game or a simple 3D\u00a0PS1 style adventure.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little game.<br/></p>\n<p>----------------</p>\n<p>Programming, Pixel Art, Sound Design, Intro &amp; Ending Music: Henning Behrendt<br/>Sound Design: Maurizio Bergmann<br/>Ingame Music: Sergey Gdanian<br/>Software used: Aseprite, Cubase, FMOD, Logic, Pro Tools, Unity, Visual Studio<br/>Color Palette used: https://lospec.com/palette-list/sheltzy32</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:39:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c56/c5643f157ea0285aba7fc25152017d74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Talk Like a Beluga"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
