{"id": 649053, "slug": "sneaky-kitten-2", "name": "Sneaky Kitten", "name_original": "Sneaky Kitten", "description": "Sneaky Kitten is a family-friendly non-violence game, where you play as a cat to collect coins and other trinkets. Do this by solving problems and sneaking past some non-friendly dogs.<h3>Play as a cat!</h3>Have fun playing as a cat! Experience the excitement of being a fluffy cat who can run and jump around in fun levels. The goal of the game is to sneak around the enemies (that are dogs) and steal their treasures.<h3>Exciting stealth gameplay</h3>Dogs are patrolling the area around the treasures. To steal them you have to be very sneaky to pass the dogs, finding paths where the dogs can't spot you and sometimes distract them from their original path, then quickly sneak past them before they come back to spot you.<h3>Non-Violence</h3>We know that most family-friendly games today include violence. Our philosophy at Eight Lives is to avoid violence, which is why we have made Sneaky Kitten without violence.<h3>Problem solving</h3>Sneaky Kitten is a game with tricky problems to solve and situations to get out of.<h3>Collectibles</h3>Throughout the game there will be trinkets you can steal from the dogs, unrelated to the main mission. Steal all the collectables and you might get a reward!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T02:35:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8d/c8d39ef066fa7b6152f9dd6b144419d5.jpg", "website": "https://eightlives.se/sneaky-kitten/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eight Lives"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Eight Lives"], "esrb_rating": null}
