{"id": 10602, "slug": "dino-d-day", "name": "Dino D-Day", "name_original": "Dino D-Day", "description": "<p>Dino D-Day is based on a completely absurd premise: what if Adolf Hitler used battle dinosaurs in his conquest of Europe, and what if they were actually effective against XX century weapons? Of course, such a setting can not be taken seriously, so the game is full of humor and Jurassic Park references.</p>\n<p>The game is oriented towards online multiplayer gameplay. The players have to pick one of two teams, Allies or Axis. Both teams can compete in a traditional frag-counting deathmatch mode, a &quot;king of the hill&quot; mode, or complete specific objectives to win. Each side has multiple character classes, but most dino classes are on the Axis side, including such spectacular specimens as fast-ambushing Velociraptor, machine-gunning Tyrannosaurus and a Triceratops with a mounted tank turret. While dinosaurs are technically stronger than humans, they have trouble reloading their firearms and can be distracted by an Allied rabbit released on the battlefield. Still, the sides are not perfectly balanced, and battles can often become chaotic.</p>", "metacritic": 53, "released": "2011-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-20T13:02:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/7115f17fd8453b9d4d93536446247404.jpg", "website": "http://www.dinodday.com/", "rating": 2.4, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 100, "owned": 2760, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 130, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 77, "ratings_count": 210, "suggestions_count": 566, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 210, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["800 North and Digital Ranch"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["800 North and Digital Ranch"], "esrb_rating": null}
