Explore the office, meet the boss, and see where it all began.</p>\n<p>This game was made by me in a little over a week. With the sole purpose of alleviating some of the heartbreak that myself and many others felt when we found out that Coco was graduating from Hololive. It serves as a permanent reminder of the impact she has had on all of us. As well as something to look back on and share our hopes for whatever the next chapter holds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'd like to give thanks to MMMaellon who created the meme this game was based on. SPOILERS:\u00a0https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/nyan6m/secret_ame_coco_lore/</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out this game. I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T08:36:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c66b1eddfa931986a8976f5d3a06047.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Classyham"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
