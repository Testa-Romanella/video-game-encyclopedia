No rules, no objective, no timer\u2014just a living canvas in a peaceful environment.</p>\n<p>How to play: stand near the edge of your VR space, facing inwards, and run the game. The palette floating in front of you lets you choose colors to paint with; it also has a button to\u00a0reset the scene if you\u2019d like to start over.</p>\n<p>I have only tested <em>Blossom</em> on fairly high-end hardware\u2014a Valve\u00a0Index and a GTX 2080\u2014so it may not perform well on some computers. For that, I apologize: making VR games both pretty and performant is really, really hard.</p>\n<p><em>Blossom</em> is\u00a0for the 2020 Unreal Spring Jam, and took about five days to make; I worked on my own, with the following tools:</p>\n<ul><li>Unreal Engine (of course)</li><li>Houdini</li><li>Substance Designer</li><li>GarageBand for iOS</li><li>Cinema 4D</li><li>Voice Memos on iOS</li><li>Audacity</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:31:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/677d4d7125ddec8feaa0b88ae9b60b87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
