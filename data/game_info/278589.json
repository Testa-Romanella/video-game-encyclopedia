I can only assume it was a misprint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game was well received by Crash magazine earning a \"Crash Smash\" (a score of 91%).\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Gareth Pitchford for providing these scan,\u00a0 and well done Linda, on your Crash Smash!Important Release Notes - Mobile Platforms</p>\r\nMobile\r\n<p>The 20th Anniversary Edition was designed to provide a good experience across a range of form factors, HOWEVER:</p>\r\nItch.io Wrapper Bug\u00a0(Forced Landscape Mode)\r\n<p>Itch.IO appears to have a bug that forces HTML5 games into landscape orientation. This bug is being looked at by the Itch support team and should hopefully be resolved soon.</p>\r\nIf playing on Android:\r\n<ul><li>Make sure you are running\u00a0Chrome 71 or above, which incorporates a required fullscreen mode bugfix.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nIf playing on iPhone:\r\n<p>The Beast utilizes an engine (Adventuron) that uses a HTML Input widget in the browser, but iOS has a \"feature\" whereby an additional bar above the soft keyboard is shown if an input widget is on the page.</p>\n<p>The casual observer may perceive this as a browser\u00a0bug. but officially it's a \"feature\"/</p>\n<p>This may be acceptable on \"tall\" iPhones, such as iPhone X, but on an iPhone SE, it makes the game borderline unplayable unfortunately.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>A solution may be forthcoming, and if anyone has an iPhone, please send in screenshots of any rendering issues you may encounter.</p>\r\nBug Reports\r\n<p>If you have any bug reports, please let me know either through the\u00a0@adventur_on Twitter page.</p>\r\nFuture Enhancements\r\n<p>This game will receive a number of enhancements as the game engine accrues new features.\u00a0</p>\r\nSocial Media Links\r\n<ul><li>@adventur_on -&gt;\u00a0Adventuron's Twitter Page</li><li>@ainslec -&gt;\u00a0Chris Ainsley's Twitter Page</li><li>Adventuron's Facebook Group</li></ul>\r\nOriginal Version Screenshots\r\n<p>Here are some screenshots from the original 1988 version of the beast, just out of interest.</p>\n\r\nOriginal ZX Version Screen (1) - NOTE: This screen not in 30th Anniversary Edition<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOriginal ZX Spectrum Version (2)<br/><br/>\n\r\nOriginal ZX Version (3)\r\nRecommended Reading\r\n<p>If you don't know much about the UK-based text-adventure / IF scene of the 1980s/90s, I recommend reading:</p>\n<ul><li>Classic Adventurer, by Mark Hardisty, a superb limited run set of magazines with interviews from various figures from the history (and renaissance) of (primarily) the UK text adventure game community.\u00a0 Mark is a superb writer, an even better interviewer, and these magazines are beautiful and enthralling in equal measure. Four issues have been released, and there is rumour of a fifth.\u00a0Do <em>also</em> check out Mark's page of links related to 8-bit text adventures.</li><li>Twilight Inventory, by Gareth Pitchford. Gareth is an exceptionally talented, generous, and prolific individual. His book focuses on the home-made adventure game scene games made in the late 80s through to the late 90s. In the Twilight years, hence the book title. His book is available (for a limited time)\u00a0as a free PDF document, or you can order a physical copy from the link above.\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>THE SPECTRUM OF ADVENTURE, by Thomas A. Christie. Thomas' book is a huge tome that features 100 reviews of classic games on ZX Spectrum, but unlike Gareth's, tends to focus on adventures before and during the twilight period.</li><li>For more information on PAW, see this superb article by Stefan Vogt, on PAW, and its place in the history of the UK Text Adventure scene.</li></ul>\r\nAlso....\r\n<ul><li>Although not 100% dedicated to adventures,\u00a0do also check out Shaun McClure's books on ZX Spectrum Game reviews, which includes quite a lot of text adventure reviews, and\u00a0Stuart Williams' adventure game segments in Crash Issues 99, and 100, and the ZZap 2018 annual. Shaun will be releasing a book on Adventure games in 2019 I'm informed.</li></ul>\r\nThe 2007 Inform Port\r\n<p>A port of the Beast was made to the Inform system (also with permission) made back in 2007, by Steve Haddon.\u00a0Find out more about that version\u00a0here.\u00a0</p>\r\nWhere Are The\u00a0Ambient Sound Effects?\r\n<p>This edition of the Beast\u00a0\u00a0was originally intended to ship with sound effects, and ambient sound, and a YouTube video was posted a few months ago\u00a0with the sound wired up in the early part of the game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it was not possible to complete the work on the sound version, so the initial version shipped will ship without sound effects or ambient sound.</p>\n<p>It is possible however for this to be resolved in a later update as the engine fully supports music, incidental sound effects, and ambient sound.</p>\r\nLegal Information\r\n<p>This version of the beast should not be downloaded, modified, or\u00a0redistributed anywhere else.</p>\n<p>The original version of the\u00a0Beast's copyright belongs to Linda Doughty, and Linda has kindly granted permission to use \"The Beast\" intellectual property for the purposes of creating and distributing this 30th anniversary edition.<br/></p>\r\nVersion History\r\nVersion 1.0.0 - Initial Release, 19th December, 2018.\r\n<p>The initial version of the game.</p>\r\nVersion 1.0.1 - Minor Update, 20th December, 2018.\r\n<p>Some vocabulary updates, and typo fixes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f57c9167115fc56310b98948db5978ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adventuron"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
