Gameplay involves navigating through a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors, and eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to complete the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies.</p>\n<p>While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have an overhead view, and include difficult block-moving puzzles that can fatally trap a player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-05T02:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/451/451e4180ef00c865456e4add265311b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Beam Software", "Krome Studios Melbourne"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Data East"], "esrb_rating": null}
