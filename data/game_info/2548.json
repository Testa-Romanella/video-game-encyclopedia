Now Shantae must form an unexpected alliance with her past rival to stop Pirate Master. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Regarding gameplay, Shantae and the Pirate\u2019s Curse shares many similarities with previous games in the series. It is a 2D side-scroller that is not divided into several levels but rather takes place in one interconnected world. The game mostly consists of fighting enemies, solving puzzles, platforming sections, interacting with different NPC that can give you quests or sell useful items. Since Shantae abandoned her genie powers, in this game you do not use magic abilities, instead of throughout the game you collect different pirate items such as a pistol, a pirate hat, pirate boots, scimitar, and cannon. Each of them gives player new abilities that help in combat, puzzle solving or open previously closed areas of the game world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-21T22:36:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5a/a5a8e5820043aa1285643f3d243e5664.jpg", "website": "https://wayforward.com/games/shantae-and-the-pirates-curse/", "rating": 3.84, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 132, "owned": 1822, "beaten": 105, "toplay": 46, "dropped": 43, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 169, "ratings_count": 157, "suggestions_count": 406, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 159, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "Nintendo 3DS", "Wii U", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["WayForward Technologies"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["WayForward", "Wayforward Technologies"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
