You cannot be harmed, even when falling at the edge of this world. So enjoy hopping around the highest mountains!</p>\n<p>The game features several procedural generated contents (terrain, scenery, treasure locations) and was submitted to PROCJAM2018.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa0a63e91a46aa19b41f3ad335082ca1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andreas Angourakis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
