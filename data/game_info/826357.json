Thanks in advance.\r\n<br/></p>\n\r\nContent\r\n<p>The demo contains a part of the very first zone to explore \u201cThe Green Forest\u201d, with different creatures to fight against and a Mini-Boss. This will guarantee you at least 1 hour of gameplay. Hope you will enjoy the adventure! <br/></p>\n\n\n\n\r\nFuture Updates\r\n<p>There will be great changes in the game, especially concerning the environmental art, I 'm already in contact with some great Freelancers to make the best version of the game as fast as possible, but before I begin this step, it would be very helpful to have some first reviews from you, players.\r\n<br/></p>\n\r\n\r\nFollow the work\r\n<p>Follow me on Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/heroodyssey<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\r\n\r\nControls\r\nController (X-Input)\r\n\r\n<p>Attack : X\r\n</p>\n<p>Jump : A\r\n</p>\n<p>Heal : B\r\n</p>\n<p>Map : Y\r\n</p>\n<p>Inventory : RB\r\n</p>\n<p>Pause : Start<br/></p>\n\n\r\nKeyboard\r\n<p>Move : Directional Keys</p>\n<p>Sword Attack : S\r\n</p>\n<p>Jump : Space\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Heal : H\r\n</p>\n<p>Inventory : I\r\n</p>\n<p>Map : M\r\n</p>\n<p>Pause : Escape\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T11:59:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14a/14a904670de28097c64367c2f5500832.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sentori Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
