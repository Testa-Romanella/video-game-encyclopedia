Avoid touching the slimes, they can be very enthusiastic for your Aroha. Every time you share your Aroha with 5 slimes, you randomly get one life back or a special Aroha sprinkler which lasts for 3 seconds! As you spread your Aroha, more slimes will come looking for you so be prepared for more slimes the longer you play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T08:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f9/3f977efcf2d2c9e9a5f4ee1cef54092e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["65827"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
