After completing an assignment in which I had to create a Point class whose objects could be assigned coordinates, I realized I could use this concept to make a simplified version of a certain popular strategy game that will remain unnamed for my legal safety.\u00a0This game is\u00a0pretty simple, but I learned a lot from making it and I am proud of how it turned out.
