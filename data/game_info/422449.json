{"id": 422449, "slug": "marble-muse-arcade-edition", "name": "Marble Muse Arcade Edition", "name_original": "Marble Muse Arcade Edition", "description": "<p>Marble Muse Arcade Edition was made to help promote the Champlain Games Festival. It is a physics based game, where you tilt the environment using gravity to navigate a marble through increasingly mind bending courses. It is meant to be played in an arcade cabinet and supports cabinet controls and RGB lightup controls. In a retro arcade style, you complete each level before the time runs out and go for the high score!</p>\n<p>Notes: <br/></p>\n<p>The default controls are wacky because they are set to work with the Ultimarc I-PAC Ultimate I/O Control Interface. You can adjust them in the config dialog that pops up before the game starts.<br/></p>\n<p>The marble_muse_ae_preferences.save file that contains useful settings such as volume settings and FreePlay (on by default) is located in the Marble Muse Arcade Edition_Data folder.<br/></p>\n<p>If you want the full experience with the RGB light up arcade controls, there is an LEDBlinky folder with the config files you need to set that up. Install LEDBlinky (https://www.ledblinky.net/Download.htm) and merge the config files in. You\u00a0 will also need to edit the the marble_muse_ae_preferences.save file and set the LEDBlinky exe location.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T04:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/061/06187857b852812e0bd0ee323ca4a649.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ketos Games"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
