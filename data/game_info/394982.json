Conquer level after level using your skills and wit, but beware! Only the most skilled will prevail and get through in one piece. Once you have entered, there is no going back. Will you stay strong and keep going, even after countless defeats, to reach the top and claim your reward, or will you give up and perish like the rest.<br/></p>\n<p>Endless Tower is a puzzle platformer with a twist on the regular platformer formula. You play as a warrior in his journey to conquer the tower using only your sword to bounce off walls and defeat enemies in your way. Fourteen levels stand between you and the top, each level getting more difficult than the previous one.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n\r\nhttps://forms.gle/D8mSJmWHC2sA7AJR6\r\n\r\nReport a bug\r\nhttps://forms.gle/WwvaQksgDYa5xmAh8\r\n\r\nOfficial website\r\n\r\nhttps://www.codexcreations.net/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T04:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/753/753dcc810400b060611baf28646a44bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Codex Creations"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
