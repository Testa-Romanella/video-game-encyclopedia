After a tragic battle against the terrible pirates of the Black Cloud Gang, you lost your ship and took one from the pirates to continue your mission. Unfortunately, this ship is based on a really old technology as it can only do one action at a time: shoot, go up or go down. You have to choose that action first and then use it.</p>\n<p>The Corporation has sent reinforcements who should arrive at any moment now,\u00a0but be cautious, you're in an area full of asteroids!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You are the red ship and your job is to protect blue civil ships from\u00a0asteroids.\r\n</li><li>Asteroids will come from the right side of the screen and will move in a straight line toward civil ships. Over time, the interval between two asteroids will be reduced and their speed will increase.</li><li>Your bosses told you that up to two civil ships destroyed is an acceptable lost. But be aware that when a third ship will be destroyed,\u00a0your mission will be failed.</li><li>Try to stay alive as long as possible, until reinforcements come !</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Even if this\u00a0is a Web-based game, it is also possible to play it on Mobile (landscape only).\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Choose current action</strong>Mouse Left Click / Touch (both on right side of the screen)<strong>Use current action</strong>Space / Touch (on left side of the screen)\r\n<p><strong>This game has been made in 3 hours for Trijam 165 (theme: one action at a time) by Nicolas.</strong></p>\r\nAll assets have been made by me during this Jam, except:\r\n<p><strong>Fonts:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Space by Ibram Syah :\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/space-3.font\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Musics:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Space Boss Battle Theme by Matthew Pablo:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/space-boss-battle-theme\r\n</li><li>Space Station by AVGVSTA:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/space-station-0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>63 Digital sound effects (lasers, phasers, space etc.) by Kenney:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/63-digital-sound-effects-lasers-phasers-space-etc\r\n</li><li>Blasteroids SFX Pack by Rodeo:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/blasteroids-sfx-pack</li><li>Light Switch on SFX Sound Effect by Nicole Marie T: https://opengameart.org/content/light-switch-on-sfx-sound-effect</li></ul>\n<p><em>Made with Construct-3</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T12:47:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa9/aa9268a0de72999635c89854f642b784.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shibaya"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
