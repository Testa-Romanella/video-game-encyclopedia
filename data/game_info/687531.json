Why? well because why not use data to generate stages, it will give unique playability every time you play. The data will also determine when and where enemies are spawned on the map.<br/><br/>You will have three 30 minute charts to choose from; 6 hour, 12 hour and 24 hour time frames. The difficulty selected will determine how many enemies are placed in the stage. It can get pretty chaotic in the crypto verse.<br/><br/>The goal is to hold the highest Flypto score? So what you waiting for....get your Crypto Flip on!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T05:29:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b38/b389be3aebdff90ff67ca6890128048d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BitTwisted"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
