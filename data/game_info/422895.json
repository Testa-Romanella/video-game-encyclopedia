The goal of the game is to catch notes and avoid asteroids to fly for as long as possible.<br/>The spaceship moves up and down according to your singing pitch. To go up or down the spaceship, you should sing a note higher or lower. Sing the note you hear to catch it. <br/>The game can recognize the note sung, spoken, whistled or even shouted.
