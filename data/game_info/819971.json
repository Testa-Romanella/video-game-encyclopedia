Collect dice and launch them at enemies for chaotic fun!<br/></p><p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - throw Die</p>\n\n<p>Roll for Damage was designed around the GMTK 2022 theme of \"Roll of the Dice\"</p>\n<p>Firstly thank you so much for playing this game and I would love any feedback or tips! This was my first ever game jam I was able to solo develop a game and submit it on time for! I really enjoyed this theme and regardless of how well I do I 100% intend to continue working on this concept by adding a few more mechanics and variations to the dice and creating art that was designed for the game and not modified from a tileset.</p>\n<p>The idea was to have a Bullet Hell game where the player actively rolls a die to gain abilities while progressing through the dungeon. One of the abilities was the dice would spawn a pattern of bullets. While testing I found that to be a really fun mechanic (in my opinion) and started to experiment with it more. This led me to have the player throw the die and not get any abilities but instead simply spawn a bullet pattern.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I was playing with the player having essentially this dice grenade and wasn't even using the pistol I had equipped because it was more fun to throw the die to get kills. So I made a bullet hell game where the player doesn't have a gun and instead can run around causing chaos by rolling their die for damage!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also I added in the Dice Forge to customize the faces of the die but ran out of time to make all the customizations I wanted to create a wide variety of die. I will be working on it and ricocheting.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dice Animation:\u00a0Dice Roll by Kicked-in-Teeth (itch.io)</p>\n<p>Dungeon Tileset:\u00a0Fantasy RPG - Caves and Dungeons by Snodekfeld (itch.io)</p>\n<p>Player Character: Character Base: Thicc 'N' Juicy by DanVelasquezArt (itch.io)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T21:37:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b01/b01daaf780fba8d19ed3ae9e4bcc89ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mattpaw"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
