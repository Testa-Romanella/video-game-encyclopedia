Simply hit the arrows and gain points! Got an Xbox360 controller? Plug it in and it'll work too! See if you can beat all three levels! Happy Jammin'!</p><p>This game was made during the GBJam and was inspired by games like Dance Dance Revolution and Project Diva. The game itself was created from scratch with DirectX9, Photoshop, and a mobile music making app. Due to the nature of DirectX, the game will only run on windows platforms. <br/></p><p>If you experience any problems getting the game to run please contact me via the comment section or email at: alexanderman2004@yahoo.com.</p><p>You can also contact me through my website at kenny-designs.com.<br/></p><p>Good news! The game's code is now up on GitHub! Check it out here. Make changes to your hearts content and I'll even update it! Have fun :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b41/b4115f12db33f44c4cdbaa2135e72da1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kenny-designs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
