The second player just has to enter the IP address to join and click ready.\r\n</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a demo scene where we can evaluate the performances of 500 boats BOIDS wandering around. Those boats are simpler than the one in other levels and are optimized to work in this particular scene.\u00a0 \r\n</p><p>--<br/></p>\r\nResources\r\n<p>-\u00a0[Boats and buildings]</p>\n<p>-\u00a0[Animations (tween)]</p>\n<p>-\u00a0[Water Shader]</p>\n<p>-\u00a0[Cleaning]</p>\n<p>-\u00a0[Particles]</p>\n<p>-\u00a0[Trees and other decorations]</p>\n<p>-\u00a0[FPS counter]</p>\n<p>-\u00a0[Network]</p>\n<p>-\u00a0[Cursor]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T03:28:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f98/f98295a9da29cc10d8120779ea1bc15c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Malorke"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
