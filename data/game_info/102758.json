This short project ended up becoming a full plotline to a game that I might well go on to make, complete with pseudo-first-person exploration of the virtual AR-GUS prison, evidence gathering, more involved gameplay, more characters, and of course, continuation of the story covered in this 'intro' segment. For the moment, the game is mostly handled through dialogue, has only a couple of characters, and features only a taste of what the full game might be.<br/></p>\n<p>At the end there'll be an option to participate in my research: this is entirely anonymous, and would really help me out!</p>\n<p>The current release is v.0.26 for Windows only, and should be mostly stable. However, I've only had limited chance to bugtest so there may yet be problems with the game! If you come across a bug, please screenshot it if possible, and provide as much detail as you can in the discussion thread for the game. Please be patient as it's likely to be buggy for a few days while I iron out any problems (I'm not good at programming, lol).</p>\n<p>If for some reason you go mad and feel like donating to this poor chump for whatever reason, it'd help support my future development efforts!<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you find it vaguely interesting!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dde/dde8f318590ec9a341f78c2a919da860.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
