Election Manager comes with a variety of scenarios, from a recreation of the 2012 election to a four-way election between independent parties. In addition, almost any imaginable two-to-four way election scenario can be designed by the player.<br/><br/>The Election Manager 2016 engine uses actual historical and demographic data to produce reasonable election results, taking into account factors such as partisan lean and voter elasticity. The player will not only have to consider states but also media markets, giving the game a strategic dimension due the inefficient mapping from one to the other. For instance, to target New Jersey's 14 electoral votes, the player would have to spend money on ads in the Philadelphia or New York City markets \u2014 but significant portions of those markets are actually in other states. So is it really worth spending that money there, or would it be better spent going after other states instead?<br/><br/>While Election Manager aims to give you complete control of your strategy, it also comes with tools to help you manage it \u2014 up to and including an AI campaign manager to which you can delegate any part (or all) of your strategy, from campaign stops to ad buys to state offices to polling.
