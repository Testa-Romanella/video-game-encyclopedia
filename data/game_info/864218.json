Of course it's just a short joke poking fun at how expensive the production of the movie was at the time, but this fake game itself with its gigantic Kevin Costner character on the screen who takes a single step before the machine asks for more quarters always made me so eager to know 'what would be beyond that one screen you see in the show...'</p>\n<p>This project was born from that interest, and while originally planned to only be a short game, it quickly developed further and I sunk tremendous amounts of effort into it to the point where it ended up becoming a fully fleshed out game of much greater scope than I ever expected. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to discuss the game with fellow fans join my Discord community by clicking here<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Created by Macaw45</strong><br/>Twitch | Twitter | itch<br/><br/><strong>Promotional poster art by Jiggeh</strong><br/>Twitch | Twitter | Website<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-10T07:57:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/343/343377ef53d8b26675875579f276b32c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Macaw45"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
