Now you can use those same devious strategies to conquer your rivals in this addicting simulation of 14th Century political life.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\"A prudent ruler must not honor his word when it places him at a disadvantage.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on the multiple award-winning game Merchant Prince, Machiavelli the Prince allows you to rule the world and acquire cast wealth and power. You'll trade exotic goods with over 40 cities. You'll manipulate political and religious institutions using bribery, slander, and assassination. You'll field mercenary armies capable of crushing your enemy on medieval battlefields. And you'll experience it all through brand-new graphics.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\"A wise prince should rely on what he controls, not on what he cannot control.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay on a historical map, or in a randomly generated world. Face off against the sophisticated artificial intelligence of computer players. In Machiavelli the Prince, winning is a matter of strength, shrewdness, and clever deception.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:42:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96d/96d305752417d1371e6b14d12c751e0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 335, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Holistic Design"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["MicroProse", "Ziggurat Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
