Help Elizabeth the Wizard Vampire Kobold (a lot huh!!) in her adventure through Stompo Grove, smack around Stompos and collect tomatoes in order to be invited to a Harvesting season feast!! This is a large adventure where you get to chat with various fellas, learn a bunch about the world of Stompos, look out for secrets and just have fun in general!! Includes in-game achievements!!!!</p>\n<p>This has been crazy to make!! I'll make a post on Newgrounds about making this and post it here too!!</p>\n<p>There is an extra song \"persevere\" by\u00a0@skydev\u00a0who let me use it, you can have it replace the main soundtrack that I've written once you find the Newgrounds Record Player, because turns out writing music is super-hard, and my OST will drive you crazy quickly probably!! All of the sounds are royalty-free, either edited to fit the game or put in as they are!\r\n</p>\n<p>What's coming: hopefully a working game in case this one is broken (again, shouldn't be at all!), a post detailing the development process of this game (made all by myself!!) aimed at folks who also would like to try making a game... Bug fixing if anything!! Improving this version, if need be! I think that's it!!!!\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks a bunch to all of my friends who helped me test and optimize this game, to\u00a0@Stepford\u00a0for being supportive and telling me how to work the Medals script (sorry!!), to Tom Fulp for being a rad individual, to makers of MAD SISTERS WEEK OFF for inspiring me to make my own game too!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T04:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c9cf4699595eaf8394add4e4e6bde69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Roksim"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
