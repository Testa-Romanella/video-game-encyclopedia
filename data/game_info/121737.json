To do so, he sets out to do what anybody might expect of a hunting god: lead what few followers he has left to lands inhabited by the most legendary of beasts and defeat them to claim their treasures. Along the way, he must convert travelers to bolster his house and prove himself a worthy god after all.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<strong>WASD</strong>move<strong>Space</strong>jump<strong>Left click</strong>attack / fire (only when followers are on back)<strong>Right click</strong>\u00a0<em>(hold</em>)aim<strong>Q</strong>toggle followers on back<strong>F</strong>special (unique to current form)<strong>Number keys</strong>transform (when available)\r\nAbout the Project\r\n<p>This prototype was a project for a college class that was pitched by me (@steakfish) then developed with the help of a team (listed below). A\u00a0GDD for <em>Catalyst</em> exists, however it's unlikely that it\u00a0will continue forward in its current state\u00a0with the same team. Maybe in the future elements of it will come through in another game.</p>\n<p>Note that this is very short and unstructured as\u00a0most of the work went into making the GDD. The\u00a0goal here was to make something that was aesthetically pleasing.\u00a0Also, it was made on high-end systems to run on other high-end systems -\u00a0sorry if it lags out for you.</p>\n<p><strong>GOD DEER</strong> (the team):<br/>Marina Pimentel<br/>Jenny Luu<br/>Jesse Toyota<br/>Joshua Bresler</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc1/fc1afb2a190b47fa2b678003f26384ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
