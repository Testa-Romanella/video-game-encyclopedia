Worked on allocating tasks and did some programming and concept art. Worked on finding music and did most of the UI.<br/>Myself - I created some of the artwork, all of the in-game assets, bug testing, some debug coding and created the in-game audio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T08:11:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f0/6f0ec25d4d5b684e08886c1e98c67575.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TwistdRabbit"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
