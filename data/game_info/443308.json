It was intended to be a hyper-realistic simulation of a ball that \"bounces\" around to squish people, which is why I spent a lot of time adding small little details like bouncing off of surfaces. <br/></p>\n<p>When I first published this to YoYoGames, one comment in particular said something along the lines of, \"This is probably the worst game on this site.\"<br/></p>\n<p>Defeat the Bosses!</p>\n<p><strong>Mersatan:</strong> Half-Satan, half-mermaid. He shoots a fireball at you. It does no damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Boss Fight #2: </strong>Unnamed colossal beast with two arms that will destroy you in one hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Dragon: </strong>A giant, mighty dragon who is terrorizing humans. Poses no threat to you, but must be stopped at all costs. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>When on the red screen, press <strong>Escape</strong>.
