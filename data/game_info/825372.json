{"id": 825372, "slug": "cheaphaven", "name": "Cheaphaven", "name_original": "Cheaphaven", "description": "Welcome to Cheaphaven, your best bet at escaping the outside world by diving into the relaxing world of agriculture.<br/><br/><h3>Take an hour or two off</h3>Spend some time fishing, pet a chicken, build a windmill, enjoy the small things in life. Cheaphaven features a brief respite full of farming, building and upgrading, a small town of NPCs for all your chatting and shopping needs, and vaguely humorous descriptions for everyday items. Day/night cycle, market values, sales reputation, a pigeon, all the things that are supposed to be in a farming game<h3>Demo limitations</h3>The demo allows you to play for a full in-game week without restrictions. You can keep playing after the demo time ends, but progression won't be possible. Demo save data can be transferred to the full release<h3>Real talk</h3>Cheaphaven is a hobbyist solo project, and was made to be \"completable\", so you're probably not going to get 2000 hours of fun out of it, but if you're looking for eight or so hours of relaxed escapism, you're in the right place.
