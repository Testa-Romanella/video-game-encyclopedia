I tried make game in the past, but always the project was too big and I lose motivation to finish them. So I decited to make small and simple game.</p>\n<p>My first idea was to make a game clone of \"hyper olympic\". After entire day of working I just thought how much I played the orginal one. Me and my friends played that game maybe once per month, and there was maybe 30mins session in this game. It's always make fast bored. So I remove the project and start think about new idea again.</p>\n<p>I was recently playing \"Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy\" and finally finished the game in 8.5 hours. So I thought that inspiration is perfect. I wanted to make others suffer.</p>\n<p>In my game \"Rage Climbing\" you control the hands of a guy who climbs a mountain. You control the lower left side of the screen with your left hand, the lower right side of the screen with your right hand. When your hand grabs the stone you must keep holding the screen, if you release the screen the hand will release the stone. There are several obstacles to keep you from getting bored.</p>\n<p>Try to beat my record which is 37m 13s.</p>\n<p>----- In Game:</p>\n<p>Music: Dull - Lofi by Migfux20 from opengameart.org<br/>Music: Simple Piece of Music by Pheonton from opengameart.org</p>\n<p>Sounds Effects from Pixabay.com</p>\n<p>Graphics uses images by:<br/>- upklyak<br/>- pikisuperstar<br/>- valadzionak_volha<br/>- brgfx<br/>- macrovector<br/>- pch.vector<br/>on Freepik.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T14:08:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/460/460a324db93c8c193c1d7ade3f00b899.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VanJohn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
