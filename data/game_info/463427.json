Food, a home, protection, hidden treasures... ancestral powers... LAUGH AT DEATH?!... Nothing a 10-years old girl can't handle.</p>\n<p>While exploring the lost forest, you will face stuff ranging from a cherry (Yes, you will fight fruits) all the way to fire spirits. But don't worry, this trees are magical so they won't burn. Every enemy that you encounter have a chance to drop items that will help you progress throughout your journey.\u00a0 Did I mention you have some alchemical powers yet? No? Well you do, and you my friend, can combine every drop you get between them, have you tried combining I don't know, a bottle of water with fire? You think it is impossible? Well that's because alchemists have kept that secret! But don't pay attention to me, I'm just a voice in your head...
