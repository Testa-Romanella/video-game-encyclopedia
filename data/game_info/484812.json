Join our discord to speak directly to the devs, share your ideas and join our weekly play sessions: <strong>https://discord.gg/fracturedveil</strong><h3>Survive 2120 Lahaina</h3><br/>Restored from incomplete data found in a recently discovered Veilcorp back-up system, players find themselves in a future Hawaii ravaged by the fracture and the effects of time. Players must search for food, water, and shelter in order to survive. Dangers include animals, mutants, other players, and lingering environmental effects.<h3>Crafting and Building</h3><br/>The harvesting and crafting systems provide players access to equipment, gear, and upgradeable weapons, including many traditional Hawaiian weapons. The construction system allows players to build bases for protection using 4 different materials thatch, wood, stone, or metal.<h3>Open World</h3>Procedural building, road, and river systems offer players unique worlds and settings to explore as well as places for mutants and other dangers to lurk. A dynamic weather system and day/night cycles highlight a map based on the existing roads and topographical data of West Maui.<h3>Co-op Play and Autonomous Drones</h3>Group together to explore, share resources, engage powerful opponents, and rebuild the world that once was. Powered by machine learning, autonomous drones patrol the map streaming gameplay. Focusing on a variety of actions and filming in standard, night-vision, spotlight, and thermal modes, these cameras offer players and spectators alike a unique view of the game in real-time.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Cloud-based AI<br/></li><li>In-game drones powered by machine learning<br/></li><li>Alternate realities for players to travel between<br/></li><li>Dynamic weather system<br/></li><li>Day/Night Cycles<br/></li><li>Procedural building, road, and river systems<br/></li><li>Large scale NPC intelligence<br/></li><li>Crafting and quests<br/></li><li>Fight players, mutants, cannibals and animals to survive<br/></li><li>Open world featuring 64 square kilometer map</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T18:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb3/fb33619776b836bd80152a9de26d4d2f.jpg", "website": "https://fracturedveil.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 546, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paddle Creek Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Paddle Creek Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
