This is also my first 3D game in Unity. It was a lot of work, and I'm extremely happy with the results.<br/></p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>My level takes place in the present day, in an underground dungeon. You have been kidnapped, and you don\u2019t remember who you are. Your captor is Sully Mottz, better known as \u201cSilly.\u201d He was the main star of a hit children's TV program, \u201cSilly\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d But the show has been canceled, and his life spiraled out of control. Silly blames you for ruining his life, and wants revenge!<br/></p>\n<p>You must use Sully's Match Gun to clear obstacles and reach the exit. The gun allows the user to destroy groups consisting of at least three identical and adjacent objects.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Programming + Level Design + Modeling + Texturing + Lighting\u00a0 + Writing</strong></p>\n<p>Kevin Fischer</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Effects</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Ciara Cipponeri</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p><strong>\"Waking Up\"</strong></p>\n<p>Jonathon Sprague</p>\n<p><strong>\"Abierto\"</strong></p>\n<p>Tommy Guerrero</p>\r\nVoice Acting\r\n<p><strong>Sully Mottz</strong></p>\n<p>Ryan Boyer Taylor<br/></p>\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\n<p>Mirjana Nikolic, Tep Sathya Khieu, Daylen Rickert, and Matt Bardley<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T05:39:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc7/fc73cc14782840129271bfa5a6b1b81f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phischermen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
