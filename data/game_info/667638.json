{"id": 667638, "slug": "pumpkin-clicker-theflyingfinn", "name": "Pumpkin Clicker (TheFlyingFinn)", "name_original": "Pumpkin Clicker (TheFlyingFinn)", "description": "<p>The game is very simple.</p>\n<p>You are a pumpkin, and your goal is to\u00a0\"eat\" all of the coins that will appear.\u00a0 A single coin gives you 10 * Multiplier points ( If your multiplier is 2, it will give you 20 points).\u00a0 You can buy upgrades for your multiplier. Each mushroom costs 10 points and it will increment the multiplier by 0.1 . A chestnut tree ,instead , costs 70 points but will boost your multiplier by 1.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But, there is a catch. You will have to eat all coins before they become too many. If the amount of coins not grabbed is 5 or more you lose! That's simple , isn't it? No, it isn't! The game at the begging will be slow-paced, but\u00a0 the more your score grows, the more coins will be spawned. It will be in your interest to spend those coins.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, be aware that mines will kill you and end the game.</p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n<p>(Maximum pace is after 5000 points)</p>\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\u00a0 How to move\u00a0 &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;\r\n<p>Use arrow keys or WASD.</p>\r\n&gt;\u00a0&gt;\u00a0&gt;\u00a0&gt;\u00a0&gt;\u00a0&gt;\u00a0&gt;\u00a0&gt;\u00a0&gt;\u00a0&gt;\u00a0\u00a0TIPS &lt;\u00a0&lt;\u00a0&lt;\u00a0&lt;\u00a0&lt;\u00a0&lt;\u00a0&lt;\u00a0&lt;\u00a0&lt;\u00a0&lt;\r\n<p>To use all of your points in 1 click hold lshift.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To buy more upgrades in consecution hold the left mouse button.</p>\r\nATTENTION!\r\n<p>The game is still under development.
