Know the coping mechanisms. Understand\u00a0the different phases\u00a0of\u00a0grief. <br/></p>\n<p>The game narratives are in French. It has been developed using the Segment2 editor, developed by Raphael Marczak. The art (except minor assets) and music are not from me but from libraries. I think you can tell !\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This serious game was developed during a game jam hosted by Arkham Studio on Discord, May 4 and 5, 2020, during the Online Gamification Event. The OGE was about gamification across all industries.</p>\n<p>My game has been developed under special circumstances. I could not dedicate 2 days for this, as I have a day-time job and a 2 year-old daughter to take care during the Covid-19 crisis. Therefore, I worked on my project by night, for about 14 hours total on the 48 hours allocated. Because of the odd hours, and because I was not sure what I could deliver under these circumstances, I decided to go solo. I did not get a lot of sleep during this game jam ! If I had more time, I sure could have improved the game design, feedbacks, and overall complexity of the game. I really enjoyed this experience (it is my 1st game jam and 2nd game made ever from beginning to end) because of the friendly atmosphere between organizers and participants. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:34:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/966/966bca8886e2d2747a4034b011aa1e9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bmasselin"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
