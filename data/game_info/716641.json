{"id": 716641, "slug": "darkest-ritual", "name": "Darkest Ritual", "name_original": "Darkest Ritual", "description": "<p><strong>Description:<br/></strong>Darkest ritual is a real-time strategy game, where an unexperienced necromancer wants to save his fiancee from death by performing a Dark\u00a0Ritual. For casting spell he needs to collect 3 ancient relics, scattered somewhere in ancient castle controlled by Church, and bring them to Rune Tree. Knights will hunt him down, Mages will try to steal and seal relics and the Love of his life will die soon. He only can finish it with help from you and his subordinates - skeletons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>WASD - camera move</li><li>LMB - Select unit</li><li>RMB - move to point/attack enemy with selected unit</li><li>Q - quick select all units</li><li>E - give selected skeletons \"Rage\" order</li><li>R - give selected skeletons \"Defend\" order</li><li>F - quick attack with everyone except Necromancer.</li><li>G - quick attack with everyone</li><li>Space - quick select Necromancer and move camera to him</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Hints:</strong><br/>Skeletons are dumb - they can be directly controlled only in short range of Necromancer`s sight. When they are in no sight of him - they either can rage (roam the map and attack everyone) or be set to\u00a0defend (guard area). Under direct control they are slowly decaying.<br/></p>\n<p>You need to find 3 relics in chests across the map in given amount of time and bring them to Rune Tree. Chests also may contain useful bonuses. You lose if Necromancer dies or you run out of time.</p>\n<p>Enemies are powerful - don`t fight alone -\u00a0overwhelm them with skeletons.<br/></p>\n<p>Skeletons can be revived from piles of dead - scattered across the map.<br/><br/><strong>P.S.</strong><br/>This is a learning project, so it is quite unfinished, buggy and controversary. Any piece of\u00a0advice and comment is appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T07:23:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc7c9f41fa419cffa722a562b459eee4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Radiant_Lich"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
