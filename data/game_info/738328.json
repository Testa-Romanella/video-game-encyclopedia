The 'READ ME' file is for debugging purposes, not for regular gameplay. <br/></p><p>This game is about achieving the highest score possible, by creating, feeding and defending a settlement. Your settlement is inhabited by Meeples. For Meeples to survive you must give them orders to build, craft and harvest crops. You will fend off against Anteeples. These are the opposite of Meeples, instead of surviving they wish to kill and end your settlement. Luckily there is a boundary between their worlds. To fit the theme of duality, for every action you do has an equal or greater consequence. Each tree you crop, seed you plant and rock you mine generates 'Karma' throughout the world. Karma acts as a link between both worlds, the stronger the link, the better ability the Anteeples have to slip through and end your settlement. One tip: Don't exploit the world too much! Score is calculated by the amount of alive Meeples and the average world karma. Controls: WASD - Move Camera, Left Mouse Click - Select Buttons / Move Meeples.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T04:34:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/289/2890cd8eaddba44ed65c128fd045133a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BaileyLark"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
