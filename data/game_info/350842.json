Prepare for Intense Dogfights with Lasers and Missile Swarms. Hunt your foes across vast landscapes.  Then let loose with vicious barrages of cannon-fire, railguns, missile rain and more.<br/><br/>Power is health, but it is also your ammunition.  In addition, the more you fly and the more you shoot, the more Heat you generate and easier it will be for your opponent to find you and get weapons-lock.  If you can find your opponent first, you may get a crucial first strike and a fast kill.  But if you don't, prepare for intense, fast-paced, and often lengthy ground and areal duels where split second decisions count. Use your Exo-Armor subsystems for offense and defense.<br/><br/>Website -https://exocorpsgame.com/<br/>Discord - https://discord.gg/KuPCF8t<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In the year 2040, an international team has come together to create a new brand of conflict doctrine for the future. Virtual and live-fire exercises, hardware trials and tactics evaluations are held in top secret installations around the globe and beyond. As esoteric and dangerous technologies are combined by top engineering and scientific minds, applicants are recruited from peacekeeping services around the world in order to train, test and define a new paradigm of warfare. If you want to work with the best, and want to play a part in defining the future, you too can apply to be a part of the first pan-human enforcement branch; the ExoCorps.<br/><br/>Gameplay is tuned towards a hide-and-seek experience, with intense firefights where players are countering each other by switching weapons and tactics on the fly.  Your primary weapon is the Multirifle, one gun with six firing modes.  In addition, your Exo-Armor can launch swarms of missiles at your enemy once you achieve lock.  Use missiles to drive your opponent out of the sky.  Use your Autocannon to bombard them on the ground. Use your Minigun to spray them at close range, or your Laser or Railgun to snipe them at a distance. Use your Plasma Rifle for the highest damage-per-second (if you're feeling accurate).  Counter Missile Swarms by launching Flares, keep your Heat low to avoid enemy lock-on, use your Jammer to further avoid detection.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a5/5a521f935c5e923b0ca1318567da66ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 401, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gingerbred"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Gingerbred"], "esrb_rating": null}
