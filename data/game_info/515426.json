The theme of the jam was\u00a0<strong>It's not you. It's me.</strong></p>\n<p>We chose to create a game that revolved around using magnets to move a ball around a maze. We thought magnets loosely related to the theme because they can repel and attract. The game was created in\u00a0C# Unity\u00a0and we finished it with multiple functioning levels, a main menu and a credits screen.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<ul><li>Design<ul><li>Mateusz Solle</li><li>Christopher Selleck</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Art<ul><li>Alexander Murphy (alexmurphy3darts.artstation.com/)</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Programming<ul><li>David Flintoft (davidfdev.com)</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T03:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb2bc47fc68cad62fe4e659322aa5894.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David F Dev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
