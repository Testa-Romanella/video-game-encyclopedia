{"id": 735638, "slug": "color-block", "name": "Color Block", "name_original": "Color Block", "description": "<p>Simple game, based upon guitar hero, where the objective of the player is to block the colors that are not equal to the bar standing below. The player\u00a0will want to match the color every time, giving them 2 points, while matching the wrong color will make the player lose 1 point, with only 1 minute on the clock.</p>\n<p>In order to play, choose the level of difficulty with your mouse and use the arrow buttons in order to move the blocks standing below the arrow signs, and block the undesired colors:</p>\n<p>How To Play: Use ARROW Buttons.</p>\n<p>I will be honest, not happy with how the game turned out, but due to the lack of time during this week, I was not able to produce the best concept &amp; prototype. Despite that, I\u00a0hope it can give a slightly good experience for the ones that play the game. I'm happy, at least, that I committed myself in delivering something.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T06:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/938d157aaabdba9df26379ce00d39bf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Moxtas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
