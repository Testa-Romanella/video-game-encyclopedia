{"id": 63423, "slug": "faria-spiritbird", "name": "FARIA: Spiritbird", "name_original": "FARIA: Spiritbird", "description": "In FARIA: Spiritbird you step into the role of Item-Seeker Eveline Spiritbird, as you hone your abilities, collect swathes of loot, traverse dazzling geography and forge friendships in the pursuit of a mythical artifact known only as an \"Aural Mirror\". With a complex, multi-layered storyline featuring a wide array of characters, FARIA: Spiritbird is sure to thrill and delight you in your journey throughout the Kingdom of Faria and The World.<br/><br/><br/><br/>. An open-world to tackle, explore and invest your time in; one that is filled to the brim with secrets, danger and love.<br/><br/><br/><br/>. Fulfill your role as an Item-Seeker, hunting down relics and items for clients that visit your establishment in Port Faria.<br/><br/>. Make your voice heard! ALL of Eveline Spiritbird's dialogue is chosen by you, the player.<br/><br/>. Want a new look? There are over seventy unique character customization combinations. Do you want a new hairstyle to go with your newly-purchased outfit? You got it!<br/><br/><br/><br/>. Is your house lonely? Romance certain NPCs to have them move-in with you, providing a range of benefits.<br/><br/>. Want a new seaside residence? As you travel, it is possible to purchase a number of new homes to operate from.<br/><br/><br/><br/>. Fancied yourself an angler? Buy a fishing rod, some bait and get out there! From babbling brooks to azure seas, you can catch up to twenty-six unique varieties of fish!<br/><br/>. Have you got a green thumb? There are plenty of berry bushes out across The World that await your prickled hands. You can eat or formulate jam with them!<br/><br/>. You are always able to retreat to your Party Camp for respite; a place where you may heal, fast travel to town or simply chat with your party members.<br/><br/>. Delve through a wide variety of dungeons that range from forgotten fortresses whose age-withered bricks are lost to moss and overgrowth, burrows consumed by the dead, and temple labyrinths created in honour of the star-soaring Evermore! There are loads.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>. An enthralling combat system that is as deep as it is simple to grasp. With almost fifty monsters, each with their own unique skillset and item drops, battles are always as exhilarating as they are a pure joy to engage and watch unfold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>. As you level-up and earn coin, you can return to town and purchase new armour and weapons to kit out your party. Always put some money aside to purchase a healthy reserve of Healing Herbs, Focus Herbs, Remedial Moss and Arch Gems! Be prepared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>. Are you a night-Akita? At home you can sleep until the nighttime and explore Port Faria after dark. Certain establishments only open after hours, and places such as the Passing Bird Inn become far livelier. Outside, on the moonlit cobbles can be found a host of unique NPCs, too.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>. The game is fully-3D and as a result, you can play from a first-person perspective or a third-person one. Change is only a button-press away.<br/><br/>. The game has full controller support and even displays the correct button prompts.<br/><br/>. The primary storyline has no world-saving antics. It is a deeply personal story that takes its characters on a grand journey, within and without themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>. There is a library called the Loreforge that connects to the Brewed Awakening cafe that holds at least twenty-five lorebooks for you to peruse. Their contents range from lengthy tales of heroic deeds to detailed descriptions of races or geographical locations. If you feel well-versed enough in the lore, feel free to take on a Pan-Pan in a quiz gameshow.<br/><br/>. There are real-life time-dictated events. The amount will expand in the future but for now, you can visit the Giving Grove once a real-life day to smash three barrels that deposit a randomized item for you to take with you. The drops you can receive range from a bundle of potions to wild single-use spellbooks. From Dreadwind Flasks to Zapwater Urns, from Pouches of the Wasted to Satchels of Errants, or from Evermore Tea to a vial of Tears for the Fallen; the loot pool is massive!<br/><br/><br/><br/>. There are relics to collect. They can be found in all sorts of places, and they provide nuggets of lore. In the future, a museum of sorts will be added for their placement.<br/><br/>. Your main party is composed of four classes. Eveline Spiritbird is a Paladin; Hawk Starlight is a Knight; Raine Meadowlark is an Archer and Amber Farfaith is an Aid Mage.<br/><br/>. Faria and The World is mostly a good place, free from roving bandits and political corruption. The Farian are loyal to themselves and adversity stems from the wild creatures of the kingdom and the Voidborn. The latter include vile orcs, vicious saurians, twisted demons, sickly trolls an many more. The universe is deeper than one may expect, as it straddles the line between high-fantasy and sci-fi the further you go.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/458/458850a90be17ccf8832d074ee0a49cd.jpg", "website": "http://www.faria.online/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lightspyre Tales"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lightspyre Tales"], "esrb_rating": null}
