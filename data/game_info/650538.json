It doesn't quite fit any of the optional themes, but I\u00a0could make the case for \"Gravity Is the Enemy\"; if you're not careful, the gold hook will slingshot your quarry out into space. More like, \"Gravity is the double-edged sword.\" Close enough.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p><p>Note: You may experience some audio distortion if playing in Chrome.
