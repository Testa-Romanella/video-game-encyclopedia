It includes 64 different puzzles spread across five different puzzle types. You can play a casual game of 'try to clear as many pegs as possible' or a devious game of 'try to draw a picture'. There are even 'Ninja Solitaire' games that you play in reverse to throw a wrench into your pattern-seeking brain. Pegopolis was a hit desktop game back in the 1990's, and now it is back and better than ever!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/8304aea3e14219585dc1bad38b295f40_qCpMTbp.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["The Code Zone"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["The Code Zone"], "esrb_rating": null}
