Fly the dangerous corridors of quantum space to collide and unleash your atomic fury to gain enough energy to break your twin free!</p>\n<p>- Wait for particles to turn green to break them and gain their energy. Use triangle power form to break other particles (key: T / pad: triangle)</p>\n<p>- Slow down time to get set yourself up for a clean break by shifting to your hex power form (key: H / pad: square)</p>\n<p>- Your energy degrades over time</p>\n<p>- You'll need to reach 100 energy to break your twin's prison, once you do you you will be ENERGIZED and will have a short time to find the twin atom before you'll need more energy!<br/><br/>- Controls: (best played with controller)</p>\n<p>Use T (triangle on PS4) to break green particles</p>\n<p>Use H (square on PS4) to shift to time-shift form and slow down time!</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys (left joystick) to move.</p>\n\n<p>A game made by C\u00e9sar R.
