Either the downloadable or the web-playing pieces are only the digital part of the game. It's still playable, but you might feel difficult or confused sometimes. The only tip I can give to you is: don't feel fear to walk into total darkness. (And maybe another one: the character won't stop the walking motion even if it's touching a wall.)</p>\n<p>A version for Mac and for browser may be uploaded later.</p>\n<p>***For the \"button\" mentioned in-game, you can use the left mouse as an alternative key. And that's the only need for using a mouse during the whole game.***</p>\n<p>\"Jugend\" comes from \"youth\" in German. \"The transition of the youth from their ideal life into civil society involves a painful process of adaptation punctuated by crises.\" Overall, it was a refusal to walk through the narrows, and a failed, gambling experiment. The pioneer, her ideal was too much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Credit:</p>\n<p>The puppet model: raptorface on Free3D\u00a0</p>\n<p>(https://free3d.com/3d-model/fully-rigged-doll-59739.html)</p>\n<p>The original woman model (face was adjusted): Meiyuansucai</p>\n<p>The shader of the souls: OccaSoftware on Unity Assets Store\u00a0</p>\n<p>(https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/os-easy-ghost-shader-ghost-effect-with-shader-graph-215366)</p>\n<p>The shader of the toxic gas: LushkinR on Unity Assets Store\u00a0</p>\n<p>(https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/49391)</p>\n<p>Part of the UI: shizume on Vecteezy\u00a0</p>\n<p>(https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/2202532-set-of-ui-and-hud-game-ready-elements-in-digital-and-cyberpunk-style)</p>\n<p>Warning Sound: JapanYoshiTheGamer on Freesound\u00a0</p>\n<p>(https://freesound.org/people/JapanYoshiTheGamer/)</p>\n<p>Font (normal): Jorge Algarin on Dafont\u00a0</p>\n<p>(https://www.dafont.com/jorge-algarin.d6454)</p>\n<p>Font (morse): Pixel Sagas on Dafont</p>\n<p>(https://www.dafont.com/pixel-sagas.d32)</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>David King, Maddalena Grattarola, Richard Sherriff;</p>\n<p>Jules Stuart, Roisin de Cogan, and all other people in UAL LCC 3D Workshop;</p>\n<p>Jiajun He, all my colleagues in UAL LCC MA Games Design 2021-2022, and all my other playtesters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T05:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bb/5bbfe8f1400798443ea154bf487d8477.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A Big Owl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
