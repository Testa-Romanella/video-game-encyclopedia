{"id": 961239, "slug": "number8", "name": "Number8", "name_original": "Number8", "description": "\"Number 8\" is a science fiction corridor shooter game with first/third-person elements and a plot. The protagonist wakes up in an unfamiliar hostile place. She doesn't remember her life and identity but has combat skills. Armed with a blaster, she decides to find a way out and figure out what happened and where she is. Texts of correspondence in computer terminals will help her understand this. On her way to freedom, she will encounter other hostile awakened beings and security systems: mines, turrets, robots, traps.<br/>\r\n   Awards will help her pass trials more easily and defeat enemies. The blaster can be equipped with a flashlight, automatic fire, enhanced shot, explosive charge. Time slowdown, fast running and enhanced jumps consume energy that restores itself. Special rewards increase its maximum amount.<br/>\r\n   The protagonist's body is protected from damage by a liquid crystal suit. It absorbs both energy damage and physical damage from falling or colliding with debris. The less health indicator she has, the less it covers her body and protects it. It can be restored using Core - they remain after the destruction of other awakened beings or can be found in rooms.<br/>\r\n   The musical design of the game will delight fans of electronic music. Sets of unique techno-style tracks will help the player create a fighting mood.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T02:48:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/331/33146ef24b49e0d8953c79f502637a57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArtTrace"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ArtTrace"], "esrb_rating": null}
