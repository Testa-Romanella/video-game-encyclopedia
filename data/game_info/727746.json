Work in progress !\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will embody a creature living on an island surrounded by fog, impossible to cross it whether by sea or sky. Rifts have appeared on the island letting out many scary and dangerous creatures.\u00a0\r\nYour goal will be to survive by collecting resources and building shelter. You will also be able to defend yourself against other creatures and even manipulate them to use them.\r\n\r\nFind out what happened and send all the creatures home!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the moment, the project is at its very beginning in the research phase, a prototype is available.  Some aspects of survival have started to be implemented as well as inventory management. However, not everything is functional\u00a0of course.\u00a0\r\nI will continue this project when I find time to devote myself to it.\r\nyou can switch in 1st and 3rd person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0The game is from a while ago.\r\n\r\n<p>Blueprint programming in UE4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:28:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f1/3f196d89ca1a3401b18e738ca3b3f765.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raphael Lecocq"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
