Its compelling mix of real-time storytelling and Dave Justus\u2019s suspenseful writing continues to capture the imaginations of countless players worldwide. <br/><br/>Lifeline 2 raises the bar with a new story almost twice as long as the original, with many more choices and paths to explore. Lifeline 2 features a 28-minute original soundtrack and is fully optimized for watchOS 2, delivering the best Lifeline experience on Apple Watch yet.<br/><br/>The second story in the Lifeline series connects you with Arika, a young woman on a deadly quest to avenge her parents and rescue her long-lost brother. Your choices will keep her alive and help her succeed as she faces mortal danger on her way to a final, fateful showdown against the forces that threaten all of humanity.<br/><br/>Lifeline stories play out in real time. As Arika travels to complete her quest, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you\u2019re free. You can even respond to Arika directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app on your phone.<br/><br/>After completing any story branch, you can rewind to earlier parts of the story, or speed through parts you\u2019ve already read. See what happens when you make a different choice: will you guide Arika virtuously, or cut corners to gain an edge? Seemingly simple actions can deeply affect the outcome. <br/><br/>Arika\u2019s story, and the fate of the world, depend on your judgment. You will face the consequences together, because Arika is relying on YOU. <br/><br/><br/>Lifeline 2 features no in-app purchases and no ads. An Internet connection is not required.<br/><br/>WATCH US: http://www.youtube.com/c/LifelineGame<br/><br/>Praise for the original Lifeline:<br/><br/>\u201c[A] surprising iPhone and Apple Watch bestseller is pushing the boundaries of fiction\u201d - boingboing.net<br/><br/>\u201cThis is the best game on the Apple Watch\u201d - Time.com<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.\u201d - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo<br/><br/>\u201cFor a few brief hours I cared \u2013 really cared \u2013 about the fate of a completely fictional character.
