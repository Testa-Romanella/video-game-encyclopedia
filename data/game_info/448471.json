One day he meets up with a wizard from earth. this latter doesn't like Jazz's attitude\u00a0and so, he curses him with \"the slayer's curse\".</p>\n<p>When he was cursed he blacked out and woke up in a dungeon somewhere in the middle of nowhere. He finds out he can shoot infinite laser beams and transforms when he heats up. He has now to kill his way back to normal life.</p>\r\nThe game:\r\n<p>This game was made for the WGJ #150. So the story is still not fully incorporated.</p>\n<p>In this first part of the game, you will try to find a way out of the first dungeon, discovering the character's basic abilities.</p><p>The core mechanic of the game is that you lose points when you destroy blocks and actually in order to win, need to destroy blocks. In this sense you are the enemy, and the enemies you fight aren't because they actually help you get score.</p>\n<p>Watch the gameplay video on my YouTube channel:\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>Oh and by the way, this is my very first submission :-)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:57:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/feb/febac12108b94473b8524f922e53e652.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["netimu"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
