He must go from tower to tower and hack into them. Each tower has stronger network defences than the last. Once he has gained access to the top levels of the corporation he can take it down and restore freedom.</p>\n<p>Gameplay</p>\n<p>In the hacking minigame the camera is a top down view stationary to the player\u2019s position. The player is a neon red rectangle. The player moves and rotates, then shoots a gun. The projectile is a grey rectangle.</p>\n<p>Enemies are regular 2d shapes. The more sides it has, the more health (eg triangle for low level enemy, pentagon for stage boss, etc). They can move randomly around the level and shoot red projectiles towards the player.</p>\n<p>The level is completed when the player has shot down all the enemies. If the player takes too many hits, he must restart the level.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>The keyboard keys are WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Space or left mouse button is to shoot.</p>\n<p>Aiming is either controlled by IJKL or holding right mouse button and dragging in a direction.
