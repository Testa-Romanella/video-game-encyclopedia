You are one of the few people with the skills to actually do this. For each clock you will need to figure out where to place the gears and how to connect them. The customers will be grateful!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 51 game jam. The theme was <em>Every 10 Seconds</em>. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>I had a lot of plans for this game, but in the end it took me a long time to get the gear system to work. While the gears work quite well now, the game unfortunately does not have much content and polish. I hope you enjoy it nontheless :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T07:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29b/29b4e476e0e3c91e6209e4b98e960b6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Wuppos"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
