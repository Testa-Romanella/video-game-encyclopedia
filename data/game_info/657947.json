The main point being we could see the project from start to finish and pick up any skills we might need. We ended up with a game where you move a ball (Rory) around various levels with traps, collectibles and a timer to keep score. This project took roughly a month to make working for a few hours Monday-Fridays, using 'Unity Teams' this challenged us to keep track of file sizes and stick to the 1GB limit. We understand the game isn't visually stunning or mechanically strong but we thought rather than make something and leave, that we would upload it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game by Jake Simons &amp; Oliver Mota</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:49:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afa11132d6f015ee47b3c591d8077157.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Portal_Zombiez"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
