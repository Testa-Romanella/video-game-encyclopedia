From then on, you start viewing these art pieces for a while but then\r\nsomething very strange happens when you get closer and closer towards them...</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be using the default movement for your own Oculus Rift\r\nController as you travel towards doors simply by being near them as well as the\r\nOculus Headset to move the in-game camera. Also, in order to return back to the\r\nareas, you\u2019ll have to face your camera towards a visual red exit sign to take\r\nyou back to the museum spot.</p>\n<p>Developer Comment:</p>\n<p>This simulator will require you to use the Oculus Rift since the\r\ncamera does not work without the headset being set up beforehand. Also please\r\nbe aware that if you suffer motion sickness (as there is motion blur in the\r\ngame), I will be making another version without it in the near future.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T03:06:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16b931900f617687d6ddaed2ebc9d606.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MikeAdelu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
