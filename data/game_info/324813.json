It features a fully functioning custom editor, that allows designers to easily create a system of complex interactions between in-game objects and the player without writing a single line of code!</em></p>\n<p><em>The project has also been used as a chance to learn shaders development and integrate them with the code to create evocative visual effects.</em></p>\n\n<p>The project is a prototype for a bigger and wider game, that I might decide to develop in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The chosen design for Switch The Light was to create a custom system that would track the player\u2019s<br/>decisions and change the game environment and narrative accordingly. Along with this, the system<br/>was to have a custom editor visible within Unity featuring an accessible UI and intuitive to use even<br/>for someone who is not familiar with coding.<br/>Switch The Light was also designed to be a psychological 3D adventure, thus the game had to<br/>contain different VFX that would appeal to the player as well as have a deep meaning coherent with the narrative.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T05:21:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/847da5ac6377641c615e809c80762d12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rosie_Mable"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
