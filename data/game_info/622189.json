The game features 9 unique enemy types, spans 4 different locations, and has a story that will either cringe or make you chuckle at how ridiculous it is (english was never my best subject).</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>This game was never really intended for a large general audience. Initially, this game was made for my friends to play as a joke but I enjoyed creating it so much I decided to continued fleshing it out into what it is now. The game does contain some profanity and explicit language, caution is advised if you are easily offended.\u00a0\u00a0If you find any bugs or issues, please comment down below!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T01:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e87a14c4b04eb27fdc9dce440155791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kev1n_Ke1vin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
