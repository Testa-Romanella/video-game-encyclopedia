Its development started as a sequel to Terrobot\u00a0and over time transformed it to something completely different, whereas I would be able to create low-fi entries for the One Hour Game Jam. (No idea yet if I will actually do that.)</p>\n<p>You can code your own game/app/thing with Small Basic, which is one of the simplest programming languages existing. Games for Rats uses its own API (documentation).</p>\n<p>The project is WIP and probably never finished. The lack of a new version does NOT mean that there isn't a new game to play inside the console!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T14:40:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ec/7ec3c7facdce7d28d464eb2526c19a58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ratrogue"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
