Bend the five elements \u2013 Water, Earth, Air, Fire and Ether \u2013 and grow your way up - or down -\u00a0 to the pentacle!</p>\n<p>Every element and plant\u2019s behaviour comes with a particular sound effect and the soundtrack of the game is influenced by what you decide to do. Enter the Greenwitch Grove and settle into a flowery peaceful mood.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Game submitted for the Reconstruction Game Jam (2021).</p>\r\nHow to play?\r\n<p>You have to grow your plant up to the pentacle by using the diferent elements in order to give it direction and avoid obstacles.\u00a0You can select one element during daytime and must wait at night to see the result in the morning.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you just have to wait and watch your plant grow. But every once in a while, you'll have to give it a hand.</p>\n<ul><li>\"Water\" will let it grow up.\u00a0If the plant doesn't get water for a couple of turns it will bend down.\u00a0This could be part of your strategy though!</li><li>\"Air\" will let you call the wind and make the plant grow to the right or to the left. You can chose which direction you want the wind to blow by clicking on the yellow ribbon.</li><li>\"Earth\" will let the plant grow twice as fast the next morning.\u00a0Perfect if you're in a hurry!</li><li>\"Fire\" is here to cancel your last move.\u00a0But beware: afterwards, the plant will be needing water!</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Axel de Conti : Programming, Game Design, Pixel Art</li><li>Camille Berring: Pixel Art, Sound Design, Witchcraft</li><li>Benjamin Gobb\u00e9 : Soundtrack, Sound Design\r\n  </li><li>Martin Ringot : Game &amp; Level Design, Pixel Art, Text\u00a0\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T10:18:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52dd3628b0cfb5e220f3f271a248a5aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AveNyrh", "Martin Ringot", "Cressida7139", "Aafried"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
