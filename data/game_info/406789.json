Boss monsters are secret and wish u all to keep secret about them. Also especially the level 6 boss don't reveal it's secret to anyone.\r\nStage 1: Head right to reach stage 2 its quite high but u can do it if u just spam 'w'\r\n</p>\n<p>Stage2: Fall down and go to right corner. There is a wrong way but u will be fine as long as u fall down you can also reach infinity but stay sure to be in bounds of diagonal tiles. Figure out the mechanic on urself but remember to pick up card2 that is the only way to clear level 2 and further levels. You might be able to clear all levels without it that's completely upto you.\r\n</p>\n<p>Stage3: Made by my friend its completely cleared on the video above.</p>\n<p>Stage4: Boss 1(25 health) Secret mechanics</p>\n<p>Stage5: Boss 2(50 health)\u00a0\u00a0Secret mechanics</p>\n<p>Stage 6: Boss 3 (150 health) (Hint is helpful if u get touhou references) I beg u please keep it a secret even if u cleared it.
