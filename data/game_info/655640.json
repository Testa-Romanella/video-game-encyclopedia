As the new production line undermanager of Heaven Industries, you begin receiving some very strange work orders for new creations on The Eighth Day. You must fill out these work orders with increasing urgency by slapping different body parts and modifications on these horrific creations using your divine operating surface (DOS), all while learning on the job from your very own Employee Manual and preventing Satan from meddling with production efforts.</p>\n<p>Our game has a tutorial, but one thing I noticed by watching streamers\u00a0is that we didn't make it immediately clear how the 'add part' command is structured.</p>\n<p>Each part type (arm/leg/chest/head) has a few manual pages. The first page is the first character of the codes for those parts. Second page, second character.</p>\n<p>e.g.</p>\n<p>`h mm` for burger head</p>\n<p>`al bt` for trex arm</p>\n<p>or `c o` for donut chest</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T18:30:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3a/f3a0d7d5400e2b1a6f77fd5aecf76c1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["noneme", "polovsky"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
