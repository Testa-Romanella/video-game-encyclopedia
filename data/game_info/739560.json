For months users one-upped each other on the leaderboard, even becoming one of the most played games on the website that year, giving reason to tighten up the controls as well as add new monster girls and dungeon palettes in order to keep those long runs entertaining. </p>\n<p>For its release on Steam the game underwent a massive overhaul, re-doing characters sprites, adding rare shines, a gallery, controller support, and more. Where this version includes 7 original monster girl designs, the original release, which became unbelievably popular, only had 2 girls and 1 dungeon palette.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-16T03:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddf/ddffc399ec7f6acf23f058cd7e4bd393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ninjamuffin99"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
