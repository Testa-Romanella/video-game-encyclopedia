Currently supports the \"Dead of Winter\" Board Game with future support for the other games in the Crossroads series.<br/><br/>The App is a replacement for the Crossroads deck.  But it's not a simple substitute for it's cardboard counterpart.  The App presents the information on the cards in stages.  First the trigger is shown.  Next the narrative text is displayed along with the 'Thematic' options for each tough choice.
