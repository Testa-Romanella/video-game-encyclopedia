It's that time of the season again and this time everyone is going all out to show off how much food they have. As it gets closer to the potluck a few families all get the same idea to raid the chicken coop on a nearby farm. They all send their fastest members to steal as many eggs as they can. Will you be the fastest and steal the most eggs, or will you disappoint your family and be the community slow poke?</p>\n<p>Coop Scramble will have 2-4 Foxes in each match competing to hoard the most eggs in their den so they can make the best dish.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>In this zany game of egg collecting, you'll have to out wit and out maneuver your opponents to score more eggs than them and win the day!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:07:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcd13d14f785ff7657d9402fc9cc823b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cool Scoop Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
