I basically wanted to just recreate it with my own little spin on it so here it is, Spear Launchers! When you win you are awarded coins which you can use change the appearance of your spear and stick man in the shop. For this game I challenged myself to create all the art and sound assets as well as the coding, so every single thing you see, hear and experience in the game was created 100% by me. I appreciate you checking out the game! (meant to be played full screen)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T07:12:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3bb4828bc5b42a5309503d033a9d309.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["abarnes"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
