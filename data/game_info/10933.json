Campfire Games is devoted to presenting the gruesome and glorious elements of the period, while maintaining the highest level of historical accuracy and realism as is possible with the wonders of CRYENGINE. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers in the game will be able to play on multiple battlefields of the campaign, from the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers where the Siege of Harper's Ferry took place, to the ridgelines of South Mountain, and to the meandering waters of Antietam Creek at the Battle of Antietam. Additionally, players will also be able to choose from a list of regiments that fought in each battle as well as what rank to fight as, whether they want to slog it out as a lowly private, or if you want to orchestrate the carnage and mayhem as a major general. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUniforms and bodily features will all be customizable for other players to see as you march and fight in the lines of battle according to the tactics of the period. As a General, you will operate in your headquarters equipped with a map of the battlefield and constantly receiving reports of friendly and enemy positions. Send out new orders to the regiments to move forward, or fall back - all in real time. The orders will move down the chain of command, to the Colonels, Majors, down to the Captains in charge of the individual regiments, all of whom have the option to follow the orders of their trusted commander, or rebel against his wishes and fight as you see fit. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach map contains a period reconstruction of the buildings, farms, forests, roads, rocks, and Fancy Flowers that existed so players can fight through the streets of Harper's Ferry, in the wooded heights of Fox's Gap at South Mountain, or in the wheatfields and Bloody Lanes of Antietam. Players can feel the whiz of deadly shot and shell fly by their bodies, or hit their comrades or themselves as they scream in a bloody hail from their wounds. Limbs will fly and blood will be spilt once again as Campfire Games brings the fighting of the Civil War right to the player's computer screen! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWill you heed the Union call against the traitors? Or will you fight to defend your family and livelihood with the Confederacy? You decide!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05a/05a4e3ce7dbd22ba885ae2010f897126.jpg", "website": "https://warofrights.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 43, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 490, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Campfire Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Campfire Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
