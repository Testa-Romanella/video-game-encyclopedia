Space :) ...Only kidding. It's actually based on a game I made for Ludum Dare <strong>2</strong>4, approx. 3 years and 4 months ago, called \"@#$% Life! I'm The God Damn SUN\". All the graphics were drawn in flash and the entire game was programmed in the free edition of Construct 2. I've ported the game to work on Desktop (after fixing the frame-rate dependence since I didn't know what Delta-time was back in the day) and you can play it here.</p><p><strong>Q: ...I can't think of anymore questions.</strong><br/></p><p><strong>A: </strong>Me either. That was fast.</p><p><strong>[/FAQ]</strong><br/></p><p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a18/a18a3b13fc72f4d5e33663b52d77cb20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phobos001"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
