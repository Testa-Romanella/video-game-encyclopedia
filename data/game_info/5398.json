{"id": 5398, "slug": "wipeout-hd", "name": "WipEout HD", "name_original": "WipEout HD", "description": "<p>WipEout HD is a sci-fi arcade racing game developed by Sony Studio Liverpool. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players use the futuristic anti-gravitational vehicles and participate in the FX350 anti-grav racing league. The game features all the previous tracks and vehicles from Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse, which were released on the PlayStation Portable. </p>\n<p>WipEout HD is not a remastered game in a common meaning. It is more of a spiritual successor of the core mechanics that were introduced to the public in the previous installments of the series. </p>\n<p>Five modes are present in the game: a standard race, a Tournament mode, Time trials, Speed laps, and Zone Mode, where the players have to avoid crashing while their vehicle speeds up more and more. A photo mode is also available to the players. Photo mode is available at any point during gameplay, as it freezes the race the player participates in at the moment, allows to change camera position, and change exposure, lens focus or add depth of field.</p>\n<p>The ships in the game feature four base stats: speed, acceleration, maneuverability, and shield strength. During gameplay, the players are able to pick up offensive or defensive weapons. Every weapon featured in the game was featured in the previous installment. For example, machine guns, missiles, landmines and so on.</p>\n<h3>Fury expansion pack</h3>\n<p>Fury expansion pack was released a year after the base game release. It featured eight tracks, 13 new vehicles, three game modes, and a new revamped campaign mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T22:00:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9e/b9eb7adfc7c19618c507ab03694fc76f.jpg", "website": "http://www.wipeouthd.com", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 26, "owned": 791, "beaten": 50, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 75, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 125, "suggestions_count": 499, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 125, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "SCE Studio Liverpool"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
