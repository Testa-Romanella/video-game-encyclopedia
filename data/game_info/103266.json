Blast off into space and destroy them all to preserve life as we know it back on Earth!<br/></p>\n<p>Nu-retro arcade style shooting designed to challenge and enthrall; this is your game on drugs. Shoot rocks, get POW. Survive. <br/><br/>Featuring a '90 Euro/rave-inspired soundtrack, over 120 waves of sadistic space shootables and an eyeball-tickling aesthetic, this is going to knock your socks off - hope you bought a spare pair.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Controls</em></p>\n<p>To control N.E.O - Near Earth Objects, simply choose your input device; XBox 360 controller, mouse or touchscreen are supported -- and if you want to kick it oldschool with your computer's keyboard, remap the controls how you want them.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you're using a mouse or a touchscreen, click/touch a part of the screen to make the ship fire at that location. Keep your finger down to thrust toward that area; but don't go too fast!</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKeyboard and controller users will find a classic-styled turn left/right and thrust scheme.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Additional controls</em><br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tIn-game, use PAUSE to pause/unpause the game. ESCAPE key will ask if you'd like to quit the game: press 'Y' to confirm and any other key to cancel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65a8983b6474cb613e6a64a8a1c9a674.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spooky Cookie Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
