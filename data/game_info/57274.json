There is a neutral party made of other Japanese generals and rulers. Units must be deployed for both protection and attack. Natural disasters occur on a random basis, and diplomacy doesn't always work, so that combat is the main feature.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a9/3a9b869d8d4329fb6da41a9bbbf8ad52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["Namco Tales Studio", "Wolf Team"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Wolf Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
