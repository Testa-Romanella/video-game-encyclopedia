Your avatar will start off as weak and frail with one heart. Across the stage are critters' you can fuse with, granting you a custom moveset and 2 hearts! Critters each have one offensive and secondary ability, so learn them all!</p><p>*Note that Critter clash requires a xbox360 or ps3 to play and is in a unfinished state! If you do not have the available players you can que dummy characters by bringing up the debug menu with ctrl+shift+D.
