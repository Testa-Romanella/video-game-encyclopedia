There were going to be a few more game mechanics, a clear narrative, a menu system, and a 5 track EP, all expressing the importance of rest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So many people have stepped forward to do amazing things for the BLM movement, but I know that we as black people are weary, and allies are likely to experience burnout, so I wanted to create something that gave us all permission to heal before the next fight.<br/></p>\n<p>I became obsessed with getting this experience done in record time so that I wouldn't miss \"the moment.\" The moment we win. The moment we lose. The moment when the fire burns brightest or is snuffed out.\u00a0The moment when eyes, and ears, and doors are opened. The moment before we are cast back into silence and darkness.</p>\n<p>After a few days without sleep,\u00a0I realized the irony of what was happening. I was working myself to death trying to preach about the values of rest. I took a few hours off, watched some youtube videos, skated a bit, and decide to publish what I had. Here's why:</p>\n<p>1. The moment is a myth. The battle against racism is long. I will not miss the end of hate if I take a few hours to rest, and I refuse to allow things to go back to the way they were. You shouldn't either. Now that the door is open, we cannot allow it to close.</p>\n<p>2. Black people are required to exceed a standard that was set without considering them in the first. Black creators must manage the conflict between\u00a0 the adherence to this expectation and the rejection of standards that is\u00a0necessary to create in the first place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This little experience says and does all that I want it to say and do. The world is littered with experiences, digital and otherwise, that are little and tiny and broken and beautiful. I love them, I am grateful to the creators who make them, and I am happy to contribute my own voice to the chorus.</p>\n<p>I will continue to explore those other elements, and I\u00a0 may still complete the original project but, if I don't, that's okay. This is enough for me and mine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a9c0b8bf978ab72e0fe3f95b80aa46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["raysofnope"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
