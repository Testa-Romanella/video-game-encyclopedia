The coins are used to provide incentive for the player and help guide them through an \"optimal\" path through the level, though there are other pathways that will also let them collect all the coins in the allotted time.</p>\n<p>This game ascribes to the concept of \"learning through playing\", where game concepts and mechanics are shown through the level itself, and not explicitly told outside of basic movement instructions.</p>\n<p>Created by Ben Reyes 09/13/2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T08:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d4311ddfaa9fe906b9e840d97f983b4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ben Reyes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
