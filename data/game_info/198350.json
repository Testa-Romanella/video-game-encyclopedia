This puzzle game is great for all ages and works off the idea of tangrams. It works fine on a normal PC, but it is best when played on a touch screen PC. As a small and simple game, this is great if you just want to kill some dead time. It's easy to learn, but hard to master.</p><p>Don't want to download it?
