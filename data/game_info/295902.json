You will push back bit by bit and reclaim lost parts of the house while shutting down ethically dubious experiments that the Tans are running. Team up with toys as weary as you who just want to return to a simpler life and uncover the political machinations at play driving this ever lasting conflict. (btw this is a one person project so progress might be slow when there are major roadblocks.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/355/35557742f2021f01af738fc3989a9163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hot Off the Stack Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
