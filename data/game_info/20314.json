The more the merrier!<br/><br/>Play with friends or with strangers - quickly join a match with a click or carefully search through the list of games currently being played to find the one that is right for you. And if online is not your thing you can play locally, exploring the world in split screen! The choice is yours. We try not to limit how players can enjoy the game's multiplayer.<br/><br/>Enjoy the depth the game has to offer thanks to the skills of each class in your party: perhaps one player can focus on health items and crafting while another takes the fight to the munchers with a high damage output. Some classes are better at crafting than others, and some can take less damage, making them the perfect tank to lure the munchers away from the group as they prepare an onslaught. Mix and match the classes and you\u2019ll enjoy a fresh experience every time you play!<br/><br/>As this project progresses further, we will devise some new and exciting ways to play multiplayer, and these updates and additional content will be made available absolutely at no cost for those that own the game!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:44:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/555/5551f25b76cefb473344783fe754f7a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 102, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamestarters"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gamestarters Publisher", "Gamestarter's"], "esrb_rating": null}
