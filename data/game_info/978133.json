You can combine them into words, like this. <br/><br/><br/>You click on the word to get a score for the number/type of letters you have in the word. <br/><br/>(You get 8 points for the word, \"WORD\", as 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 8)<br/><br/>If two or more words share any letters, they join into a group, When you clear the group, you get a multiplier score for each word in the group.<br/><br/><br/>There are two modes, an Endless Mode, and a Matrix Mode.<br/><br/>In the Endless Mode, new letters spawn and are added to the grid every time the timer bar runs out. The new letters spawn faster and faster as time goes on.<br/><br/><br/>In the Matrix Mode, every tile in the grid is filled in, and the goal is to clear all of the letters to get the highest score you can.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T08:34:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a62/a62ce9546e78689791843df348ff4d73.jpg", "website": "https://herearesomeletters.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rupour"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rupour"], "esrb_rating": null}
