Build up your teams economy, construct your fortified battle lines, and push the opponents back.  - or at least that's what we hope...<br/><br/>TrenchesWIP is an ongoing project where a handful of devs decide to make the game they want to play, available publicly from day one - warts and all. A world war inspired <strong>multiplayer</strong> First-person shooter, with infantry, vehicular, and airborne combat - coupled with economic base building and construction.<br/><br/>In TrenchesWIP - we want to make a <strong>sandbox shooter</strong> where the players can decide how to overcome the enemy. Opponents dug in a fortified trench line? Sight in your allied player's artillery to destroy it from afar. Enemy tanks pushing you back? Set a minefield and lure them in. Destroy the bridge behind the enemy line to cut them off and rain shells down on them from afar. We want to give players a sandbox approach to first-person combat - and we need your help to do it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:10:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/420/4204c18d368a2df6b5ebffe1145d37bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 450, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big OOF Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
