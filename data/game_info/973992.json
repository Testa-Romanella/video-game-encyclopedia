Only the Gods can even comprehend the nature of this threat, and only the Soulkeepers, those chosen by the Goddess Frigg, can stand against it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Frigga Union of Soulkeepers, hitherto tasked with persuit of the vile Naez, now work to research and unravel the paradox of the Twisted Dimensions before this mass of shattered realms consumes itself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThey discovered that Naez originates from the Soul of Agony.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe original task of the Soulkeepers was to seek out the taint of the corrupted blood of the Primal Giants, enemies of the Gods, and return the Giants to the Soul Stream. Thus would the world remain in balance.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNaez used the power of Soul of Agony to direct the extracted souls into herself instead of the Soul Stream. Thus, the flow of souls was disrupted, and the boundaries between the worlds weakened.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo counter the damage inflicted by Naez, Souls of Chaos must be gathered and delivered to the Soul Stream. The Frigga Union is focused on this task, holding the doom of the world at bay, until the time comes to attack the threat at its source\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T07:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03b/03b378503935e3e87af28799f5307ebf.jpg", "website": "https://eos.papayaplay.com/eos.do?tp=home", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 17}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bluepotion Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Vertigo Games America,INC."], "esrb_rating": null}
