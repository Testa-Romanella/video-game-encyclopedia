I did the nav-mesh work myself, though, including building the functionality for the animations to play.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't find a good way to implement it, but a running animation plays when they reach a certain speed. Space\u00a0Robot Kyle came Pre-rigged, but the piloting animations were made by me. I coded the elevator myself, but the animations and models came with the Sifi Styled Modular Pack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9c/d9c62ed0da7f5324df1b402fd8a6567e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skylar Nichols"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
