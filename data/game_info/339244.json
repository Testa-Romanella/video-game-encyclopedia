Set in the winter shrouded wilderness between Lilygrove and Redwall\u2122 Abbey, help Liam or Sophia race for help from the raiding rats under Scumsnout's command. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Scout\u201d is the first episode of \u201cThe Lost Legends of Redwall\u2122\u201d and is best understood as a stealth-adventure game, taking place in the middle of winter prior to the events of the original \u201cRedwall\u2122\u201d book.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Scout\u201d tells the story of a mouse who is driven to Redwall Abbey when sea rats raid the peaceful village of Lilygrove. Not too far from the storied walls of Redwall\u2122 Abbey is a small village of mice and moles called Lilygrove. Our hero, Sophia, is the newest member of the Lilygrove Scout Corps, a group of woodland rangers tasked with the protection of the little village and trained in the ancient ways of woodcraft. But her graduation is cut short by the sudden raid from a band of sea rats led by the brutal wearet, Scumsnout. It will take all of her wit and guile to make it out alive!\r\n\r\nThe events of \u201cThe Scout\u201d play out along the ancient, but now altered, course of the mighty River Moss. What was once a wide river is now the sunken bed of a seasonal creek that that runs east-west between Redwall Abbey and the Great South Stream that feeds the swamps south and east of Salamandastron. The player must find a way through the confusing snow-covered channel punctuated by occasional hedgerows, ancient stone walls, scattered shacks, and the few-and far-between hearths of friendly woodlanders. Along the way there is untold adventure to include (of course) feasting, fiddling, and even a few fisticuffs as we meet Valo Scrimpaw, the mysterious stoat who lives in the Winsome Wraith, Scumsnout the murderous weret, and even the ghost of Martin who offers assistance just when all seems lost.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T16:20:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f4/3f4142121ae1b0ce843715a375636926.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["BS Holdings"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
