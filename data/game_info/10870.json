Over the course of 60+ puzzles, players discover new logical mechanics and incorporate them into their thinking. No two puzzles look the same, every puzzle can be solved logically, and every solution is unique.<br/><br/><br/><br/>RYB was programmed by two MIT graduates and designed by a Top-10 finisher in the US Puzzle Championship.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-25T02:23:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abc/abc27c9a9f2954fec8f3b6bdfac83c1f.jpg", "website": "http://www.flebpuzzles.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 26, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["FLEB"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["FLEB"], "esrb_rating": null}
