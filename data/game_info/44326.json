Train to beat tougher dungeons, unlock new classes and decor, and furnish your shop smartly to maximize profits and customer purchases, plus much more!<br/><br/><br/>- Purchase different kinds of tables, shelves, and decorations that affect different stats such as gold bonuses and customer choices<br/>- Different dungeon types, enemies, and unlockable worlds so battle gameplay is not always the same<br/>- Different bags you can obtain what give special effects such as delivering directly to inventory and multiplying an item type you collect!<br/>- Unlockable character classes that have different preferences and gifts that you can use<br/>- Crafting! Make your own items that customers will pay a premium for, or use them yourself to boost your stats<br/>- Expand your shop to house more wares and remodel it with decorations to go for a certain look and add boosts<br/>- Plant your own herbs (among other things) to use in battle or to sell, with chance of getting rarer seeds<br/>- Get far enough to buy a second shop and hire managers to work for you<br/>- More features and updates coming!<br/><br/><br/>- In this game you will be clicking quite a bit. There are in-game items that alleviate that, but just fair warning in the beginning!<br/>- As a simulation game it might start out slow as you build yourself up, so if you are bored easily, this might be important. It will eventually ramp up<br/>- The default Challenge mode could be frustrating if you are not into the min-maxing of the genre. I recommend Sandbox or \"Chill Mode\" to start<br/>- If you want an in-depth and real-time look at gameplay, check out the Let's Play video by YouTuber KatherineOfSky below<br/><br/>Thanks so much for the interest and I hope you enjoy the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/685/6851b2c2c49c128498acfd16cd50713e.jpg", "website": "http://www.pixelshopkeeper.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 22, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pixel Prototype"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
