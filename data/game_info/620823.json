You\u2019ve been tasked with chaperoning this year\u2019s trip to the Omniscience Retreat by your mentor, Chuck Thunderwrath. Will you be able to guide your troubled students and resist temptation?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hands of God - Omniscience Camp based in an Urban Fantasy High School AU of DotA 2. The gameplay works as an interactive story focused on character development.</p>\n<p>Though it is a fangame, it can be played and understood regardless of knowledge of the source material.<br/>We made this as a personal project, and want to share it with anyone who may be interested, and in no way claim ownership over the characters or setting of Dota 2. This game will not be monetized in any way, is a\u00a0transformative work, and falls under Fair Use.<br/></p>\n<p>While this game is mostly light in tone, it does cover heavier themes involving dogmatic religion and internalised homophobia. The game contains implied sexual themes but nothing outright NSFW in either art or writing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:25:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d39/d39f77ac0034a56adfebb20cdba0755b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["heartsworn games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
