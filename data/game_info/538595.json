It involves searching crime scenes for evidence, combining clues and questioning suspects. Puzzles can have multiple solutions as you guide the protagonist - Detective Will Stanhope - through the story.</p>\n<p>Stanhope will sometimes be presented with alternative ways to handle a conversation, based on four temperaments:</p>\n<p>Melancholic (detail oriented)<br/>Phlegmatic (calm)<br/>Sanguine (sociable)<br/>Choleric (driven)</p>\n<p>There is no one approach that works best for all conversations, and Stanhope will need to use all fo them in order to be the best he can be.</p>\n<p>This game adapts to your choices. People will remember how Stanhope spoke to them and may respond differently in the future, so consider each response carefully. Will Stanhope's destiny is in your hands.</p>\n<p>Choose wisely.</p>\n<p>The demo is available now, with a full release planned in 2021. </p><p>Your first task is to gain three pieces of information/leads and discuss with detective Luna, before leaving the apartment block and opening up the rest of the demo.</p>All feedback is welcome.
