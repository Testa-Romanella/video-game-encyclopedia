Dynamic Battles with Weather and Items</h3>An unchanging battlefield is a boring one. Therefore, we've added a random weather and item system, spicing up the battlefield with dynamic charm!<br/>Weather change happens every 10 seconds, applying different environmental effects, such as:<br/><ul><li>Scorching Sun: staying in the heated sun beam for more than 3 seconds makes you lose 1 HP.<br/></li><li>Sunny: if an enemy's health is depleted in the air, they are immediately KO'd with no chance to recover (a certain shrine maiden's favorite).<br/></li><li>Sand Storm: flying for more than 3 seconds in the air without touching the ground makes you lose 1 HP.<br/></li><li>Thunder: an invincible ball of electricity spawns in the battlefield, KO'ing anyone who gets in its path.<br/></li><li>...And 9 other weathers.</li></ul><br/><br/>\u25b2 Three enemies taken out by a ball of electricity\u2014an easy victory!<br/><br/>Items fall from the sky every 10 seconds. They can be used at any time once picked up. Some help you, and some hinder the enemy. For example:<br/><ul><li>Giant Popsicle: eat to immediately gain 1 HP.<br/></li><li>Durian: force all enemies to the ground, unable to fly.<br/></li><li>Boomerang: pierces all enemies in its path.<br/></li><li>Shrimp Sushi: dash infinitely for a short amount of time.<br/></li><li>...And 22 other items.</li></ul><br/><br/>\u25b2 Dash around the battlefield with shrimp sushi!<br/><br/><br/><br/>What's a game without some collectibles?<br/>Of course, Touhou Fairy Knockout has an abundance of them too.
