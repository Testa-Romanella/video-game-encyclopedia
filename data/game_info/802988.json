However, details about the game can be read below.\u00a0Only mouse/touchscreen controls at the moment.<br/><br/>This game is in early alpha stage and may contain bugs!</p>\n<p>Planned for future versions:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Bunch more puzzles</li><li>Better sounds</li><li>Music</li><li>Level Editor</li><li>Lots of new objects</li><li>Proper HUD/menus</li></ul>\n\n<p>Created with\u00a0GDevelop 5</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Get Beryl\u00a0\u00a0to the glowing platform to complete each puzzle. Any \"free\" object can be moved by dragging it to adjacent squares. Some objects are \"stuck\" and will only move if the tile holding them is destroyed.</p>\n<p>Objects have various interactions with the environment. For example, a wall can be destroyed by dragging a fireball\u00a0 into it.<br/><br/>Some hazards such as holes and water will \"absorb\" objects. Depending on the combination, the object may \"fill\" the space (creating a bridge) or otherwise nullify the obstacle. Some objects will simply disappear.</p>\n<p>Terrain such as ice can\u00a0affect the movement of objects. When an object hits ice, it will slide until it is blocked or reaches a different terrain. Objects that are sliding cannot be redirected mid-slide, and they will not push other objects they run into.</p>\n<p>Beryl will try not to jump into hazards, but in\u00a0situations like sliding on ice, it is unavoidable. Be careful where you step!</p>\n<p>Click on the arrow in the bottom left corner to reset the current puzzle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T12:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57a/57ad8e1f62ce081d65a8fe74514ee51e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Magicsofa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
