It was made within\u00a048 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>You're flying humanity's last defense against the impending asteroid shower: the Delta Fighter. Shoot asteroids, fly through rings like a boss, and advance through the levels... until you're eventually overwhelmed. Power isn't free though, and each shot you make will cost you shield energy.</p>\n<p>If you deplete your shields, you'll be left vulnerable to the asteroids. Aim carefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/><strong>Mouse:</strong> Aim, select<br/><strong>Left-click/Spacebar:</strong> Shoot<br/></p>\n<p>*NOTE: Looks like the thrusters aren't being displayed properly in HTML5. If possible, I recommend the .exe, it plays much more like I intended. Sorry about that!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cac/cacdef654a659c6c6d11befdea4554ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LiauJ"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
