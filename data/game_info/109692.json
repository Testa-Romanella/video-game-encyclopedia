Just like in real life, in this mash-up of <strong>physics sandbox</strong> and <strong>Klondike solitaire</strong>, it's up to you to play by the rules and avoid cheating. (Can't remember how to play without double-clicking? Here are some rules to get you started.) You decide when you're \"done\" or when you've \"won.\" (The reload button in the upper right will deal you another game.)</p>\n<p>You can relax here. A cloud is passing in front of the sun. Someone's practicing the piano in another room. Don't let your tea get cold.</p>\n<p>(Press escape to exit. That's the feature I always forget to include and I didn't this time.)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong> The Windows version has been updated to fix a game-breaking graphics bug.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0d29ff4fe0b3f93200b9b474243281c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dougvalenta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
