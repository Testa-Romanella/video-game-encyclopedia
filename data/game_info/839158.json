About the Utsushiyochigai</strong><br/>\u3000Utsushiyochigai<br/>\u3000It is a world that exists parallel to the present world in which we live, a world inhabited by gods and Yokai.<br/>\u3000It is a parallel world that was once connected to this world, another Japan.<br/><br/>\u3000The inhabitants of the two worlds have long held traditional festivals and events, <br/>\u3000and humans, gods, and Yokai have shared civilizations. However, with the passage of time, <br/>\u3000interaction with the Utsushiyochigai decreased and their culture became obsolete. <br/>\u3000Eventually, humans forgot their boundaries with the Utsushiyochigai and lost their relationship with the gods and Yokai. <br/>\u3000In this way, the gods and Yokai became a part of this world. <br/>\u3000Thus, gods and Yokai disappeared from our world and were treated as phantom beings. <br/>\u3000They are now treated as phantom beings.<br/><br/>\u3000<strong>\u2161. About \"KIK\u201d</strong><br/>\u3000Setsuna is an office worker. <br/>\u3000Through a certain event, she meets the Yokai Tsukumo and is able to travel between the two worlds.<br/>\u3000Tsukumo is a clock Yokai and can use the power of \"Kokuikkoku(KIK)\" to manipulate time.<br/>\u3000Setsuna, too, has learned to use her Yokai powers through her encounter with Tsukumo, <br/>\u3000and has gained the ability to fight Yokai.<br/>\u3000Tsukumo is bored.<br/>\u3000Tsukumo offers Setsuna an interesting proposition. <br/>\u3000The two of them then go to Utsushiyochigai to exterminate Yokai, which is their daily routine.<br/><br/>\u3000<strong>\u2162. The Beginning</strong><br/>\u3000There is an abandoned house on a secluded beach in Utsushiyochigai.<br/>\u3000Once upon a time, there were many houses near this beach, and the area flourished as a fisherman's village.<br/>\u3000One day, however, a young man who went fishing suddenly disappeared.<br/>\u3000People gradually moved away from the beach, <br/>\u3000thinking it was the work of a terrifying Yokai, but the young man's family did not leave the beach and continued to wait for his return.<br/>\u3000In the end, however, the young man never returned home.<br/>\u3000One day, several hundred years later, an eerie voice could be heard coming from an abandoned house in the middle of the night. <br/>\u3000It turned out to be the family of the young man who had become a Yokai out of hatred for the sea that had kidnapped their son. <br/>\u3000Day by day, the voices grew louder and louder.<br/>\u3000The voices grew louder and louder day by day, and more and more Yokai began to appear on the beach. Soon, <br/>\u3000the sea became rough on many days due to the influence of the Yokai, and no one went out to fish.<br/>\u3000People were afraid and prayed to the gods for the Yokai to subside.<br/><br/>\u3000<strong>\u2163. Beginning of Journey</strong><br/>\u3000Having overheard the whole story about the incident on the beach, <br/>\u3000Tsukumo was gathering information in Utsushiyochigai. <br/>\u3000Tsukumo's preliminary investigation had led him to the existence of an abandoned house<br/>\u3000that had fallen into disrepair, but he did not know why it had fallen into disrepair.<br/>\u3000Back in our world, Tsukumo happily told Setsuna about the incident at the beach.<br/><br/>\u3000\"Setsuna, I know you've been wanting to go fishing lately.\"<br/>\u3000Setsuna knew what Tsukumo was going to say.<br/>\u3000<br/> \u3000Setsuna says,\"What do you mean? I'm not interested in fishing.\"<br/>\u3000\"There are beaches where you can catch a lot of fish!\"<br/>\u3000\"Tsukumo doesn't want to go fishing, does he? Besides, I've never been fishing.\"<br/>\u3000\"Hmmm...then...maybe if you solve the case on the beach, the snapper and flatheads will dance for you!\"<br/>\u3000\"That would be Urashima Taro*. I'd rather eat fish than watch them dance.\"<br/>\u3000\"It would be more interesting if the fish danced.\"<br/>\u3000\"Calm down. Fish can't dance.\"<br/>\u3000\"Are you going? You're not going?\"<br/>\u3000\"Yes, yes. I'm going.\"<br/>\u3000They thought that there was a powerful youkai in the abandoned house, <br/>\u3000so they set out on another journey to Utsushiyochigai today.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T04:52:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/454/454766e6879db19bcc4e05f95d8db8a1.jpg", "website": "https://no1-the-tomato.jimdofree.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u770c\u5de5\u60c5\u5831\u51e6\u7406\u90e8(KENKOUJSB)"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u770c\u5de5\u60c5\u5831\u51e6\u7406\u90e8(KENKOUJSB)"], "esrb_rating": null}
