This game was heavily inspired by a mini game in the fantastic RPG called Bug Fables which I highly encourage you check out at https://dangen-entertainment.itch.io/bug-fables<br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Your goal is to reach the highest score and proceed through the levels. To beat a level, you need to find the button which unlocks the firewall to the exit. Enemies will be in your way though, but you can defeat them to earn points. If they attack you, you can shield against it granting you a chance to IMMEDIATELY attack back! If you sustain damage, grab the RAM sticks in your path to heal up.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a relatively fast paced game focused on navigation and simple combat all in a very simple mechanic.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>4 game modes (standard, challenge, endless and speed)</li><li>Flashy visuals reminiscent of computer environment and components</li><li>An electronic style selection of music (all licensed under CC by attributions, see below for details)</li><li>Full keyboard and controller support with the option to rebind all the controls (not all controllers are natively supported, please use the rebinder in such case which will most likely work)</li><li>Support for Windows, Linux and MacOS</li></ul>\r\nDefault keyboard controls\r\n<ul><li>Move/Rotate with the arrow keys</li><li>Attack/Confirm with the X key</li><li>Lock rotation/Cancel with the Z key (lock rotation allows to move sideways without turning when held)</li><li>Shield with the C key</li><li>Pause with ESC</li></ul>\r\nSongs\u00a0credits\r\n<p>Here are all the credits relating to the songs used in the game:</p>\n<p><em>Standard mode song: Fireworks by Alexander Nakarada (www.serpentsoundstudios.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</em></p>\n<p><em>Challenge mode song: Screen Saver by\u00a0Kevin MacLeod<br/>(https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5715-screen-saver/)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</em></p>\n<p><em>Endless mode song: Space Ambience by Alexander Nakarada (www.serpentsoundstudios.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Speed mode song: </em>Chronos <em>by Alexander Nakarada (</em><em>www.serpentsoundstudios.com</em><em>)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></em></p>\r\nFinal words\r\n<p>This is my first game.
