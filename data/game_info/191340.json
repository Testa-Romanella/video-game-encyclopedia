The theme was \"Cloning\" and I elected to make a game where you create a little professor who can clone himself to solve some puzzles.</p><p>Later on you get the ability to swap position with what you fire upon, which is very useful to get around.</p><p>The game has 9 levels, each introducing a new mechanic. Each level completion is rewarded with 0-3 stars. Use as few clones as possible to earn 3 stars.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eksepsjon"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
