The stories of extortion and blackmail coming out of the\u00a0the mining worlds of Kepler-47 keep the crew laughing through the night. You're becoming a celebrity around here!</p>\n<p>I hope it comes as no surprise that you are once again cordially invited to the Still Independent Criminal Association's annual Gala. We know you love free food, free drinks, gambling, dancing, and general mayhem, so we put it all together in one convenient place. The Gala will host all the galaxy's brightest and most successful criminals and provide plenty of opportunities to mingle and make friends.<br/></p>\n<p>We hope you can join us on the Space Blimp. We recently renovated our ship and it is truly pristine. We cannot wait to show you.</p>\n<p>See you soon,</p>\n<p>Robo Maestro</p>\n<p><em>PS: Mwuahahahah, mwuahahaha!</em></p>\n\n\n<p>That's what my invitation tickets say. Too bad for them, I'm not afraid of a criminal mastermind collective. Too bad for them, I live for danger. Too bad for them, my name isn't Fellow Crook, it's...</p>\n\n<p>Space Spy.</p>\n<p>And I've got a mission to infiltrate the party.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:06:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ea/7ea3beeebde6271defda88ffd3af102e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["olivieryc", "puggsoy", "kalelovil", "NevEagleson", "SlimTimSnail", "ndemaio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
