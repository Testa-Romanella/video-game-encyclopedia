I was called back for a few days by my colleagues in a nearby town, and I will be unable to take care of the shop for this time. For this reason I have decided to leave it in your care, my young apprentice. Mind this place, as my precious refuge and main refueling place for adventurers from all overland, and I recommend that you always treat everyone to your best. No one in here would be able to handle this place better than you, so you have all my confidence. So I would do a great job.\r\n</p>\n<p>Have a nice day,\u00a0your teacher, Neri.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Q - Drop object</p>\n<p>F - Interact</p>\n<p>The game supports pads for Xbox, PlayStation and Switch (even on UI)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T14:27:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dac/dac18d7cf3b8d4f0cceb1e3f64351348.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nameless Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
