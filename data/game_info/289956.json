Activation key must be used on a valid Steam account, requires internet connection.  ABOUT THE GAME\t\t\t\t\t\tThe \u201eCitybus O305G\u201c allows you to take a journey through time. The \u201eCitybus O305G \u201c as a pure vehicle add-on aims to build a virtual monument for the articulated pusher busses of the first generation and sends you right back into the early 1980s.  \tThe add-on \u201cCitybus 0305G\u201d contains two variants of the articulated pusher bus for OMSI 2. The eye catchers are the different fronts of the busses. One related to the \u201cV\u00d6V-Front\u201d and the other to the \u201cSt\u00fcLB-Front\u201d. Both models come in different colour and interior variants. Another highlight is the authentic pollution model and the start behavior that is affected by weather and battery conditions.\t The busses have a manually changeable rolling band display and can be used on the OMSI 2 default maps \u201cBerlin-Spandau\u201d and \u201cGrundorf\u201d.\t   Hint: We recommend using this articulated pusher bus in combination with the OMSI add-on \u201eCitybus 0305\u201c since it also contains hof-files and suitable varnishes for those.KEY FEATURES  Two variants of the articulated pusher bus with different fronts    Different colour painting and interior design variants    Realistic models and sounds based on the real-world O305G    Authentic pollution model    Automatic doors (middle and back)    Stop request button with original sounds    Weather and battery affected starting behaviour    Rolling band display for Spandau line 92, Grundorf line 76 and city bus sphere \u201cNeuendorf\u201d    Repaintable in combination with the OMSI-Repaint-ToolSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS \t\t    OMSI 2 \u2013 The Omnibus Simulator min. 2.2.032  Operating System: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8.1 / 10  Processor (CPU): min. 2.8 GHz  Memory (RAM): min. 4 GB  Free hard disk space: 400 MB  Graphics card: min. 1024 MB, DirectX 9.0c or higher", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-23T11:08:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/679/67981e9e6e152efa5779d7057057c942.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Aerosoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
