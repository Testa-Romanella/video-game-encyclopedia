{"id": 16223, "slug": "hack-n-slash", "name": "Hack 'n' Slash", "name_original": "Hack 'n' Slash", "description": "<p>Hack &#39;n&#39; Slash is a top-down action game created by Double Fine Productions. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The head wizard of the village where Alice lives in mandates everyone to stay inside their homes, the village&#39;s armory begins to make weapons that nobody is allowed to carry and the people who try to figure out what is going out get killed. You do not buy that these laws were made for your protection. Alice gets out of her house and goes on to unravel the mystery.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Hack &#39;n&#39; Slash takes the word Hack seriously, as the players can literally hack the game&#39;s world using their USB Sword. The players use the sword to defeat the enemies met in dungeons or the village. The sword can also be used to interact with any in-game object that has a USB port. Sometime later into the game, the players can alter the behavior of their enemies by using the sword.</p>\n<p>The main protagonist also gets a hold of the Third Eye Hat (an homage to internet slang), which is used to access a debugging console. This console was used by Double Fine themselves. It allows the players to peek into the containers, or examine the code to figure out what they have to do next. The players can even adjust the in-game clock which affects the flow of the game&#39;s time. </p>\n<p>A character progression system is present in the game as the players can find books on various aspects of the game, which later allows the players to hack more and more in-game objects.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2014-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:08:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfb/cfbacead71a46900fd2f90f01785ac43.jpg", "website": "http://www.hacknslashthegame.com/", "rating": 2.78, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 83, "owned": 1088, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 22, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 45, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 45, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Double Fine Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Double Fine Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
