Drifting occurs not due to a button, but oversteering and the physics system is a bit different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You race on\u00a0an expansive racing level with many shortcuts you can find and use to get\u00a0<strong><em>the lowest time\u00a0</em></strong>and get to the end quickly.</p>\n<p>The game also contains modifiers which make the game harder and some give you a more racing to enjoy!</p>\n<p>The ghosts which race alongside you can be created by saving your races after they finish. These ghosts can then be played against when you race again and as they are saved as individual files, can be\u00a0<strong>shared</strong> between friends!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy as I have worked hard on this and have created everything other than some decorative models!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T13:38:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efa/efaa93ad6093685ddeab624168203a9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamingTortoise"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
