{"id": 79893, "slug": "frostfire", "name": "Frostfire", "name_original": "Frostfire", "description": "Frostfire is an abstract match-3 puzzle game combining both new and familiar mechanics to create deeper gameplay.<br/><br/>To reach a higher score you need to match three or more similar chips (of the same element, fire or frost, and the same level), merging them into a single chip of the next level. You can move a chip by tapping it and then tapping its destination, provided that there is an unblocked path between these two locations. There are six levels of chips; the higher the level of matched chips, the more points you get. Merging three or more chips of the highest level (of any element) produces the final unremovable chip - Frostfire.<br/><br/>Each new game is played on a randomly generated hexagonal board, making the game less repeatable and sometimes more difficult.<br/><br/>Music by Robert Dooley.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T03:26:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea7/ea718f46bdf67f04416e1c2be271dc20.jpg", "website": "https://watabou.itch.io/frostfire", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Oleg Dolya"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Oleg Dolya"], "esrb_rating": null}
