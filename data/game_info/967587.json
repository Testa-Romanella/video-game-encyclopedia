Let's rush into the gate before the time limit runs out.<br/>\r\nOnce you enter the gate, you can \"enhance\" your Rose Doll by shopping with tokens. You may be able to improve your ball attack and bullet attack power, or learn new skills.<br/>\r\nLet's aim for the top floor of the labyrinth while repeating defeating enemies and strengthening Rose Doll! The boss is waiting on the 30th floor, the top floor.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes to go around the labyrinth.
