I personally would describe the game as a\u00a0Metroidvania-Shoot-'em-up-Bullet-Hell. The key feature of the game is the \"node board\" where you can change the functionality of you standard attack and you overall playstyle. Have fun\u00a0experimenting with different node combinations and crashing the game in curious ways.</p>\n<p>Move: W, A, S, D</p>\n<p>Dash: Space</p>\n<p>Interact with E</p>\n<p>Nodeboard: (open it with \"Open/Close\")</p>\n<p>Place a Node by clicking the to the node you want to place related button and afterwards the desired position</p>\n<p>Rotate a node by holding left click and pressing R</p>\n<p>Delete a node from the board by holding left click and pressing F</p>\n<p>Every Node has to be placed in a \u00a0way that there is a predecessor pointing at it. Beginning with the \"Start-Node\" every effect gets stepwise in order accumulated and evaluated. The \"Starte-Node\" has 4 paths which get evaluated in the order: right, up, left, down. Note that one node can be present in all of the four paths so you can make one node count up to four times.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T17:42:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91d5d8f70db34d910cc917d53d23a3fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zerschnetzloar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
