I just wanted something in time for yuri game jam 2020 :). So that means the writing and pacing may be off since I was focused more on the mechanics so just be aware.</p>\r\nThe main character\r\n\r\nThe Love Interests\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\nThe side Love interests\r\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>interactive date/map system: </strong>go on dates where you can talk,touch and do stuff with your date.\u00a0 choose from many different destations for your date to go to.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>working phone</strong>: go on crygram and earn new stories to read based on which route you're in or the choices you made. change your wallpaper and call people.</p>\n<p><strong>Gifting system:\u00a0</strong>buy and gifts for your cryptid\u00a0 and give them to them when on dates<br/></p>\r\nfeatures to be(Unfinished):\r\n<p><strong>animated sprites and cgs:</strong>\u00a0all sprites are animated along with certain backgrounds and Cgs</p>\n<p><strong>job system:</strong> \u00a0Earn money at your dating agency job finding clients their soulmate, play minigames, and raise your stats to get raises so you have money to go on more dates, upgrade your house, and buy gifts</p>\n<p><strong>updated dating system: </strong>where you can date (almost) any of the main NPCs in the game.\u00a0Planning on having dating minigames(such as you making dinner and getting your house ready for a date).</p>\n<p><strong>ending tarcker/achivemnts: </strong>If you check you can see the outline of this in the game. in the future, you will be able to see all your endings you got(As that was a problem in my last game) with the ability to gain achievements along the way</p>\n<p><strong>other:</strong>\u00a0 upgrading /decorating your house and maybe a dress-up system.\u00a0 But these are way low on the list and may or may not make it .</p>\n<p><strong><em>disclaimer:</em></strong></p>\n<p>I wouldn't really call this a demo but more of a proof of concept for yuri game jam 2020 so everything here is not set in stone. backgrounds and sprites may change and new features may be added. this game is in very early pre-alpha stages.<strong><em>\u00a0I am a one dev person team, everything is made by me. the art, coding, and the writing with no budget so please keep that in mind.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Content warning:</strong></em></p>\n<p>righ now its just\u00a0 body horror and some eye horror</p>\n<p>while the demo may not touch on it this game will include a lot of triggering topics in addition to\u00a0body horror and gore.
