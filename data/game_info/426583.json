I did a lot of playing around and experimenting. By the time I realized I wouldn't have time to turn what I had into a game, I decided to just keep playing and see where I could go with it. This is weird. You can control it, but it isn't a game. As fun as this was to make, I understand completely if you can't bring yourself to enjoy playing it.<br/><br/>Rain SFX:<br/>\"Rain, Moderate, A.wav\" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of Freesound.org</p>\n<p>Background music:<br/>Unsound by Julie Licata<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:04:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2db331c7fa18ada82d10fdeec1a747a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gerald Burke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
