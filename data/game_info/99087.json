You are a Dark Matter Creature, a Damacreat. One of the lowest life forms existing in the vast space of Dark Matter. You have just evolved your first pair of Dark Energy dischargers. Once you learn how to navigate, you will have a better chance at surviving in the hostile environment that is Dark Matter.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's eat or be eaten. Survive! Grow! Dominate! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tOr so it should be. Luckily for you, God only had two days to create the Damacreats. And you are the first and only prototype with a digestive system. So it's just eat! Eat! EAT!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b2/0b2dd10ddb6f24d533cd554ca02f6ae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KayZ Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
