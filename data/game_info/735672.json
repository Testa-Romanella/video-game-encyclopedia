In each level search for three files by listening to the broken sounds\u00a0they make and locating them with the use of your hearing, considering the sound's volume, direction etc. In some levels there are antivirus programs that will reset the level for you when met. They communicate with each other by emitting their own distinct sound.</p>\n<p>This game is my tribute to digital aesthetics, glitch music and the beauty of broken media.</p>\n<p>Made as part of Indie Games studio course at Bezalel Academy's visual communication department.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Music used:</p>\n<p>Oval - Do While <strong>\u2318</strong>X</p>\n<p>Ryoji Ikeda - Data.Reflex</p>\n<p>Ryoji Ikeda - Data.Matrix</p>\n<p>Tetsu Inoue &amp; Taylor Deupree - Active/Freeze</p>\n<p>Tetsu Inoue - DSP Terminal<br/></p>\n<p>Mokira - Album 5</p>\n<p>Radiohead - MD126</p>\n<p>Richard Chartier - Fop</p>\n<p>Richard Chartier\u00a0&amp; Taylor Deupree - Specification.Eleven</p>\n<p>Richard Chartier\u00a0&amp; Taylor Deupree\u00a0- Specification.Fourteen</p>\n<p>Additional sounds by me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T06:47:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/983/983c638a38decc7df7397689f74ca0fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Maor Freedman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
