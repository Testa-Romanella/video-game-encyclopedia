But, it's not as easy as you may think! As you approach a wall, it's your job to press a key on your keyboard, that is indicated on the wall, to shapeshift.\u00a0Each time you pass through a wall your score increases. How high can you score? Will you be able to reach 100 and more?</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hole Dash is a fun little game I made 1 day before the end of the third Brackey's game\u00a0jam. There might be bugs, so beware. I might continue to work on this project, I really wanted to add sound or music, but I just didn't have enough time.\u00a0\u00a0If you had at least some amount of fun and want me to work on the game more, please do tell me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:06:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c1/8c1aaeed056ca27e7bd57972ba19d6ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dima_bogov"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
