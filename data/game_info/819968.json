Attacking will deal damage to all enemies based on your ATK dice roll, while defending will reduce damage taken for the next 3 turns by an amount based on your DEF dice roll. You successfully escape if your SPD dice roll is greater than your opponents, however escaping will not grant bonuses for killing the foes.</p>\n<p>By collecting coins you can buy higher-numbered dice, or you can find potions around the dungeon. Potions grant boosts during combat, where your dice roll will have an amount added onto it. There are 4 enemy types with varying amounts of health and movement speeds.</p>\r\nASSETS USED:\r\n<ul><li>Kenny Board\u00a0Game Icons -\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/assets/board-game-icons</li><li>Hamzalopode's Dungeon Crawler Tileset -\u00a0https://hamzalopode.itch.io/dungeon-crawler-tileset</li><li>\"8bit Dungeon Boss\" and \"8bit Dungeon Level\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li><li>\"game over\" by\u00a0Leszek_Szary\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Leszek_Szary/sounds/133283/</li><li>\"Electro win sound\" by\u00a0Unlistenable https://freesound.org/people/Unlistenable/sounds/391539/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T21:36:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cba/cba32694b5dc0cc17a32bea6913c86be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donian"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
