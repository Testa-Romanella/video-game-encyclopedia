When you see your time played it means that you have beaten/completed the game. The title of the game was randomly thought of and so that is the reason why the game might not resemble what is been shown when playing the game, the only execuse I came up with would be that the player shoots blossoms at enemies...<br/></strong></p><p><strong>The game might have bugs and was more intended for playing the executable file instead of playing from the browser. Game can be completed within 2 minutes depending on if you know how to play. 8 weeks was spent on this project, game at least took 4 weeks to complete.\r\n</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/825/82570080c6d9435ac7f3ccbd1c88e8d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Snafuwo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
