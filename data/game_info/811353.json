I JUST REMAKE IT, THIS IS NOT THE REAL VERSION. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE ORIGINAL THEN GOTO THIS LINK:\u00a0https://store.steampowered.com/app/1065520/Autobahn_Police_Simulator_3<br/>Autobahn Police Simulator 3 lets you play as a\u00a0<strong>rookie officer</strong>\u00a0who just resumed their position after a serious car accident left them incapacitated for a while. Work diligently and take on missions to become a capable police officer and keep the<strong>\u00a0autobahn safe</strong>. You are a rookie police officer and it\u2019s your first day back at the station after a car\u00a0<strong>accident involving</strong>\u00a0an illegal car race left you out of commission for quite some time. But now you are back in uniform and ready for duty, so there is no time to waste while<strong>\u00a0sitting behind a desk</strong>. You and your partner get right behind the steering wheel of the police car to get you back up on the basics of<strong>\u00a0police work</strong>, eager to prove yourself to the police station and to your\u00a0<strong>experienced partner</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in this game for its value as an MMO, I gotta say upfront that I am no expert on MMOs so take my opinion with a grain of salt. That being said, much like a DnD character, your Neverwinter characters are capped at level 20, which you reach rather quickly. Thereafter you only improve via what\u2019s called Boon Points to improve stats in minor ways and your equipment giving you an Equipment Level. There is several campaigns following different in canon plotlines in different regions of the world. They\u2019re all interesting to see and play through and some are more challenging than others. Some are only daily and so you have to leave and come back the next day, but most are rather linear,\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Accidents\r\n</li><li>Traffic checks\r\n</li><li>Car chases\r\n</li><li>Street-Cleaning\r\n</li><li>Police blockade\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Features different types of police cars for a variety of operations\r\n</li><li>Various mission types offering more diverse gameplay experiences\r\n</li><li>Freely explorable map including bigger and smaller cityscapes, industrial sites, highways as well as country roads\r\n</li><li>Improved progression system and tech tree\r\n</li><li>Dynamic traffic system\r\n</li><li>Authentic driving experience of german autobahns</li></ul>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n<ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system\r\n</li><li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 64-bits\r\n</li><li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core\u00a0i5-2500K@3.3GHz\u00a0or AMD FX\u00a06300@3.5GHz\r\n</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM\r\n</li><li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 ti (3 GB) or AMD Radeon R9 570 (4GB)\r\n</li><li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12 (you can download it here:\u00a0https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35.
