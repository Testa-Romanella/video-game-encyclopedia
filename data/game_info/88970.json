My latest effort, Grandpa\u2019s VCR, is an idea I began over 13 years ago while working at Crude Games, a microscopic iPhone app company.  <br/><br/>Through the years, the game has evolved and grown with new ideas and puzzles, all of which reference my childhood in the 1980\u2019s and 90\u2019s, a pivotal time of tech and pop culture for me.  <br/><br/>(And honestly, to say this game was inspired by \u201cReady Player One\u201d is an understatement of ginormous proportions. I heart you, Ernest Cline!)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T17:32:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f20/f2003b3ebc72ad985fcf55bc0eb94b17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Opie Productions"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Opie Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
