{"id": 597, "slug": "edge", "name": "Edge", "name_original": "Edge", "description": "<p>Edge is an isometric puzzle platformer. You control a cube and need to lead it through levels to the goal, collecting light prisms and trying not to fall off the map. You see the map from the isometric perspective, and the cube moves diagonally. There are 45 main and 3 unlockable levels in the game. </p>\n<p>The key feature of the gameplay is the ability of the cube to balance at the certain angle. You need this to complete the most difficult parts of the route. When rolling is not enough, you can climb a moving block to overcome an obstacle or perform any other maneuver. However, these tricks are not easy to master.</p>\n<p>However, Edge challenges your reflexes more than your ability to solve puzzles. The game usually gives direct hints about where to go and what to do to pass the level but it\u2019s quite difficult to perform this safely. Problems can appear only with collecting all the prisms as they can be hidden. In general, the entire game is created in simple polygonal style so nothing distracts you from completing levels.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2008-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-20T13:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/601/60141c5480a9ccec225c16d5ff5216e6.jpg", "website": "http://2trib.es/edge", "rating": 3.58, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 54, "owned": 1429, "beaten": 81, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 71, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 47, "ratings_count": 155, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 157, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS", "Wii U", "macOS", "PlayStation 3", "PSP", "Android", "PC", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["Two Tribes", "Kanawati", "Mobigame", "Mobigame S.A.R.L."], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Two Tribes Publishing", "Kanawati", "Mobigame"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
