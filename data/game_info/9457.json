The game is a part of America\u2019s Army series. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player performs as an infantryman, a part of a Long Range Combined Arms \u2013 Recon unit. The plot is based on the U.S. intervention in the Ostregal Islands as a call for defending the RDO Government which was struck by the Czervenians. The U.S. forces landed on the Islands to engage in police action and reconnaissance operations. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>This is a classic first eye tactical shooter. The player is given certain tasks to perform as a part of the unit.<br />\nThe aim is to stay alive in campaigns and fulfill each task. It is possible to change the character\u2019s appearance even though the customization system is quite small. There are a few weapons including M4, M16, standard sniper rifle and shotgun. Maps are not too huge which makes it easier to go through a match. The maps vary in landscapes and size. Each one provides its benefits: it is possible to hide behind the trees in the forest mode or hole upon the earth in the field. The player is free to choose the very own tactics, be it the perfect stealth, merging in the terrain, or be it the classic get-through shooting campaign. The gameplay includes medical help; if the player is injured, it is possible to bandage yourself or wait for help.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T00:50:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1c3/1c3bcb76d03f320824ea7638cddddb6c.jpg", "website": "http://americasarmy.com/aapg", "rating": 2.63, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 55, "owned": 1284, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 46, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 101, "ratings_count": 86, "suggestions_count": 604, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 86, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["U.S Army", "U.S. Army", "US ARMY - ARMY GAME STUDIO"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["U.S Army", "U.S. Army"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
