Get ready to start a new fair Dinkum life and build a home on an Island inspired by the wild Australian outback. Explore tropical eucalyptus forests, survive scorching deserts, relax at cool billabongs and discover scrubland filled with adorable Aussie inspired wildlife. Collect valuable resources by hunting, mining, fishing and foraging to expand and customise your town and attract new townsfolk and businesses. Share your new home with friends and protect each other as you explore beautiful landscapes filled with dangerous predators.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Go from starting out sleeping in a swag under the stars, to a sprawling town with farms, businesses and attractions. Eventually, you\u2019ll draw in visitors, who might decide to stay and make it their home too.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Keep your neighbours happy by customising your town with fences, flower beds, street lamps, beehives, windmills, hedges, fountains and more. The happier your townsfolk are the more likely they are to settle down, bring their families and set up stores with unique items.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>Invite your friends to visit your town where they can help you construct buildings, shop at your stores, go fishing, race Emus, fight crocodiles much more!<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>The island is Choc-A-Bloc with insects, fish and minerals. So grab your thongs and go track down and collect them all for your personal museum collection, or sell them for a tidy profit!<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>Care for and breed chickens, cows and sheep as well as Dinkum\u2019s iconic Giant Wombats! The Wombats might seem intimidating at first, but really they are sweethearts.<br/><br/>Cultivate crops for your town across the whole island, choosing the best spots for each type. Not only do the seasons change, but the temperature shifts depending on where you are on the island<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>Hunt animals for food and defend yourself from deadly predators who are just as hungry as you. Those Roos might seem friendly but they pack a punch!<br/><br/>Attack creatures head on or capture them with traps, it\u2019s up to you how to survive.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Customise your character in Dinkum to be the True Blue version of you. Buy that shiny pair of sunnies or wide Akubra hat in the shop, or seek out rare items through exploring the great outdoors and through chinwags with fellow townsfolk.<br/><br/>Make your house your own cosy abode. Craft a huge range of furniture and decorations, choose where everything goes and invite friends over to show off your interior designer creds.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-10T11:09:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bce9bbfd4c49fcc6f65e39ed2efeff07.jpg", "website": "http://www.playdinkum.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 217, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 9, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 457, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Bendon"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Irregular"], "esrb_rating": null}
