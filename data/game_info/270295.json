The game is a Co-op, rogue-like, twin-stick shooter. Set in a Steampunk Victorian London, the narrative is set in a timeline where Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace came together to complete their\u00a0Analytical Engine. This machine sparks a steampunk revolution and changes the course of history. The Analytical Engine is used to create the\u00a0autonomous\u00a0clockwork robots\u00a0the COG Twins. Once they have been created Babbage is kidnapped and forced to create an army of mechanical creatures that have been used to overthrow the\u00a0London\u00a0government and hand control to a single man known only as 'The Gentleman'. The Cog twins much fight through procedurally\u00a0generated\u00a0\u00a0streets of London, with their arsenal of randomly generated weapons to save London and get their creator back.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03a0f215a7774d93bc709bb54c8d5ccb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grant Mullock"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
