So make sure the newest and/or least likeable friend is the one you team up against!<br/><em>(No worries hated friend. The game will lend you the power you always desired to blast\u00a0your so-called\u00a0\"friends\" into the ground!)</em></p>\n<p>Three heroes will fight the mighty boss and it\u2019s your goal to destroy the other team.\u00a0Seriously, smash them!<br/></p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>The game is currently in <strong>Alpha</strong> and therefore\u00a0represents a very early stage in development!\u00a0Pretty much nothing is final at this stage.\u00a0</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>We\u00a0<strong>WILL</strong>\u00a0actively\u00a0work on the game and bring substantial updates over the course of the next months!
