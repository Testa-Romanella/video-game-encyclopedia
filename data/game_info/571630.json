That's a shame, because the intention is to have the character in the other cell talk with you, and give you hints. He's been there a long time, and has seen a lot. He doesn't seem nearly as surprised as you do to suddenly materialize in a cage in some dark void. Where the heck are you??? The way out, you'll learn from your fellow prisoner, is right through that centre door. He also hints that the<strong> iron cage appears to be quite fatigued</strong> - maybe someone young like you can push her way out?</p>\n<p>Playable on Windows PC with gamepad, keyboard, or in VR. To play in VR, connect your VR device to your PC before launching the executable.\u00a0VR only play tested with Oculus Quest via Link.</p>\n<ul><li>Gamepad Control:<br/><em>Movement</em>: Left Joystick<br/>\n<em>Sprint</em>: Press Left Joystick\r\n<br/>\n<em>Jump</em>: A (south button)<br/><em>Camera pan/tilt:</em> Right Joystick (press to recentre)</li><li>Keyboard Control:<br/>\n<em>Movement</em>: ASDW or cursor/arrow keys\r\n<br/>\n<em>Sprint</em>: Hold Shift\r\n<br/>\n<em>Jump</em>: Space Bar<br/><em>Camera pan/tilt:</em> Numaric Keypad (5 to recentre)</li><li>VR/XR Controllers:<br/><em>Movement</em>: Joystick\u00a0on either controller<br/>\n<em>Sprint</em>: Press Joystick on either controller\r\n<br/>\n<em>Jump</em>: Primary Button on either controller</li></ul>\n<p>This uses the following assets:</p>\n<ul><li>SyntyStudios (mostly Dungeon, some Vikings and Knights too)</li><li>Malbers\u00a0Animations Animal Controller/HAP</li><li>Music \"Reset\" by Michael Vignola, available from Artlist.io</li></ul>\n<p>To come:</p>\n<ul><li>dialog system</li><li>further development of the level design</li><li>enemies?</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T10:17:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e6/0e64019139a19d3232a8247abc04f9fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HeyBishop"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
