You can re read chapters to see if you can get a better outcome.<br />\nThere are a bunch of options to try to make the game easier to play based on peoples common conceptions on what fixes dyslexia.<br />\nThere is an option to add a colored overlay and remove the flicker in an attempt to combat &quot;Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome/ Irlen Syndrome&quot;.<br />\nAnd there is an option to change the front to Open Dyslexic which in my opinion is harder to read.<br />\nThere are options which allow you to play the game in non dyslexic mode if you want, but wheres the fun in that.<br />\nWe don&#39;t claim to be actually like what a dyslexic persons sees, but merely a simulation of the frustration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T14:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25dac649a2f6169df9a70c55e49a854f.jpg", "website": "http://lowtek.co.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wallmasterr", "Alastair Low"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lowtek Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
