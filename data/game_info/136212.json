There are three different levels and the first player who accumulate three victorys wins.</p><p>ShootingPlates is a 2-players game where the goal is to score by shooting on the flying plates. If the player hit the center of the plate they get a higher score. By the end of the waves, the player with the highest score wins.</p><p>On both games players need to use controllers with analog sticks to play them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff5b3c78bffa95dfe9ef6d68c339bd0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LotusOregano"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
