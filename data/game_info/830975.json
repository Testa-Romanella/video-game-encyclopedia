Use arrow keys to move left and right, including jumping with up arrow. In normal mode,\u00a0you can't let the cats hit the ground, but if you get hit by a stork or a baby, you will die. In easy mode, Cats can hit the ground, but if they hit spikes or leave the screen, you lose a heart. Babies and spikes still insta-kill you.\u00a0If your score reaches 999900 (cats are 100 points each), you will get a special secret screen! That's about it! All music and sprites by me, and the font is Futile Pro by Eeve Somepx at somepx.itch.io. I hope you have fun, and although this game is free, I highly ask that you donate so that I can someday get a better pc to make better games. -Stygian Hero</p><p>Please note that windows version does not have \"quick start\" feature.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T13:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b27d32180d7da55942463478e1c9f8cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Drunk Puppy"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
