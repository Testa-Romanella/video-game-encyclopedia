In sprint three, I have updated from basic shapes to a combination of shapes. These shapes are no longer static, and each variation has a dynamic aspect to it. The user can change the speed of the animation of each object set or have it set to randomly select the speed. The user also has a toggle option that will randomize the animation each shape takes, or they can pick from a drop-down menu. Previous attributes like the glow or opacity of objects is still available so the user can change it on the fly.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T04:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2a/e2a13f8c689f10a7cca60fd7ab6aa23f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["manuelavila"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
