Like any good JRPG protagonist, our Hiro will gather a band of heroes and misfits to his cause, save a few lives and complete a couple errands along the way (Those cats won\u2019t walk themselves!). And while our Hiro may not be the sharpest sword in the armory, his adventure savvy intuition grants him an uncanny knack for getting out of (and into) all sorts of crazy situations. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFriends in tow, and determination unyielding, our hero may just have what it takes to save the kingdom...or screw things up beyond recognition.    <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Feature List in Brief:<br/>\r\n--  Active Time Battle System<br/>\r\n--  Humorous and Quirky Storyline<br/>\r\n--  Challenging Puzzle Dungeons<br/>\r\n--  Step Based Encounter System<br/>\r\n--  Tension Based Energy Management System<br/>\r\n--  Classic RPG Play Paradigm<br/>\r\n-- Lots of Math Jokes and Wordplay", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T03:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cb7b7c6b6525014861323631185c0a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vernacular Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Vernacular Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
