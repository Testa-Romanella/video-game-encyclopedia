The theme for this year's jam is Rotation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, the only direct control you have over your character is adjusting their rotation via the arrow keys. You cannot control when the bunny will launch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each level your bunny starts with a certain number of boosts, represented by carrots. Collecting another carrot will add another boost. The object of the game is to collect as many coins as is possible before running out of boosts. At any time during a level you may press Enter to reset the level and try it again. There's five levels to play.</p>\n<p>There is no penalty for pressing Enter and restarting a level as many times as you want, so don't be afraid to reset and try again as you figure out ways to improve your run. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T17:13:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/5496ff0b615c81462041fb54f1a56093.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tracfacsam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
