{"id": 540637, "slug": "blue-sunshine", "name": "Blue Sunshine", "name_original": "Blue Sunshine", "description": "<p>A futuristic game where you control a robot and must complete tasks without being killed by the others robots.</p>\n<p>Choose between 12 weapons, from a small silent gun to a rocket launcher able to dig holes through the toughest walls.</p>\n<p>Stay out of the path of your enemies and stay clear of the vision field of the CCTV. If you need to get rid of a foe, be silent, or at least close the doors 'cause their acolytes will hear you and come to check it out.</p>\n<p>You finished the game? Then you can create your own maps thanks to the Map Editor included with the game: add destructible walls and low-walls, lockable doors, rotating CCTV and define the objectives of the mission. Then arm the robots, connect them to CCTV and teammates so they can call for help and let them know where they must patrol.<br/></p>\n<p>'cause it's the future there is not a single picture in the game, everything you see is vector. As you can't see your enemies through walls, you should use a headset to hear from where does the shots comes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T05:24:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02f38049efa6231a11e8ef5e3fc38e75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["terencem"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
