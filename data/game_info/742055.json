If too many are open at the same time or your health drops to 0 it's game over. Some special pop-ups can affect you in positive or negative ways.</p>\n<p>Jorge Pons Asensio - Game design and programming -\u00a0https://twitter.com/TCLDrawings<br/>Rodrigo Gil Manrique - Visual design and pixel art\u00a0-\u00a0https://twitter.com/rgilm_</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>WASD - Move<br/>Shift - Move slowly<br/>Left Click - Close or accept pop-ups</p>\n\n<p>Sound effect and music credits:</p>\n<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/GameAudio/sounds/220173</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/BloodPixelHero/sounds/572936/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/FoolBoyMedia/sounds/352667/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/tutarap/sounds/366007/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/magnuswaker/sounds/592573/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Klerrp/sounds/143222/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/TheBuilder15/sounds/415763/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Autistic%20Lucario/sounds/142608/</li><li>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Redacted_Chiptune_Forum/Hello_World/Prism_Sta...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T05:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6f/f6f5d6868dccd6b5d347d5f7688b6579.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jorge", "Rodrigo Gil"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
