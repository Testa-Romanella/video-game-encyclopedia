Over the summer I have the goal to make one small game every week, to better my Unity skills.\u00a0 ~</p>\n<p><strong>Welcome to Block Party!\u00a0Play with a Friend on the Same Device.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0News of an assassin in town has been spread to the police, one night before the annual Block Party. This is the biggest party of the year, with all triangles, circles and squares attending. In fear of the safety of this party a secret agent has been sent out to catch the assassin. But upon arrival, the agent realized the vast population of the party, and he would have to use every clue to his advantage to find the assassin before too many victims would be taken.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>One person plays as the assassin, and the other plays as the police. The assassins goal is to kill five people at the party. The polices goal is to find and arrest the assassin. The police only has one arrest, so if he arrests the wrong person the assassin wins. As the police, find clues like when a person disappears or unusual movement to find the assassin.\u00a0<em>At the beginning\u00a0of the round, the police has to look away for two seconds, that way the assassin\u00a0will know who she/he is. They will be highlighted\u00a0in red.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Assassin uses \"WASD\" to move and \"Q\" to assassinate. Police uses Arrow Keys to move and \"Right Shift\" to arrest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T04:31:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83f/83f23256e700646f47067eda26364505.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stmc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
