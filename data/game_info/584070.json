The sounds and visuals of that game are still etched in my mind all these decades later.\r\n</p>\n<p>I recently became immersed in the world of\u00a0<strong>Mattel Aquarius</strong>, a decidedly underpowered discount\u00a0home computer system from 1983 that existed for mere months before being phased out. The lack of a dedicated graphics chip or programmable characters make this computer, in many ways, less programmable\u00a0than the 2600 released six years prior.\r\n</p>\n<p>Despite its shortcomings, I still find charm in the system. The old adage \"limitations foster creativity\" rings especially true for this platform. There still exists a small but passionate community of like-minded individuals who are\u00a0taking the system to new levels with fresh software and hardware modifications.\r\n</p>\n<p>To pay homage to the classic space shooter of my youth, while also celebrating the 10th anniversary of BASIC 10 Liner\u00a0and my newfound admiration of Aquarius, I decided to develop the aptly\u00a0titled\u00a0<strong>Cosmic Aq</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are some agonizing challenges in working for this platform especially within the scope of a 10 liner. Most notably,\u00a0 each line can be a maximum of 72 characters and there is no abbreviated syntax for the commands. This gives Aquarius developers a hard limit of 720 characters instead of 800 characters allocated on other platforms in the PUR-80 category.\r\n</p>\n<p>My original high\u00a0ambitions for this project quickly diminished when I\u00a0realized that I was nearing capacity of the code limit just in\u00a0constructing the visuals for the ship and comet, which initially included a much more elegant design as well as\u00a0dust trails and explosion effects. I had to refactor the design endlessly to squeeze enough game mechanics in to consider it a completed project. It is comparable to the meteor shower mode of the original Cosmic Ark.\r\n</p>\n<p>Enjoy!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nTHE CODE\r\n\r\nREM----------------EACH LINE IS 72 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH----------------- 0DIMB(22):D=12747:E=12347:T=50:L=53:M=14346:N=12774:Q=22:R=N:S=243:A=160 1B=1024:?CHR$(11):POKEE-59,46:FORI=0TOQ:Z=3-Z:POKEINT(960*RND(1)+E),46-Z 2READX:B(Q-I)=X:D=D+X*(I&lt;13)*-1:POKED,S+Z:POKED+B,179+Z:SOUND(I,I):NEXTI 3SOUND(Q,S+S*F):IFL=48THENSOUND(Q*2,S*4):?TAB(53)\"SCORE\";:?P:INPUTA$:RUN 4G=INT(2*RND(1)+1)*SGN(RND(1)-0.5):U=E+460*ABS(G-1):H=40*G:K=9:F=2:V=-23 5POKEE+23,L:T=T+(G&lt;=1):C=1-(T&lt;-L):IFABS(G)=2THENU=N+(6.5*ABS(G-2)):H=G/2 6FORI=0TOKSTEPC:V=-V:POKEU+H*I,173+V:W=PEEK(M):O=I:IFW=B(G+2)THENF=1:O=K 7FORJ=0TOT:NEXTJ:R=B(G+7)+N:IFF=01THENPOKE(R),213:POKE(R+B),54:F=0:P=P+1 8POKEU+H*(I),A:I=O:NEXTI:POKE(M),A:POKE(R),A:POKE(R+B),22:IFF=2THENL=L-1 9GOTO3:DATA0,37,1,1,1,1,1,1,36,1,1,39,-498,9,-67,0,133,17,44,97,0,122,46 REM--10--||---20---||---30---||---40---||---50---||---60---||---70---|72 \r\n\r\nMATTEL AQUARIUS\r\n<p>The Mattel Aquarius has a fixed 256 character set and no GPU. It uses early version of Microsoft BASIC\u20141.7K usable RAM. It also only supports a maximum of 72 characters per line. The screen has a 40x24 grid of tile-like characters-16 colors.\r\n</p>\r\nSTORY\r\n<p>The crew's latest interstellar effort aboard \"<strong>Aquarius '83</strong>\"\u00a0 has gone dangerously astray. Caught in a shower of deadly and\u00a0 increasingly violent meteors, the ship has already been hit. Now, it's a hard battle to the end; missiles against meteors!\r\n</p>\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n<p>You control the tattered Aquarius spacecraft, hovering in space and with minimal protection against the meteors. By chance, the ship still has functional four-way missles and these can be fired upward, downward, to the left or right. Use this weaponry to obliterate all the incoming meteors!\r\n</p>\n<p>The game ends when you've been hit more than 5 times. At the end, your score will be shown.
