Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, \u201cThere you go! There you go.\u201d Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, \u201cWe got an [expletive] squad now.\u201d And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, \u201cY\u2019all look so different.\u201d\r\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,\u201d James said. \u201cI know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that\u2019s my mindset.\u201d", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:40:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d3259fc467071e1914509f1ee5b22d95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["diggydog233"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
