The project guidelines were \"There must be a lock and a key.\" Our take on that was that you <em>are</em> the key, and you must find the lock you belong to.</p>\n<p>All of the controls are listed in the game. All of the programming was done by me.</p>\n<p>There are 3 separate locks that you must complete in order, the general area for each lock\u00a0is marked by an exclamation point.</p>\n<p>This project was a very good learning experience, and the group who created it is debating on whether to continue it or not. Let me know in the comments if you're interested in seeing this game progress!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T02:25:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff4/ff470cf036c7868d6af64bb6572a561b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brad Musselman"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
