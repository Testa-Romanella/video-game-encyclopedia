It has been created for the Diploma in Games  Programming at the SAE Institute in Munich.\r\n    </p>\n<p>It was a Solo Project and should include a lot of Physical Interaction. My idea was to fire a Projectile out of a Gun and the Simulation revolves around the Physical interaction of this bullett with other objects.
