Now just think up some clich\u00e9s, draw some crappy trees and make enough money to pay this week's rent. Pro tip: Better posters will get you more money, but take more time to make.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Everything's done using the \"z\" and \"x\" keys. The menus are self-explanatory, in the levels you can tap \"z\" to attack to the left and tap \"x\" to attack to the right. Pressing both at the same time will perform a dodge, holding a key might make you move in that direction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jam</strong><br/>This game is part of the\u00a0Mini Jam 34. It was made in about two days, so a lot of stuff was not implemented. The core gameplay is still pretty solid. That jam is also where the terrible two-button control scheme came from.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28f/28fa67f3df12d5f7ebde6cbbada1d480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Brain in a Bowl"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
