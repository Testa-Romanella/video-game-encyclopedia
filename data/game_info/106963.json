As you guide Jackin through the story you'll be faced with decisions to make - who to talk to, who to trust? While this demo is just a snippet of the story, you'll eventually choose between marrying the new Queen, or siding with the dissidents and supporting the revolution.<br/><br/>The demo features animated sprites, a custom soundtrack, and an all Australian voice cast. We're really proud of how it looks and sounds, but in order to finish the game to this same level of polish we're going to need further funding.
