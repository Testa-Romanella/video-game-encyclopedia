{"id": 686623, "slug": "able-2", "name": "Able", "name_original": "Able", "description": "<p>\"Able\" is a challenging, physics-based puzzle game where your task is to climb to the top using only the strength of your arms.</p>\n<p>Use Q, W, O, and P to control the arms (Q/P to grab and let go; W/O to pull yourself up).<br/></p>\n<p>Starter tip: Press Q and P together to grab on to both sides of the shaft, then press and hold W and O together to hoist yourself up. Try building up some momentum before you let go!</p>\n<p>Inspired by games such as QWOP, Getting over it, and GIRP.</p>\n<p>Please note that being a #LudwigJam game, the game is fairly short. My PB is currently 5 minutes and 52 seconds. A new player could get stuck for a few hours, though!</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The art in this game is admittedly rather minimalist. However, I put a lot of effort into the gameplay, level design, and programming, so hopefully you will still give it a try.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T11:54:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a2/5a2abc53bf0eca8cbf5ada719b24918e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vegard"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
