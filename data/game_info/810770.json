Experts are examining the footage, filmed by a local farmer, in the hope that sceptical eyes may reveal what the farmer describes as an \"encounter\". Is it a drone? Faked? Experimental military craft? Or a power generated by the stones themselves? <strong>Play to find out.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Strange</strong> <strong>and mysterious</strong> <strong>sightings </strong>have been reported at the ancient stone circle at Duloe, Cornwall, in the far South West of Great Britain.
