One person is in the virtual world, discovering the landscape of a huge face. The other person can control some aspects of the virtual world, with her/his facial expressions.</p>\n<p>If you are in VR you can use the controllers to teleport on the head. \u00a0I like hanging out in the eyebrows, in the hair, and you can see some tears coming, if your friend outside of VR blinks enough.</p>\n<p>If you are out of VR, if you close your eyes, it will become night in the virtual world, if you open your mouth, wind starts blowing and if you blink 3, tears start appearing.</p>\n\n<p>I did this project at the School of Machines, Making &amp; Make-Believe in Berlin.\u00a0Thanks for the help to our fantastic teacher, Chris Sugrue! And for the person who made the FaceOSC app!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9d3e79b4d95adcf8841b182ddd89e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rita.cloud"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
