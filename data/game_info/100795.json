Some mischievous hamsters have challenged the Spring Hare, a bunny with a spring suit, to a game. The hamsters will give the hare a new rule every few seconds, and you must help her stick to them. From avoiding bugs to outlawing jumping above a certain height, the rodents are very crafty in their restrictions. But, with your help, the hare will prevail!</p>\n<p>What's the highest level you can reach?</p>\n<p>You can use a gamepad or keyboard! Charge your spring with the A button, up arrow or W key, and release to jump. While in the air, move with the left stick, left and right arrows, or A and D keys.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
