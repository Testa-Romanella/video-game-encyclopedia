Warriors and Refugees take to their boats in search of lands that are safe, where they can recoup and regather.</p>\n<p>This is one of those safe harbours. As you accept a risky group of refugees into your midst, can you find a way to trust them and to prepare for the fish men by building defenses?</p>\n<p>Instructions</p>\n<p>- Basic game flow is: with each villager, build something and assign them to hammer it. When they all have jobs, end the day at the top right and watch as they are completed by the next day.</p>\n<p>- There is no conclusion, just building a few things day by day until you are happy with how the village looks.</p>\n<p>- Press ESCAPE for a quick summary of controls</p>\n<p>- there is a slightly more up to date version at this dropbox link.

If a character gets stuck trying to build, the building will usually still build.</p>\n<p>- the buildings when being placed will fly at you sometimes.
