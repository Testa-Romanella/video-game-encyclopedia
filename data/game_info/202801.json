The game starts off easy, but you keep getting faster and faster, enemies are spawned at certain scores, and more of them spawn towards the end. At the point of nearly having won you will be incredibly fast and lots of enemies will be spawning from points.\u00a0 And the more time you take, the faster you get. The more time you take to find that next point, the more enemies will be spawned. It's quite literally Inpossible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f0/4f008d63ea0c9edf7c4fd764445bd87e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Days8"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
