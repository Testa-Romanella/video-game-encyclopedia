With use of just basic geometries, it utilizes the physics engine to create a domino that I tried to\u00a0spell \"hi\" at the end.\u00a0\u00a0I tried integrating color, physic material (bounciness), rigid bodies, and constrains. It was a challenging first exercise but I hope to improve with the coming weeks! Build is available on Windows/iOS/WebGL.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T07:46:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8d/f8dfd06bd7fc3d5fed2b68f9265fb6e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["ybae"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
