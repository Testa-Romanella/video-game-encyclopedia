{"id": 516903, "slug": "air-drop-farm", "name": "Air Drop Farm", "name_original": "Air Drop Farm", "description": "Hey, you new farmer, its up to you to make a great farm!\r\n\u2022 Follow the tutorial to learn how to grow crops and complete contracts.\r\n  \r\n\u2022 Use the radio to claim mystery animals to fill your farm with life and generate some extra passively earnt cash.\r\n  \r\n\u2022 Spend money by using the radio to buy airdrops to decorate your land.\r\n  \r\n\u2022 Make the best farm you can and submit a picture here/on Twitter it to compete on being the best master farmer.\r\n\r\nNotes for playing\r\n\u2022 If an item ever guys stuck, for example if it airdrops on top of a tree, it will teleport to your helipad so you can retrieve it. Check there if anything goes missing.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u2022 Make sure to take pictures of your final farm!\r\nWhy it was built\r\n<p>The game was made for the Audio Mob game jam, AuidoMob is looking for game developers to use their plugin which implements audio adverts into Unity. This is why audio banner ads are implemented in a new way which is an instant reward system, you listen to an ad while you claim your new Air Drop. In future I may expand the game to include more animals, crops, construction and customization as well as a save system.\u00a0Made for phone, but can be played on PC</p>\n<p>Playable on Android and PC! In future I plan to create a proper PC port. For now you can play the android version on pc, but the controls and UI and made for mobile so the pc version feels a bit more like a prototype.</p>\r\nFuture Goals\r\n<p>In future if I were to expand this to a full game there are many options for expansion, such as farmer customization, house building, more crops and animals, I could even program it from the ground up and make it co-op multiplayer. With the contract and Air Drop system there is room for a lot of content.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy the game, to the right you will see some pictures sent and quotes sent in from master farmers, remember to submit yours below!</p>\r\nMusic used:\r\nFiddles McGinty by Kevin MacLeod\r\nRiver Valley Breakdown by Kevin MacLeod\r\nMaster of the Feast by Kevin MacLeod\r\nStill Pickin by Kevin MacLeod\r\nAchaidh Cheide by Kevin MacLeod\r\nFolk Round by Kevin MacLeod\r\nPippin the Hunchback by Kevin MacLeod\r\nLicense:\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\r\nLink:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io\r\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/TobyAtkinsGames</p>\r\nRelease Day\u00a0Trailer:\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Teaser Announcement Video:", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a1/7a131c486a47f1e69820655dea9eb428.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toby"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
