At the end of the game, players only count Lifestyle cards that their Social Score will support. <br/><br/>Players use the NOSEDIVE component app during the game to give each other various types of Experiences. They then rate those experiences within the app, and those rating either raise or lower the giver\u2019s Social Score. The NOSEDIVE app also tracks each player\u2019s Social Score throughout the game, which directly affects the scoring of the physical Lifestyle cards at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Language: English<br/><br/>The Black Mirror episode \u2018Nosedive\u2019, as well as the storyline, script and graphics/artworks used in the episode are \u00a9 House of Tomorrow.<br/>Black Mirror \u2122 Endemol Shine UK Ltd. \u00a9 2016 House of Tomorrow Ltd.
