The physics of the Ship are realistically simulated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Customize ships with weapons and frames, all of which have different characteristics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Conquering an asteroid and returning it to the owner is a lucrative business. Use what you earn on the field to develop new technologies and purchase new parts, weapons, and items.<br/> <br/>Synopsis:<br/><br/>Year 22xx. No new laws of physics have been discovered that allow for Faster-Than-Light travel. However, the development of Nuclear Propulsion and AI Systems allowed humankind to expand its operations to the entire Solar System.<br/><br/>Asteroid Mining, once not more than a dream for some, is now a reality. AI Systems equipped with Artificial General Intelligence carry out most space operations.<br/><br/>These AI Systems could develop their own objectives, and often Companies lost control of their colonies.<br/><br/>Both Governments, through regulations, and Companies, through engineering efforts, had attempted to create AI Systems capable of carrying out the mining and exploration tasks without developing AGI. All those attempts failed. The resulting systems were either not intelligent enough or managed to develop AGI over time.<br/><br/>When there is a problem financially worth solving, the market responds. Thus, a new type of Company was born with the only task of returning the colonies that went rogue to their human owners.<br/><br/>You work for one of such Companies.<br/><br/>Initially, owning a simple Gunship and few weapons, you'll complete missions and expand your ship capabilities, develop and buy more powerful weapons while uncovering the mystery underlying a surge in machine rebellions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T02:33:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa8/fa8d2c11d9e3e224fc5d25ffe49b5333.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 370, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Game Fabric"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Game Fabric"], "esrb_rating": null}
