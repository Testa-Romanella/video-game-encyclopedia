The primary goal, as in the previous part, for most missions, is the elimination of the enemy unit, however, in the campaign mode, a variety of combat tasks is now available, and the implementation of them is the key to victory. </p>\n<p>The differences between Battlefront II and Battlefront mainly relate to increasing the number of game modes (campaign, galaxy conquest, instant action, challenges and multiplayer), the ability to play for different heroes and villains, the presence of the ability to sprint and to flip ahead. </p>\n<p>Throughout the game, there is a battle between two armies. But the action can be different (it all depends on the selected mode and version of the game). Also in some cases, there is a so-called Fake Console, which allows the player to edit the parameters of the battle on his discretion.  Battles can take place both on the planets themselves and in outer space in the orbit of these planets.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2005-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T22:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/662/6625a20ca1d13699ee7c191b20a02408.jpg", "website": "http://www.swbattlefront2.com", "rating": 4.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 129, "owned": 3395, "beaten": 735, "toplay": 47, "dropped": 274, "playing": 17}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 66, "ratings_count": 815, "suggestions_count": 513, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 823, "platforms": ["Xbox", "PSP", "PlayStation 2", "PC"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "LucasArts Entertainment", "Lucasfilm", "Pandemic Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Disney Interactive", "LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
