Please note that since this project is going to be remade in Game Maker 1.4, it's possible that this demo will not be updated. Regardless, please feel free to leave a comment/review and let me know what you think so far! Links to the RPG Maker MV plugin makers that I used in this demo version are listed in the README file provided with the game.
