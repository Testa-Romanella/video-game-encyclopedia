I had surgery with a general anaesthetic for the first time in my life just before Christmas. This game is my response.<br/><br/>I tried to follow the rules for a flatgame as closely as possible \u2013 to make me work differently. The most striking thing for me is how directly personal it turned out. I had a vague idea of what the game might be about. The graphics were abstract scribbles done in half an hour. The game was put together in about three hours. I'm aware I haven't done anything interesting with space in the game but the focus was very much on the story.<br/><br/>Hope you think it worth your time.<br/><br/>Sound is edited version of file from http://www.freesound.org/people/samfk360/</p><p>N.B.
