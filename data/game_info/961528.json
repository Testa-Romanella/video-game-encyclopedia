It's up to you if you want monsters chasing you or if you want a peaceful experience with no threats.<h3>Customize Your Gameplay</h3>Try playing with VHS graphics or retro style 90's graphics (I know this trope is becoming overdone but it looks cool).<h3>Atmosphere Is Everything</h3>Immerse yourself with a haunting soundtrack of over 15 unsettling dreamcore/weirdcore songs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>A Note From The Developer</strong><br/><br/>Hi! Thanks so much for checking out my game. I think its important to be transparent with the community, so just know that I am plan on adding more content over time with free updates and no microtransactions. This game is currently just a fun little atmospheric walking simulator where you need to find multiple items to escape, hence the cheap price. There is no progression or saving. I am open to adding stuff like this is in the future if the fanbase becomes large enough.
