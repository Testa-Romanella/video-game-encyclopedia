It's quite literally fantasy football.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Manage a team through six rounds of the 'Gobsoc Gauntlet'</li><li>Simplified soccer: no pesky offside, corners,\u00a0or even\u00a0fouls to worry about</li><li>Buy and sell players on the transfer market</li><li>Earn extra gold with unnecessary showboating</li><li>Watch your players brutalize their opponents for no reason</li><li>Use your half-time team talk to cheat your way to victory</li><li>Star player\u00a0killed mid-match? Ghosts can play too!</li><li>Random player generator with over 8 billion permutations</li></ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Inspired by my childhood love of Championship Manager and my adulthood love of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. When you get down to it, the two aren't that different: they're both about analyzing stats and creating stories.\u00a0You nurture a\u00a0group of players, attempt to strategize,\u00a0and then sit back and spectate as the whims of fate decide whether or not your head gets kicked off.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This is a beta release and my first game so please let me know when you inevitably find bugs or balance issues.
