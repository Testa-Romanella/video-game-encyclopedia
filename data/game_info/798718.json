Purpose of the game is for the player to stealthily retrieve the flock whilst\u00a0avoiding the pigs. As you gather more of the flock together it will be harder\u00a0to hide. This provides a test for the player. Also we hope it appeals to the\u00a0age range of 6-9 year old's, but there is no reason people older than that\u00a0can\u2019t play it.<strong> FULL SCREEN RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T14:37:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16d/16d5dd51d5aa33478c257ed7c175d941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Smash-Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
