Once a room is cleared, the player can go through any of the 3 doors to get to the next room. Each door\u00a0has various modifiers and going through that door\u00a0allows the player to\u00a0 control how the game progresses. This game also relates to the\u00a0tertiary theme, \"the game menu is the first level\".</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What is the goal of the game?</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A: Get as far as you can! Every room will have enemies, which you will need to kill all in order to progress to the next room. You will have multiple choices when going to the next room\u00a0that affects the stats of both you and the enemies. <strong>So be careful about which door you go through!\u00a0</strong>Your highscore is based on the amount of rooms cleared and enemies killed, good luck!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Free Assets Credits (UI, sprites, and music &amp; sounds)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/weapon-pack</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/game-icons</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts</li><li>https://www.zapsplat.com/</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Made by ye boi</strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://jarrett-ang.itch.io/\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/827/827532e9c220db9eca0258c39c961c9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jarrett Ang"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
