Without a ruler,\u00a0 it's citizens turned into dark creatures incapable of making a sound. The long lost princess of the kingdom has come back to reclaim her throne.</p>\n<p>This game was created as a submission for <strong>Ludum Dare 44</strong>, and has two different versions; one that fits in the theme of using Life as a resource (use health to save checkpoints and gain time) , the other version being a fairer and more balanced version.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I suggest the <strong>LD Jam</strong> version if you're judging for <strong>LD44</strong>, but use the <strong>Rebalance</strong> if you get stuck or frustrated. Otherwise, I would suggest the <strong>Rebalance</strong> as a whole.</p>\n<p>All the incredible music and sound effects was done by <strong>A Third Party</strong></p>\n<p>Sprites and Programming done by\u00a0<strong>BumiBomber</strong></p>\n<p>You can find out the game's Ludum Dare page here :\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/the-silent-kingdom-1</p>\n<p>Additionally, I've provided a tutorial for those having difficulties with certain parts :\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fb/6fbc926c3b905a1a6eaeea378e9a2bf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BumiBomber"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
