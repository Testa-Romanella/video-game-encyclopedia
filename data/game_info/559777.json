I've been working on it for some time, using it to learn how to make video games.<br/><br/>It is a local-multiplayer game where two players shoot hearts at eachother, the concept was inspired by games like Stick Fight and Nidhogg, where the premise is simple: two friends duking it out to beat the other one in single combat!<br/><br/>The game features original music for 5 different stages, all filled to the brim with powerups and obstacles in the way as you fight eachother.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:25:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd9/dd9e5b10e74245f17ece8466c50eb632.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OrbitalTenor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
