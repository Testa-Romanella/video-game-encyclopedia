Re-imagined for the sixth generation home consoles, Space Raiders takes the surface-to-air shooting action of the original title and puts it into a third-person urban street setting on the GameCube and PlayStation 2 (the latter only in Japan and Europe). This update features detailed opening cinematics of the alien invasion, story and survival modes, boss battles and three playable characters, each with their own backstory.<br />\nThe game was not well received by fans or newcomers to the series, and received heavy criticism for its bizarre update to the original.</p>", "metacritic": 40, "released": "2002-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-24T21:53:19", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["GameCube", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Taito", "Mastiff", "Sammy"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
