You noticed that you aren't alone there, there seems to be a man in a black suit carrying an AK-47 in his hands. He doesn't seem to behaving normally, so you try to throw AK magazines that was lying on the ground and he seems to be following it, which gives you the chance to investigate the houses. The story isn't really complete yet, and it doesn't really make sense from this point.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE DESCRIPTION :</strong></p>\n<p>Find out what secrets lies in the houses in the middle of a forest, collect items scattered around the environment and use them to unlock certain passages such as locked doors, barricaded doors, put out a flame, and more. Sneak trough the wild Russian to investigate, hide under tables, inside closets, and throw magazines to distract him. The environment isn't the prettiest to look at, i know. But at least i get to play around with AI for this game, and like, LOTS of AI coding...</p>\n<p>Agh! Finally done with this game. Now i can go back to work on <strong>KARLHOT</strong> which is going to be a crossover fan game about the games <strong>KARLSON </strong>and <strong>SUPERHOT</strong>.</p>\n<p>MY OTHER GAMES</p>\n<p>MY COMPLETED GAME<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/256/256fcc469fdb452a74897f4814ffe3ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GREYSETH"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
