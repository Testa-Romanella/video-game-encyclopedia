In Crab Life, you play as a lone bandit crab who has been rejected by society. Instead of being a decent crab, you take revenge on society by stealing algae from others. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Playing as a crab can be weird if it's your first time! As a crab, you move faster sideways rather than moving forward. We made the crab face 90 degrees so that you could use W to move sideways while using A and D to turn. Be careful on how you position yourself, your back is exposed to attack. Be aware of the green bar since that is your block stamina. In order to win, you must collect all the algae in the level. The counter on the top right will tell you how much you have left. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>arrow keys</strong> to move.Press <strong>J </strong>or <strong>K</strong> to punch<br/>Hold <strong>J</strong> and <strong>K</strong> to block.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/><br/>Cole Pergerson: Producer and Sound Designer<br/>Anthony Sokry: Programmer<br/>Thomas Zakh: Programmer<br/>Jessica Thang: Visual Development and Animation<br/>Alec Chou: Menu Design<br/></p>\n<p>Music recorded, mixed, and mastered by Mushman Music and Yes.Yes</p>\n<p>This game was part of a summer game development workshop hosted by the Game Dev Club at San Jose State University.
