I hope you enjoy it!!\r\n<p>(IA is Disabled because is still boring)</p>\n<p>The requirements were:</p>\r\nMovement\r\n<ol><li>The plane moves forward by itself, the user can control turning left and right.\r\n</li><li>When turning, the plane must reduce its speed, and once it finishes turning, it must recover it gradually.\r\n</li><li>If the plane goes off-screen, it must come back from the opposite side, giving the illusion of looping.\r\n</li></ol>\r\nBoost\r\n<ol><li>There must be a button/key for boost that will cause the plane to have a one-time push forward and after that, it recovers its speed.\r\n</li><li>In order to use the boost, a bar must be full, that bar fills with time.\r\n</li><li>Each time the boost is used, the bar empties and restarts to fill.\r\n</li></ol>\r\nAttack\r\n<ol><li>The plane shoots bullets towards its forward vector.\r\n</li><li>If the bullet collides with the opposite player\u2019s plane, it deals damage to that plane.\r\n</li><li>Bullets must travel a limited distance.\r\n</li><li>Just like planes, bullets must have that loop illusion when going off-screen.\r\n</li></ol>\r\nHealth\r\n<ol><li>Each player\u2019s health is represented by a bar.\r\n</li><li>Players lose health each time a bullet impacts their plane.\r\n</li><li>When a player loses all their health, their plane gets \u201cremoved\u201d from the map and the match ends.\r\n</li></ol>\r\nScore and rematch\r\n<ol><li>The winner scores one point.\r\n</li><li>It should be possible to play again as many times as players want. The score is preserved until the game is closed.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>I\u00a0also added 2D lighting, object pools, 2 power ups and health increments, music and some sound FX (created by me),\u00a0\u00a0missiles that chase, particles, and animations, multiple scenarios, animated backgrounds, and some more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T13:35:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3b/e3b2d4764fc6c4e0196969779bc1278a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yunu\u00e9n Vladimir"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
