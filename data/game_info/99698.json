Shortly after I abandoned the project due to increasing work commitments and uncertainty about how to move the project forward.\u00a0</p><p>I still think some of these ideas are cool and might return to it someday. Til then, feel free to check out the build I submitted to the IGF. The source code is also available, though I haven't tried to compile it in a long time and the version of ioq3 it used is almost 10 years out of date as of this writing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/034/03438f150b513420969b797909bd115c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JP LeBreton"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
