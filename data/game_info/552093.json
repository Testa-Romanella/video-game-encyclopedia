As the last sentient toybot, you have to reach the magical portal at the end of the bookshelf, activate your army of Noofblaster towers, and defend yourself from the toy tank invansion!</p>\n\n<p>Toybot's Towers is a genre splice between platformer and tower-defense. Any energy spent in the platformer phase is energy lost in the tower-defense. In the tower-defense, energy is both your currency and your health. The less energy you have, the more points you get from killing tanks. Between balancing your health and currency, try to get the highest score possible!</p>\n<p>This is the first game from any of our team members!</p>\n<p>Made by: Benjamin Reedel, Cameron Woolley, Julian Ritter, Colby Musialek</p>\n<p>Lead Programmers: Benjamin Reedel Cameron Woolley</p>\n<p>Art and Sound: Julian Ritter</p>\n<p>Bugfixing and Moral Support: Colby Musialek</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:36:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bce3aa9e9f62e423440b1c6318d67a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RiseGuy", "ColbyM", "RockoBoro", "scriche"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
