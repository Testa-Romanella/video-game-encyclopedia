I know that's a bold claim, but I don't have to back it up and you're just looking at the screenshots right now anyway so it doesn't really matter what I write here.<br/><br/>Drag petals around the board so that all the colors match up. Some petals are pinned down and can't be dragged. Those are pretty much the only rules. Here's the obligatory bullet list of features:<br/><br/>\u2022 Infinite randomly generated boards<br/>\u2022 Multitouch dragging<br/>\u2022 Four difficulty levels<br/>\u2022 iPhone and iPad compatible<br/>\u2022 Fun times<br/>\u2022 Seriously, there aren't a lot of features, just try it out.<br/>\u2022 I mean, it's pretty cheap.<br/>\u2022 You're probably spending more on electricity sitting here thinking about it.<br/>\u2022 What are you going to regret more tomorrow, buying a fun new game or letting your fear of the unknown prevent you from experiencing pure puzzle-based joy?<br/>\u2022 You probably burn, like, one extra calorie per hour while you're playing this game.<br/>\u2022 Do the right thing.
