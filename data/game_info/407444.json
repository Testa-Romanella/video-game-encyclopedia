The town of Seaside is a popular tourist destination, and Jace\u2019s hometown. Damon plans to work part-time and enjoy his first \u201creal\u201d summer, finally free of claustrophobic student-housing.</p>\n\n<p>After Damon\u2019s parents find out that he\u2019s going through with the move, they cut off all financial assistance. His job search suddenly becomes about more than extra cash. Despite their demands to stay on campus and study during the summer, Damon craves freedom. Rent isn\u2019t cheap in a beachfront cottage, and he needs to find a job quickly. With Jace\u2019s help, Damon narrows down his options to three local spots\u2026</p>\n\n<p>In Tidal Blossoms, you take control of Damon\u2019s choices. Spend your summer working at a bookstore, caf\u00e9, or surf shop! Get to know your co-worker, become good friends, and enjoy your summer vacation together as you grow closer.<br/><strong><br/>The Cast<br/></strong><br/><strong>Mia</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mia is a natural athlete. As a passionate surfer, diver, and volleyball player, people find it hard to keep up with her constant energy. Despite her love for sports and bubbly personality, Mia strays away from the crowd. Labeled as stubborn and lacking in teamwork during high school, she dedicated herself to finding balance in life through mediation. She found peace in the solitude of nature and practices yoga daily. Still, she has difficulty containing her inner fire and often lacks a filter. Mia is constantly in motion.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Ivy</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>For three generations, Ivy\u2019s family has run the local bookstore \u201cSeaside Tales\u201d. Charming and sweet at work, Ivy knows retail well. As an avid reader and gardener, she spends her free time nurturing plants and researching their cultivation in her extensive library. Although addiction isn\u2019t her best trait, it\u2019s a noticeable one. If Ivy goes without her three daily coffees, she\u2019s a zombie until she recaffeinates. Ivy is a night owl and often gets bored throughout the evening. She collects puzzles and card games to keep busy. Lately, locals have seen a change in Ivy. Suddenly short-tempered and quiet at work, she has drove away more than one customer.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Alice</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>A newcomer to Seaside, not many people have gotten to know Alice in the year since her arrival. She works as a barista at the local coffee shop and loves chai lattes. Although her warm smile and \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d charms customers and earns her tips, Alice\u2019s eyes seems faraway. Outside of work, locals would describe her as hard to read, quiet, and aloof. However, Alice does not lack confidence. She\u2019s been known to have a strong sense of leadership in the workplace, and earned herself a spot as a manager at Josie\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter<br/>Lemma Soft</p>\n<p>Instagram</p>\n<p>YouTube<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:43:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4ff205e8f99930a4f08d8ef6159916aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TidalBlossoms"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
