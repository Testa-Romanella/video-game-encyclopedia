A submission for Yaoi Jam 2022, the game features full gamepad and keyboard support - the latter using the tab and enter keys.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<ul><li>Pierce Murphy for the opening song Metaverse</li><li>Holizna for the gameplay song Whatever</li><li>@DejiNyucu for the character art</li><li>Cosmo Myzrail Gorynych for the Ct.js game engine</li></ul>\n<p>Additional content by Michael Bell, j4p4n, brgfx / Freepik, Alucard, Singger, Duisterwho,\u00a0@BenChinapen and @goodnightkev. The game mutes its music after roughly\u00a030 seconds of inactivity.</p>\n<p>This version is a prototype. In a final release, I may add a dedicated poker mode, a better poker AI and fix the issue where players are sometimes asked how to proceed in all-in scenarios but other times not given any choice. I'd probably also add executables\u00a0and make the whole thing bundle-worthy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T17:06:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e10da9d33d2824067c1e9d60282218a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["markmehere"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
