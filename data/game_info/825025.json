You aim to complete the water cycle and collect points on your little adventure. During the game, you go through four stages of the cycle - rain, groundwater, river, and water vapor.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>As the prototype was created in a limited time, some parts are unfortunately a little rushed, and the game is missing sounds and music altogether. I hope to revisit this idea in the future and make a small game from it.\r\n</p>\n<p>Also, the game is computation-heavy in some parts. If you are using a laptop, I suggest not using the power-saving mode when playing.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you like the idea, let me know in the comments and share your best scores :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T18:56:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/709/709e74ef236059b65be04cb65dea1d60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Kubak_cz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
