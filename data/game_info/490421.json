Our pets won&#39;t die and don&#39;t need to be fed, we just like collecting pretty pets to display on our websites and signatures :).</p>\n<p>There are several things to do on Chicken Smoothie. There are new free pets to adopt every month, which will grow up over time. Some pets are rarer than others, so you can trade pets with other players to complete your pet collection. The pets can be decorated with clothing and accessories, and can be displayed on a webpage or in a forum signature. Players chat with each other in our forums. We have a special drawing forum where players can create and color in drawings and share them with other people.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-09T02:34:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/babce92851c6a0ba97a964d6c4738dff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
