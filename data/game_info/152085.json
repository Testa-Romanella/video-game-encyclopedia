However, it isn't that easy as the player is not alone but instead the true mission is to help the main character escape too. To do this the player must control the character's emotions to make sure that the main character is ready to escape. Out of empathy for the character the player will be challenged to find the right escape route while trying to maintain the needs of the character. In the use of compassion towards the character a deeper understanding of the characters origins will be revealed.</p><p>This is still a prototype and is in early stages of its development</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a37f59f2efef6c2deb7123b3ea8fa28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joshua Fryer"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
