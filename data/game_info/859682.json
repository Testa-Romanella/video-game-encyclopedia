As an unassuming farmer, you have to head on over and try to rope back as many animals as you can... before they suffer a colourful uncanny Eldritch fate.</p>\n<p>Theme:</p>\n<p>Every 10 seconds, one of your animals (or neighbors) will be converted into a HoRriFyiNG MonStrOCitY. So while you're wandering the woods, that cow that you have been tracking may suddenly burst before your eyes, going \"POOF\" in a puff of smoke, and leaving behind a horrible demon thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Left Click (when close enough to animal) - beckon them.</p>\n<p>Right Click (when close enough to corrupt animal) - burn them!</p>\n<p>Game Premise:</p>\n<p>Approach different animals and BECKON them to follow you. Lead them one at a time back to your TRAILER, where they will find safety. You might be pursued along the way, so be sure to BURN any unwanted visitors who get too close! Kudos if you manage to save 1 of every animal type.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:41:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2da/2da288e19c211d64af77535fbb45eb7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KentonLS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
