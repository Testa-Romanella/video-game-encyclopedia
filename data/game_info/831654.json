In this game you know everything that is going to happen to you. The problem? There are a lot of obstacles to remember. In this game you will be given a brief period of time to see where the next missiles are coming from. Tiles will also wobble when they are about to fall. The game progressively gets harder the longer you are alive. I made the entire game and all the assets by myself in a total of around 8-9 hours\u00a0but got some play testing and great feedback\u00a0from my brother. Hope you enjoy!</p><p><strong>Resources Used:<br/></strong></p><p>Game Engine: Unity</p><p>Art/Animations:</p><p>Piskel - Free online sprite editor (piskelapp.com)</p><p>Music</p><p>https://www.oceanwaves.io/<br/></p><p>Chrome Music Lab - Song Maker (chromeexperiments.com)</p><p>Sound Effects:</p><p>Leshy SFMaker - Online Sound Effect Generator (leshylabs.com)</p>\n<p><strong>Important info:</strong></p>\n<p>- Missiles come around 2 seconds after warning signs are shown.</p>\n<p>- Warning signs are purposefully placed certain sides of the tiles to indicate which side of the tile the missile will be coming from.</p>\n<p>- Don't try to reactively dodge the missiles!
