One thing that i would like to add(since it's unique to this game) is that you can use the gun given to you to shoot down some obstacles.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed making this game and even though it's a bit clunky and not the most aesthetically pleasing or optimized game the core game play loop is very fun, trust me.</p>\n<p>I do plan on updating it as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Some upcoming updates include:</p>\n<p>A texture update,</p>\n<p>Optimization patches,</p>\n<p>And most importantly Custom Key binds!!!</p>\n<p>Oh and eventually a story line.</p>\n<p>Obviously all of this will take a while and till then i hope you enjoy this little clunky sorta ugly looking 99% bug free awesome game.</p>\n<p>ENJOY :)</p>\n<p><em>Meant to run on windows(64bit)</em></p>\n<p><em>It takes quite a bit of GPU usage download wisely.</em></p>\n<p><em>V</em><em>ersion:1.0.0\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:03:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74abd9f47d97b1793ea19543f7a0b312.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Project_Liquid"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
