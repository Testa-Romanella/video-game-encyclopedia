With friends in unexpected places, perhaps his cause is not lost. After all, villain or hero, it\u2019s all a matter of perspective, right?<br/><br/>Return to the magical world of Roterra, where \u201cup\u201d is relative and you may need to walk across the ceiling or down a wall to find your way.

Roterra is inspired by ORLANDO FURIOSO, a 16th Century poem about love, power and perception.<br/><br/>In Roterra, Princess Angelica must turn cubes to transform dead ends into doorways, toggle switches to reveal staircases and bridges, and even flip the world on its head to find the path and overcome the obstacles set in her way. The puzzles tell the story of a young girl, at first tentative with her newfound magic, growing empowered as she escapes from increasingly difficult mazes created by her power-hungry brother, Orlando. <br/><br/>Traversing the cube-shaped puzzle world of Roterra to regain her rightful place as Queen, Angelica discovers that sometimes the journey matters more than the destination, stereotypes are not to be trusted, and often the only way forward is to change your perspective.<br/><br/>Roterra Extreme\u2122 continues the story from Orlando\u2019s perspective as he runs for safety when his plan to get rid of Angelica falls through. This time, the mazes are created by the world of Roterra itself, punishing Orlando for stealing his sister\u2019s magic. Orlando\u2019s journey is hard and frustrating; his \u201chelpers\u201d are often not very helpful and the world\u2019s magic takes every opportunity to turn him around and block his path. He even finds himself hallucinating as he becomes increasingly more panicked and lost. Where Angelica\u2019s story is one of triumph and self-discovery, Orlando\u2019s only concern is escaping pursuit and finding a safe place to regroup.<br/><br/>Learn more about Angelica, Orlando and the 16th Century poem, ORLANDO FURIOSO, that inspired the game at playroterra.com<br/><br/>Need help?
