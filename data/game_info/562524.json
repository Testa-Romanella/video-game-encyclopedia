In the \"How to fish\" menu you can see how many follower-fish\u00a0you need to successfully eat the bigger fish. You also get points for eating other fish and the number of friendly fish following you works as a score multiplier.\u00a0 And finally you can change the difficulty (increase or decrease the friendly fish spawn rate) in the game over menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T11:06:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73d/73d16b10882f8834b18fbf3c3f296916.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["A_Random_Function"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
