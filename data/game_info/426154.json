This was an extra credit assignment, where we had to make a non-violent FPS game. While the protagonist of this game does not \"shoot\", he does throw a projectile. There are no goals/achievements,\u00a0and there\u00a0is no way to \"win\" at <strong>Fetch!\u00a0</strong>When one plays fetch with a dog in real life, is there a way to \"win\"? This game is simply a fun time-waster.\u00a0Thanks for checking my game out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T02:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84a/84af34e934508f4ffd3a1f74838f4390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nickbiglin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
