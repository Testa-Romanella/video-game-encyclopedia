An dead bystander will cause nearby bystanders to panic. Panicking bystanders have a chance to cause other nearby bystanders to panic in a contagion effect. The panic effect also spreads to red targets making them harder to take out.</p>\n<p>Persons hit with poison rounds will start to walk around in a daze.\u00a0They will die faster when they are moving.</p>\n<p>Credit:</p>\n<p>Awesome gun sounds:\u00a0https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/sound-effects-search.php?q=suppressed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:29:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f8acd94aa6de6c3d3e847c5c2d00f9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["martymon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
