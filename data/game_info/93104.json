KEEP YOUR DEFENSE POLISHED!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs one of the legendary Glass Heroes of Ancient Times, you rise to find that a bunch of Jerkwads have started terrorizing the world again. With your trusty shield, you become a GLASS CANNON, with your shield protecting your frail body from danger with its massive power!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe shield will keep you safe, defending you from projectiles and enemies looking to start a fight, but with proper use, it also serves as an extremely important FORCE for good! Time your shield uses against your enemies to smash them across the field-- the more enemies you hit, the better score bonus!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>EXCITING TO MAKE, EXCITING TO PLAY</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn what can only be described as a freestyle session between Jesse Burnett and Greg Goodson, \r\n\t<em>GLASS CANNONS</em> was made playable almost immediately after Greg pitched the idea to Jesse &amp; tj. Utilizing an extremely simple graphic style and remnants of the old Joylancer engine, <em>GLASS CANNONS</em> was given life and very quickly became one of our more exciting smaller projects.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>NOW AVAILBLE ON ITCH.IO!</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>GLASS CANNONS</em> was first officially released with the <em><strong>ACTION SIX! vol.I </strong></em>bundle, and has been released stand-alone on itch.io in order to help support further development of this project, and of the many projects that we have in development at a6. Every purchase helps keep us doing what we do best!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLook forward to the \r\n\t<em>POLISH PLUS</em> version of <em>GLASS CANNONS</em> coming out in 2015! Buy it now while it's cheap to secure your spot among the other glass warriors who will be waking up soon...\r\n<br/><br/><strong>NOTE:\u00a0This game is currently no longer supported.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a55/a55a3fe0669903985c0a7db644696d99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alpha six productions"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
