As the Little Mermaid ascends into the atmosphere, she is greeted by other daughters, who tell her she has become like them because she strove with all her heart to obtain an immortal soul. Because of her selflessness, she is given the chance to earn her own soul by doing good deeds for mankind for 300 years, and will one day rise up into Heaven.\"</p>\n<p>so, I thought that the sea folk bitsy jam would be a good way to explore it and give the little mermaid something like a happy ending, even if it is with the sea witch who originally tricked her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>if you'd like to learn more about the queer allegory of the little mermaid and the reason i'm attracted to this story lately, this lithub article is great\u00a0</p>\n<p>thanks- hope you like it!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T07:31:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/645/6453f003e73dd9a72185668afce9366c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["katykoop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
