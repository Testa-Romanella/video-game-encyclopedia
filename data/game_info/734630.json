{"id": 734630, "slug": "chapter-master", "name": "Chapter Master", "name_original": "Chapter Master", "description": "<p>Chapter Master is a fan-made Warhammer 40,000 game where you take the role of a newly minted Chapter Master of a Space Marine Chapter. The sector to which you are assigned has desperate need of a Space Marine presence, as the sector is overrun with all sorts of evil and foul creatures.</p>\n<p>A Turn-Based Strategy game that is infamous for being as hard as Dwarf Fortress, this game shows just how hard it is to run a chapter properly. From being forced to maintain your own ships, to amassing your own resources, training and other necessities, it often seems as if your chapter lurches from one extreme to the other, and your death is inevitable. Additionally, the game itself is constructed in a very similar way to Masterof Orion, including the fleet space traveling part.</p>\n<p>Just how the universe likes it.</p>\n<p>It had a very troubled development history, but was eventually released online on August 6th, 2014, though as a mod to an ostensibly different game named Interstellar Army Simulator, in order to avoid troubles with Games Workshop lawyers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T02:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/32008ce5af3becafeb80b293aff52587.jpg", "website": "https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Chapter_Master_(game)", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
