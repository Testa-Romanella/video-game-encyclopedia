In the spirit of games such as Diablo and Nethack, you explore a randomly generated dungeon that is filled with loot, upgrades, sacred shrines, traps and monsters. Death is permanent, and the only real objective is to reach as far into the depths as possible. Or is it? yes, it really is. I haven't really thought of anything else yet.  <br/></p>\n<p> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T07:06:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/673/67334a671a4f365cfff5a78cd9b12051.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["leuat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
