You would literally draw 8x10 pitch on a piece of paper and play it at school with friends. It was great fun!</p>\n<p>In this case, I've decided to build a MVP of a Paper Soccer project.<br/>The AI for the opponent is not the best out there, but it will definitely punish you for stupid mistakes. There is also element of randomness involved so that not a single game will be the same.</p>\n<p>I would really appreciate all the feedback.</p><p>I have some ideas for additional modes for the game, as well as online multiplayer, so if you're interested in playing this game in the future (either on mobile or desktop) make sure to follow my page so that you won't miss it out once it's released!<br/><br/>Also, if you've played the game, let me know in the comments down below what was:<br/></p><ul><li>the biggest combo you've scored</li><li>the fastest win you've had</li><li>the longest game when it comes to number of moves you've had</li><li>the shortest game (number of moves wise) you've had</li></ul><p>Enjoy!<br/><br/>#\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_soccer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T05:50:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/224c2e26884a53c96703cf5f4eb4d578.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jsokol"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
