You must find batteries to keep your suit powered to stay alive. On your way you discover that you have mutated and\u00a0are able duplicate yourself! Use this new ability to transverse your broken ship in order to survive.</p>\n<p>The game is structured as a maze game that players have to navigate through as the puzzles challenge the expectations the player has of the puzzle. The puzzles get larger and more complex as the levels continue. The user will also have to duplicate their character to continue in paths allowing for more complex game play. The theme adds to the atmosphere as the character is isolated from its other selves to solve the puzzles. </p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>All creators can be found on the Unity asset store</p>\n<p>Metal textures-NOBIAX / YUGHUES</p>\n<p>Spaceman asset-HONETi</p>\n<p>Toxic waste and barrels assets-MYXERMAN</p>\n<p>Battery asset-256PX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T05:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3c/b3c725f7837bcfc61816d1054de95307.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["kaedenharrell"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
