The goal of each level is to conduct the gnome Borra on the level map to the potion flask. The player uses special action cards with the help of which he can create objects or somehow influence these objects. From level to level, tasks become more complicated, new objects and opportunities for interaction are added. The basis of the game is changing the direction of the laser beam using mirrors, but this is not the only mechanics. There are also hammers, bombs, enemies, ponds, and all this perfectly brings diversity at every level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-25T20:32:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf7eeaca60fc6bba7be6a59a7ee81200.jpg", "website": "https://vk.com/robots_will_take_over_the_world", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
