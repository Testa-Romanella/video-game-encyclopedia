The action game, which has been rumoured to have been in development since 2013 and is due to hit shelves in November 2017, features an all-black cast of characters.<br/>\nThe game, which is set in 2025, is set in an alternate reality where the player has mastered the language of computer games at the age of 12 years old. In this era, players are competing to be the top 100,000 computer gamers for a chance to stay alive and progress in their careers by gaining new clients.\n\nIt's truly gripping, if that is the word we're used to hearing from a game this enthusiastic.

So, it's a very good thing for Naughty Dog too, because seriously though\u2026\n\nThe game is inspired by the hit game Uncharted.\n\nThis game is very much on the level of the Uncharted games, but with a twist.\n\nGrand Theft Auto V features an abundance of stuff \u2013 vehicles</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T07:55:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f86b4c129b04f16f0d5944567c5b112.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
