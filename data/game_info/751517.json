The game features cubes which produce different physical units in the 0D to 3D factory. You probably have something better to do with your time than playing this, but if you wish, you can play it until it crashes. Note that it does not save, so if it crashes you will have to restart, which you probably don't want to do.</p>\n<p>Avoid the bugs and survive until the end of the game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>/!\\ Game breaking bug: leaving cells in the structure when upgrading its dimension makes them unavailable in the upcoming ones.
