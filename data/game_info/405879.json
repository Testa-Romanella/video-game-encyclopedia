You can also show which cards you have in the collection (not many at the moment). The deckbuilder and the possibility to win cards will be added in the next update.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to conquer your opponents cards. Every card has 4 strengths, one for every direction. If you place a card next to an opponents card and the strength of your card is greater than the opponents, you conquer this card.</p>\n<p>The winner is the one with the most cards at the end.</p>\n<p>If you win, you can choose a card from the opponent that you conquered. Then the game ends.</p>\n<p>There are currently no sounds or pleasing visual effects, the goal was to make a prototype and focus on the coding part. But I will make a full game out of it with a purpose.</p>\n<p>Thank you for testing this little demo\u00a0;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T04:35:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/baf/bafc2a40a042605bb3c0c8611c393632.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TrobbizSH"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
