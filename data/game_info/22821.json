Your name is Jack Mower, a 20th century dude who just happened to be sucked into the world of Nox via his TV set. The world is in danger and you have to save it! But before you embark on your epic journey you must choose your path: warrior, wizard, or conjurer.<br/><br/>\nChoose the path of a warrior, and you will be able to equip and use all manner of swords, battle-axes, war hammers, and chakrams - though you\u2019ll leave the magical mumbo-jumbo up to the Conjurer and Wizard classes. An enchanted weapon is the closest a Warrior gets to magic but that\u2019s OK, because magic is for sissies.<br/><br/>\nAs a Wizard you will explore the mystical art of spell casting, ranging from enemy-confounding illusions to devastating displays of metaphysical force. You\u2019ll also learn to set magical traps containing deadly spell combinations to thwart the unsuspecting foe. Although you\u2019ll have to renounce the use of ungainly swords and armor in the name of your art, you will still be able to wield a staff as a last-ditch physical defense.<br/><br/>\nIf you choose a Conjurer you will be able to magically charm and summon creatures to do your bidding. You can even create a magical creature called a bomber which can wreak sorcerous havoc on your enemies. You\u2019ll also get plenty of experience wielding staves and bows to fend off the few enemies who manage to slip past your minions.<br/>Three separate storylines - one for each class - ensure many hours of memorable, addictive and FUN gaming\nMany unique gameplay features like true line of sight, and a physics engine\nMasterful blend of RPG and action elements, accompanied by beautiful music, great humor, and an impressive variety of weapons", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-30T09:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/580/580555d3bc39d221015cfd5527068383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.26, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 76, "owned": 266, "beaten": 101, "toplay": 40, "dropped": 31, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 135, "suggestions_count": 521, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 137, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Westwood Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
