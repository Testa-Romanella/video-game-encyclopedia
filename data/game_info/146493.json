Make your way from one shore, to the other!</p>Gameplay<p>Right-click (or any key) to throw seeds, which grow trees and rarely bushes.</p><p>Left-click to swing on trees. Note: click just <em>past</em> the target.</p><p>The distance you throw seeds depends on whether you're swinging, stationary, or moving through the air.</p><p>Only two seeds can be thrown at a time - time your tosses strategically!</p><p>When you reach the far end of the island, a few stats will be shown. Have fun swinging around and planting seeds until then!</p>Stats<p>NUMBER OF TREES: How many trees you've planted</p><p>MAX SPEED: Maximum player velocity, in pixels per second (lag-adjusted)</p><p>MAX HEIGHT: How high you've reached relative to the bottom of the ocean, in pixels</p><p>FURTHEST FLIGHT: The maximum distance you've traveled without colliding with the ground, in pixels</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Soron"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
