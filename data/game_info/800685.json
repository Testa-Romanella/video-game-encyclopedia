(I was also making it on a laptop so testing the controls was pretty hard - but each level is possible)</p>\n<p>This is a simple yet infuriating first person platform game, there are 3 levels that you can try and get to the end of each level with there own global leaderboard to show of the top times of all players. The levels get harder each time, so try not to break anything when you can't pass level 3 ;)</p>\n<p>Have fun playing !</p>\n\n<p>I would like to update the game a bit after the game jam has finished, I had an idea of adding a multiplayer game mode where 4 players can race to the end but you'd be able to push each other of the platforms and get in each others way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits Due:</strong></p>\n<p>Here We Go by Imperss | https://soundcloud.com/imperss</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p>Creative Commons CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n\n<p>We've Got Time by LiQWYD | https://soundcloud.com/liqwyd/</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p>Creative Commons CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n\n<p>Character Controller from\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/PlaiDev\u00a0FPS tutorials</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T15:35:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/003/003ae3b6c323e612423373108b992ae7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Nutty Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
