Whereas the original 140 years old game has its 15 pieces numbered from 1 to 15 (hence its name), this one has no numbers, all pieces are the same. At first I wondered what kind of joke this was, with its boasting \"World's Hardest 15-puzzle\"? All pieces are identical, game's resolved! That is, until I began fiddling with it and saw some pieces lighting on! Then I figured each piece has its intended place where it lights up, and the game's done once all pieces shine.</p>\n<p>I also found a vintage printed ad about this game which confirms this. It looks like the game was a novelty trinket from the Wild West era, and from what I've been told about my ancestor that would quite fit his adventurous personnality. But, this is still bewildering. I never heard of this, had it any success? Is there any other copy of this? How does it work? How come it still works after more than a century? It seems this was manufactured in France, I wonder whether I can find any more information here.\r\n </p>\n<p>Anyway, here's a rough copy of that ad, I hope I'll find some time to scan it:\r\n </p>\r\nYou already know the 15 puzzle which recently became a widespread phenomon. A mere toy for children, may you think? Yet let us show you how demanding that game can be with this amazing brain twister coming straight from France! Imagine:<br/>- All pieces are strictly identical, with no distinguishable detail.<br/>- Where the hole should be changes with every game.<br/>- Each block lights on only once in place, thanks to the magic of electricity!<br/>\r\n \r\n\r\nOnly possible thanks to modern science!\r\n<br/>\r\nTrain your brain, improve your hand &amp; eye coordination!\r\n <br/>\r\nEach play is a new game!\r\n <br/>\r\nTotally safe!\r\n <br/>\r\nHigh durability!\r\n <br/>\r\nPlay it everywhere!\r\n <br/>\r\nMade with the most delicate materials from France!\r\n <br/>\r\nIt'll cost you only what you want!\r\n\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Arrow keys or gamepad to switch hole with a piece next to it.</li><li>To start another game press Enter and select \"Reset cart\".</li></ul>\n\n<p>The game was made for the\u00a0Thinky Puzzle Game Jam and in 560 chars or less for the\u00a0Tweet Tweet Jam 6.
