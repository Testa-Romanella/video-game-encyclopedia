Draw on the table while waiting for your opponent to make a move in chess, or flip the table into deep space after losing an all-in bet? The table is your oyster!<br/></p>\r\nOnline multiplayer\r\n<p>You can play online with friends in the click of a button, no login or sign-up required! Simply host a game, and share the room code with your friends.
