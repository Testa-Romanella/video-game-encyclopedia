You can play the game that inspired the creation of this game, and even look at the source code to see how the jam/prototype works!</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Using the jam version as a base, RandomMomentania remade and reworked the idea into a full game that expands and refines the concepts expressed in the jam game. Everything was written from the ground up to provide challenging puzzles that are fun to solve.\r\n    <br/>\n</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Dreams of Fire has<strong> 20 carefully crafted levels</strong>. These levels can be played in any order and are <strong>designed to be challenging and fun</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>A fully featured, powerful level editor is included with Dreams of Fire</strong>, allowing you to make levels just like those in the game. <strong>Our tools are your tools</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>The controls are fully customizable</strong>, with every key in the game configurable so you can play using whatever layout is ideal for you. The <strong>graphic settings are customizable</strong> too, allowing you to tweak the game so it looks great and runs fast.\r\n        <ul>\n<li><strong>Xbox 360 and Xbox One </strong>controllers are supported when playing levels. A mouse is still needed for navigating the UI however.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Share levels with others across different devices easily.</strong> Levels in Dreams of Fire are stored within a single file, so sharing levels with friends is as simple as attaching it in an email. Create your puzzles and share them with the world!</li>\n<li><strong>Runs on all major desktop platforms</strong>: Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</li>\n<li>(<em>COMING SOON!</em>) You can also find <strong>Dreams of Fire on iOS</strong>. <strong>Nothing is removed from the iOS version</strong>.
