They have to collect all crystals around the map, and they have to do so before time runs out. However, they also have to dodge projectiles from enemies while doing these two things.\u00a0This game encapsulates the saying, \"If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Instructions: </strong>use WASD to move, space to jump/double jump, mouse to angle camera view, and tab to pause.
