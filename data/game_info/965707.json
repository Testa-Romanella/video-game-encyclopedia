Instead of clicking your mouse, you have to be a wanderer to collect and raise TAIYAKI on the field.<br/>\r\nThe background and basic environment are like the following.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe feline protagonist discovers that upon awakening, his primary objective is to gather \"TAIYAKI,\" a commodity that he has deemed essential to his existence. He understands that collecting and accumulating TAIYAKI is his purpose and goal, with the ultimate aim of welcoming the deity who created him to the earth. Since birth, the cat has been plagued with existential questions but has yet to find a satisfactory answer. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo resolve these issues, the cat collects TAIYAKI found in the world and acquires various \"amplifiers\" and upgrades to accelerate the process of gathering TAIYAKI, and by saturating the world with his creed, he hopes to resolve his personal and global issues. The cat believes that by fulfilling this purpose, he will be able to welcome the deity who brought him into existence.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe cat must also attend to the basic necessities of survival in the world, such as satisfying hunger and quenching thirst. These basic needs are met by procuring food and water from the world, however, resources may be limited. The cat's lifespan is also consumed by the depletion of resources in the world. The fact that survival is a prerequisite to collecting TAIYAKI, means that the cat's purpose is doubled, creating a dichotomy between simply living and living with purpose. Navigating this duality is a skill that must be practiced in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEating more TAIYAKI is said to bring happiness, but the task of collecting TAIYAKI is arduous. The cat must explore and traverse a world filled with obstacles to find every TAIYAKI. This process can be seen as a form of training. Additionally, there are special items that can be acquired by utilizing materials found in the world. For example, \"MANEKINEKO\" can propagate TAIYAKI, and there are other items that serve the same purpose. The world is abundant with various materials and items.<br/>\r\nThe cat progresses to the next world by using portals that appear upon praying at shrines. Temples are scattered throughout the world, and by praying at these temples, portals will appear. These portals transport the cat to new worlds.<br/>\r\nCollecting TAIYAKI and gathering the power of creeds can increase the number of allies. This is an effective way to counteract enemies, as increasing the number of allies increases power and improves the chances of defeating enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMay the \"TAIYAKI\" be with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOverview<br/>\r\nThe cat should survive in the field and collect TAIYAKIs.<br/>\r\nAnd increase the number of TAIYAKIs by devices and upgrades.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTAIYAKIs<br/>\r\nTAIYAKI is the currency of this game. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDevices<br/>\r\nTAIYAKIs can be increased by devices.<br/>\r\nDevices are built from materials in the field.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUpgrades<br/>\r\nTAIYAKIs can be increased by upgrades.<br/>\r\nUpgrades are built from materials in the field.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFood and Drinks<br/>\r\nThe cat should keep his attributes by eating food and drinking.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-01T04:57:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99a/99a955e019dea69082350b7918d7a1ab.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/2nekcom", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2nek"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["2nek"], "esrb_rating": null}
