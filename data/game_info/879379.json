The users helped it to devolve into creepy misery. It was playable only because it went wrong all the time. Now it works better, and as a result is of no interest. It's all pulleys and levers, men behind curtains.</p>\n<p><em>ELIZA's creator, Weizenbaum, regarded the program as a method to show the superficiality of communication between man and machine, but was surprised by the number of individuals who attributed human-like feelings to the computer program, including Weizenbaum's secretary.</em> Did I spell \"Dungeon\" correctly in this game? Probably not.<br/></p>\n<p>A game made in Python 3, using the adventurelib library, with source code included. Requires a modern version of Windows (10+) and knowledge of how to use a terminal / DOS window on that OS. Source code can be compiled on other platforms if you know how to use pyinstaller. There are most likely bugs.</p>\n<p>Amusingly / unsettlingly, while the source code has basic coverage for typed obscenities, compiling it has removed that part of the code. Good to see that the bizarre puritanical attitude of 80s text adventures to swearing remains to the present day.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T14:53:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d24/d24577b931e10583916644cca139b0cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michelle Lyons"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
