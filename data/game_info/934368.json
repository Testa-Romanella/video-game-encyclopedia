With a GUN!</p>\n<p>Upgrade your gun, upgrade your sparse healing items, and try not to run out of bullets, as the only thing worse than having 1 bullet is having none.</p>\n<p>Features randomly generated adventures and varied music!</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The LITE version allows upgrades to be persistent across runs. This allows for easy cheesing and under 3-minute runs, and 10 minute adventures.\u00a0Consider this the \"easy\" version of the game.</p>\n<p>The LIKE version resets ALL progress upon death, including upgrades and purchases. This forces you to learn from your mistakes, and allows for 4 minute runs and 30 minute adventures.
