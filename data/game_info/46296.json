After decades/centuries imprisoned in cryopreservation, Adam finally awakes. No notion of where or when he is. With oxygen levels running desperately low, he uses the nearly depleted energy source to escape. <br/>But not to freedom. The city is unfamiliar, dangerous. The world Adam knew is gone. <br/>After a while, the first memories come back to him about the person closest to him - his daughter. Like links of chain - before prison - the last moments of his life start to come out.<br/>He remembers the year 5000.<br/>How the sunrays stream shifted. How it wasn\u2019t enough to synthesize the plants and how fast they died because of it. How soon after all life followed.  <br/>Memories of time when comfort and money lost its value. When survival became routine and life - cheaper than food. <br/>He remembers his police work against the raging cannibalism.<br/> He remembers how hard it was to kill a starving unarmed man who was engaged in cannibalism. This caused riots of citizens. Anarchy from people he defended by killing.  Adams employers used this situation to make him a scapegoat to hide their own sins. The governors of the government warehouse were stealing food for themselves. Adam took a difficult decision, because he had only two options: to condemn his daughter to starve or become a robber himself.<br/>In this new world of bone and ash Adam finally finds other life.
