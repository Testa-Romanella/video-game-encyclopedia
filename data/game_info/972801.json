{"id": 972801, "slug": "alternate-existence", "name": "Alternate Existence", "name_original": "Alternate Existence", "description": "Howdy...<br/>I am <strong>MrKnobb</strong>, currently creating a Visual Novel called <strong>Alternate Existence</strong> &amp; my previous completed game <strong>Retrieving the Past</strong> is already available on Steam. <br/><br/><strong>Please note this is <strong>Season 1</strong> of Alternate Existence. <strong>Season 2 </strong>is currently in production and will be available on Steam much later as a DLC. </strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Alternative Existence Synopsis</strong>:<br/>I am 22 years old. I have no memory of my parents as a child and no idea who or where they might be. I lived with an older woman when I was younger but even that didn\u2019t last. She passed me on to foster care and I bounced from one family to another like a pinball until an incident caused that dismal little game to crash, to an end. The day of the incident I left and never turned back.<br/><br/>I work a minimum wage grind at a grubby diner and when I manage to find the time, I study astronomy after hours. All this could quite possibly change with a snap of the fingers \u2013 the fingers belonging to this guy who walked in for a weak coffee and greasy fries. He came over and made an offer. He spoke and I listened. His speech wove one helluva tale. It presented a way out. A way that comes with a price.<br/><br/>So here I am, gnawing on his words in my head. Going over everything, he said, replaying it and hitting rewind, again and again. And I just can\u2019t shake it. This deal of his. The idea that there is something just around the corner, something more to these nine to five drudges. His planted seed and the twisting words. The door cracking open to something else. Something more than just being, \u2018me\u2019. Still even with this 'deal' of his I can\u2019t help but feel my life is not aligned. I can sense it, this alternative to my existence. <br/><br/><strong>NOTICE</strong>:<br/>Take note ALL characters displayed in a sexual nature in the game are over 18 and the game is <strong>intended for 18 and older</strong>.<br/><br/>Alternate Existence is a harem game but will also have a girlfriend option. There are story driven women in game that you cannot choose to date or not. Then there are plenty of women that you can choose to start something with or not.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing to take note of is that some of the characters that appeared in Retrieving the Past will make an appearance in Alternate Existence as both games share the same universe.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>ALTERNATE EXISTENCE'S STORY</strong>:<br/>Life is not fair, this we all know too well. Such is true for our protagonist which is YOU the player. You have no memories of your family, just that you had to make it so far in your life without much help from anyone. Foster homes came and went, and you always felt unwelcome, except for this one household but that didn't last long enough to enjoy. <br/><br/>Now you are a young man and have to find your way to love, sex and oh yes, a better existence. So, let's take this journey together shall we!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>CHOICE BASED &amp; STORY DRIVEN</strong>:<br/>Alternate Existence will be more of a game than my previous Kinetic Novel, Retrieving the Past. In Alternate Existence you will have to make a choice to date, have fun with or just have sex with some of the women or, don't choose any of the women when given a choice.<br/><br/>Its heavily story driven with characters that will make you feel emotionally invested in them and letting them go may be something you may regret later on. If you choose not to hang out with a girl at all, there will still be plenty sexy time with the dedicated story driven girls in the game. You also get the chance at the start of the game to choose a \"girlfriend\" from two choices. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>WHAT IT TAKES TO CREATE A VISUAL NOVEL</strong>:<br/>Lots and lots of hours of work. Buying assets to use in the program that I use to create the images and animations. Coding, lots of coding for each episode and with that I have to have a lead coder and proofreader that makes up a small part of my team. I also have beta testers that assist in making sure each update has the quality needed to make it to final production. All music written and recorded by me, MrKnobb!<br/><br/><br/><br/>So what do you as the player get for <strong>Season 1</strong> of Alternate Existence?<br/><br/>1. Total of 6597 images<br/>2. Total of 339 animations<br/>3. Total of 28256 lines dialogue and code<br/>4. Audio - 90 sound files<br/><br/>Meaning hours and hours of story, game play and some sexy time with hot, beautiful women already for you to enjoy! <br/><br/>.: LATAZ, MrKnobb :.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T05:57:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/796/796302032ed645b724c858877143f83c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 410, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["MisterKnobb"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MisterKnobb", "Misterknobbinc"], "esrb_rating": null}
