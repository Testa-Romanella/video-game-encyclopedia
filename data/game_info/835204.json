Growing up Native Hawaiian in Honolulu, Hawaii, he experienced a somewhat 'postmodern' and dissonant existence of clashing cultures, peoples, and extreme inequality. Inspired by games like Fallout, System Shock, Deus Ex and films like Aliens, The Matrix, Bladerunner, District 9, and Elysium, he has gone on to write stories and create games in the tradition of dark, cautionary, and (hopefully) groundbreaking science fiction. Neofeud is an adventure-puzzle game that aspires to be complex, compelling, and challenging. Christian now lives on the Big Island of Hawaii with his loving, geeky, cosplaying Canadian wife, and two kids.\r\n</p>\n<p>We're a little volunteer army working out of Section 8 and plumbing-free microhomes, so please consider donating through\u00a0Patreon!
