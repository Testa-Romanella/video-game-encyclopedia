You hear noises in the distance and hope it is somebody that can help. You find that those noises are zombies hungry for human flesh. Kill all of the zombies to survive!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Gameplay Goal: immersion/thrill of danger/completion. Our map, menu, and sound design create an immersive zombie experience. The thrill of danger is present via the in-game music, sound effects, and the zombies running up to you and screaming at you trying to kill you. The end goal of our game is to kill all the zombies and survive, thus completing the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Workload: Our game STRANDED draws inspiration from the 3DFPS project we worked on in class. We were unable to create a gun that worked effectively so we were forced to reuse the one from the project. Kyle worked on the menu system, programming logic, and enemy animations. Joey designed the map, balanced the zombies, and programmed as well. Assets were imported for the map, menu, and enemy design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T16:35:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cc/2ccce4578daf7d1021811fac95db7305.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["JP207746"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
