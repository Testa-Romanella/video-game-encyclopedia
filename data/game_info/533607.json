Just as civilization had started to recover, however, another crisis fell upon it - an extra-terrestrial armada pillaged the earth, taking with them virtually all of the known supplies of gold. Society was plunged into chaos - financial markets experienced a recession of unparalleled proportions, electronics production ceased altogether, and people with dental fillings dared not wander out in public.</p>\n<p>An international task force was created with the aim of recovering the gold. Scraping together what they could with the miniscule amount that had not been plundered, a shuttle was constructed that would serve justice upon the invaders. It contained a few spherical exploration pods, which would navigate the planetary surface by means of bouncing upon it.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for piloting the pods and returning all of the gold to Earth. If this mission fails, humanity will be doomed to return to the Stone Age.</p>\n<p>You are our only hope!</p>\n<p><strong>Bounce\u00a0your\u00a0way\u00a0through\u00a0fifteen\u00a0levels\u00a0of\u00a0challenging\u00a0gameplay\u00a0and fast\u00a03-D\u00a0action\u00a0with\u00a0<em>Cosmic\u00a0Payback</em>,\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a048K/128K\u00a0ZX\u00a0Spectrum.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>This game won 3rd place in the 2020 Yandex Retro Games Battle.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T08:22:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a0472c1393e16e0c0cc7a4327a0ea97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PROSM Software"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
