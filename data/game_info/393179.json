It consists in aligning and placing the red blocks over previously placed ones (by pressing the ENTER key). The unaligned blocks will fall down and will be destroyed, reducing the possibility to gain the prize. The two yellow bars correspond to the minor and major prizes. Once arrived to the first bar, the player can choose to take the minor prize and conclude the game, or risk for the greater prize. When all the blocks are destroyed, the player loses.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T07:55:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83b/83b647a6587b8aa5d69372ab8b11fc77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alv90"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
