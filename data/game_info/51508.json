Exchange currency from ALC to USD and use it for later upgrades or bill pay? It is now possible with <strong>AltCoin</strong> simulation game. As of right now, there are two ways to mine virtual crypto-currency:Manual Mining:<br/><ul><li>Press \"X\" as many times as you want to manually mine currency<br/></li><li>Convert ALC to USD and buy Energy Drinks to increase your manual mining speed</li></ul>Cloud Mining via Automated Mining Machine (AMM):<br/><ul><li>Turn your AMM and mine without any extra work<br/></li><li>Upgrade GPU, RAM and CPU to increase hashrate speed<br/></li><li>Keep up with electrical bill and make sure to not have your power shut down</li></ul>Our Roadmap:<br/>Our ideal goal is to create a virtual network where Steam users will be able to not only mine and upgrade their equipment, but also interact with each other. As of right now, our little team is looking for the best solution on how to handle server's side connection, which will make players able to transfer our virtual currency to each other. In other words, exchange with other players and simulate actual crypto-currency market. We estimate that our ideas will be finalized and fully implemented by the end of February, if not sooner.<br/><br/>MacOS &amp; Linux support shall be available within a week of initial AltCoin release.Please note:<br/>Please note that \"AltCoin\" is not an actual crypto-currency, but rather a fun way to spend your time and simulate it's market. Enjoy and please leave any feedback in steam sub-forums.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab8/ab8ede37bc7f56196f147fd36e31cbe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revived Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["ACID"], "esrb_rating": null}
