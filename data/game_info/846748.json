He saw with his own eyes how his parents were executed and his village looted and destroyed. He survives the attack because it was hidden in a trunk where he liked to get into as a child, and from there he could see what was going on. There he waited until the bandits left. The young man realized that the looters had taken an object of great power that his father possessed.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>He was left alone and had to live on his own as he could, some time later an old man took him in and began to train him as his disciple, thus developing his skills and combat technique. This old man told him the origin and history of that group of bandits who murdered his family, it was a clan of monks who yearned for power and the conquest of new territories. He also told her about the object that had been stolen from his family, it was an ancestral amulet with supernatural powers, which had the ability to become a demi-god if the individual who carried it was strong enough.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The old man transmitted to him the values of discipline, honor, service, respect and the arts of war. In the meantime, the monk clan grew stronger and dominated more territories. It is then that the young man, who is 20 years old, discovers that his teacher is killed by the monks when he was training in the forest. Thusmus realizes that he has once again lost what he loved the most and decides to take revenge, finish them off and retrieve the amulet without further delay, putting his life on the line and searching for the legendary katana.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Will Thusmus be able to defeat Kuro and his entire clan of monks?</strong></p>\n<p><em>You will find all the controls you need to play this game in a screenshot in this next section.</em><br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>The game is made by Barreira A+D students: Marc De Val, Jhon Nieto, Marcos Aznar and Joan Mel\u00f3.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The following students have also participated in the project: Pablo L\u00f3pez and Pablo Herrero.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The music of the entire video game has been composed by Luis Bosch.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Supervised by the team of teachers of the Barreira A+D higher education center.</strong></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>You can download the game in the section below totally free!</p>\n<p>From the team of this project we hope you like it!</p>\n<p>Follow us on instagram and see everything we have published during the project:\u00a0<strong>the_fate_of_thusmus</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T10:03:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b370917edd4b08af8a89da8fb3b4772.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Fate Of Thusmus"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
