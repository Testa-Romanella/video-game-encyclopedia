DVD (Digital Versatile Dave) has created a hit single (which is arguably the best song ever made) and stored it on a golden CD, but his musical rival Turntable came along and broke the CD into 20 different pieces!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now it's your job (as Dave) to traverse 20 unique levels, making use of rather\u00a0<em>eccentric</em> controls to pick up the 20 different fragments of the golden CD, piece them all together, and finally listen to the best song ever!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p><em>Play Button\u00a0</em>: Hold the play button down with your mouse to make Dave move horizontally at a regular speed. Running into brick walls at this speed will have no consequences, but attempting to travel over water at this speed will result in Dave experiencing... what robots experience when submerged in water.</p>\n<p><em>Pause Button\u00a0</em>: Click this button with your mouse to teleport Dave a short distance forward. Doing so is helpful for dodging enemies and getting past brick walls, but be mindful of where you're teleporting! This button will have a short cooldown before it can be used again.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Stop Button\u00a0</em>: Click this button with your mouse to provide Dave with a temporary shield/force field to protect him from enemies. It won't last forever though, so be mindful of when you activate this shield! This button will have a short cooldown before it can be used again.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Fast-Forward Button\u00a0</em>: Hold the play button down with your mouse to make Dave\u00a0move\u00a0horizontally at a rapid speed. Attempting to travel over water at this speed will allow Dave to move swiftly over the surface without consequence, but running into brick walls at this speed will result in Dave experiencing... the side-effects of Newton's third law of motion.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:31:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cab/cabbfed63a9d1577314cdc83a629de1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Borken Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
