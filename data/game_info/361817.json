I had 48 hours to make the game (for the theme \"only one\")\u00a0so some parts weren't finished in time. I know there's a lot of space to improve, in sound quality, visual effects, enemy balancing, additional features and so on. But please bear in mind that this was made under a certain time limit. I had some features in mind that due to the\u00a0short creation time, didn't get implemented. Here's a small list:<br/>- pick-ups (health, bombs, lasers, on-hit-kill, etc.)<br/>- boss battles<br/>- ship upgrades<br/>- other game-modes (timed challenges, pre-made levels, etc.)<br/>- way more and more interesting, mixed enemy squad setups (currently \"only\" has 12)<br/>- some kind of story and ending<br/>- custom music for the game<br/>- an options menu...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4b/f4ba74f2e8b8822862e5f977882ea34e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenJoe72"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
