Matt\u2019s project used the type-effectiveness mechanic of the Pok\u00e9mon series to create a cellular automaton. Each cell is occupied by one of the 15 Pok\u00e9mon types and battles its neighbors each step to determine the new resident of that cell.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This project expands upon Matt\u2019s idea to include all 151 original Pok\u00e9mon, their types, and their individual statistics. Each cell is occupied by a Pok\u00e9mon which must battle all eight of its neighbors every step. Of the eight winners, one is chosen at random to be the new resident of that cell. Battle calculations are faithful to the original Generation I GBC games, including considerations for type effectiveness, critical hits, and more. The only theoretical aspect of battle is the available set of moves for each Pok\u00e9mon, which has been standardized and balanced for a more consistent simulation.<br/></p>\n<p>See the \"About\" page in-game for more information and the \"Observations\" page for recommended rule-sets.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:19:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46d0dc711ccdfa6f6422c8dd99429660.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SnailOnAShip"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
