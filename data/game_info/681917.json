You can feel the hum of their secrets. Their pulses of light are so clearly telling you where to go and who to meet. Your lover. Your destiny. You leave your home planet and travel to the location the stars told you to go. You can see them there, at the meeting site. Their craft looks so alien down there. Their form is incomprehensible to you. But you know no worries. The aeons and cosmos have been turning their gears and pulling their strings to make this meeting happen. You know the expanse of the universe is pulsing with your beating heart(s). You can make this work. No matter how different their language, their sense and their anatomy, your love is true.</em>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You and your partner(s) will experience love as a choice and a series of actions rather than just a feeling. You will practice the act of love when you don\u2019t understand your partner or yourself. For some this will be a more familiar task than for others. Those who are part of a marginalized group and have been forced to go on paths of self discovery should have their experience and skill be highly valued in this game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T06:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1c/d1c45c9b670085e3642e8f4ab1907617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CStrange"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
