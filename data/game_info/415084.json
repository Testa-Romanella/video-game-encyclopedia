The game-play brings the player through boss fight after boss fight, only allowing them to go to a shop along the way.\u00a0 Inanis draws inspiration from games like Slay the Spire, Cup-head, and Dark Souls, drawing together many concepts to create a punishing product. Combat is based around being blind to the enemies intentions. Unlike other deck-builders, the only way to penetrate the fog of battle is through memorization and skill.</p>\n<p>This Demo includes:</p>\n<ul><li>The first Area</li><li>5 bosses</li><li>The first character</li><li>Curses, a shop, and over 50 cards</li><li>A myriad of bugs and balancing issues!</li></ul>\n<p>Any and all comments and suggestions are appreciated, and you can follow my progress at\u00a0https://twitter.com/TheBlazingOak</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T06:11:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db8ed76399839dce0619f5e05e5cd786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gabriel.Hatcher"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
