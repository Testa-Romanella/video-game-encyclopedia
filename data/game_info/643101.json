{"id": 643101, "slug": "amity-island", "name": "Amity Island", "name_original": "Amity Island", "description": "<p><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Amity Island </em>is a survival\u00a0\u00a0FPS game with RPG and action-adventure elements\u00a0made as a final group assignment as a part of game development education. The primary plan is to present all knowledge we acquired during six months of education through developing a demo version. If the demo version would gain positive feedback from players, our mentor, and the developing team we would make a full game we have already a storyline and plan of development. For now, the plan is to develop the tutorial level and first level with the same character which appears at the tutorial level. This is a basic game design document and choices regarding game design and mechanics can be made as we progress through developing the project. Dejan Seretinek will be doing game design, 3d modeling, and level design, Sa\u0161a Borojevi\u0107 will be doing level design and UI, Domagoj Petrovi\u0107 and Florijan Hen\u010del will be programmers. Due to the lot of work, we are open to finding additional people for the project.\u00a0 To make the project authentic among numerous survival games our plan is to make the game has elements of modern RPG.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0With the ever-growing popularity of the survival game genre in order to gain recognition on market, we plan to develop a lot of original ideas through games based mostly on putting elements of modern RPG and comedy elements based on comedy movies and shows. The game plot in the first phase of the game is set on Amity Island. The name is used for a fictional island from the motion picture <em>Jaws </em>directed by Steven Spielberg. The main focus of the game is to make the atmosphere of an isolated island similar to islands in the Adriatic Sea like Bra\u010d, Hvar, or Kor\u010dula. Movies from Cornetto trilogy <em>Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, </em>and <em>End Of The World </em>than movies like <em>Zombieland, From Dusk Till Dawn, Night Of The Living Dead,\u00a0</em>or TV shows like <em>Simpsons </em>or <em>Southpark </em>are the main influences through games and direction how to make it unique. Also, the game is influenced by popular conspiracy theories which are presented in a humoristic way like in TV shows like <em>Southpark </em>or <em>Black Mirror.</em> Also, many characters in the game are based on real people. Instead of animations, we decided to put animated comics so the game will have a switch from comic looks too realistic.\u00a0From music, we are open to promote unlabeled music artists or street musicians who would like to be promoted on our game. We are using tracks from\u00a0progressive rock band Sixes from Kor\u010dula and\u00a0rock band\u00a0<em>Plodovi Mozga (Fruita di Brain). </em>Also game designer produced some songs for fun in Fruity Loops to use in the game.\u00a0The game contains RPG elements with action-adventure and shooter elements. The player could choose from the First Person view and the Third Person view. The main influences to this game are the\u00a0<em>Resident Evil</em> serial, <em>Last Of Us</em> and <em>Days Gone, Rust, Scum,\u00a0</em>and <em>Forrest</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game goal is to protect are and characters from various threats ranging from zombies, monsters, and enemy soldiers and minions. That includes doing primary and secondary objectives through levels. The game will also have side quests and mini-games. The game has elements of modern RPG where each character will have different roles in the further game storyline for example policeman Eric is like a modern time Paladin from the Diablo series, he possesses strong will and discipline, and moral integrity of the group.\u00a0 Computer hacker Agata is like a modern sorcerer with her knowledge in technology. Her knowledge will be used to disable control levels in certain areas open doors or get certain information from other servers or computers with hacking. Later she can hack on some computers to gain information about some secret projects but also to steal money but as the game progresses money will drastically lose value to your group and the matter of survival will be crucial.\u00a0 \u00a0Doctor Jacob is like a modern time healer. He can help other members of the party and help with medical treatment of other NPC\u2019s and complete side quests by helping other people. Ying is like a blade master unit that relies on cold weapons and martial arts. Maybe mostly similar to the barbarian class in Diablo or Blade master from Warcraft 3 but very authentic. Her biggest advantage is her speed and she is shorter than the rest of the group so she can take some tasks which involve stealth and going through specific areas. All members of the group start separately their gameplay stories of how they got involved in the middle of virus infection and they got together in a party. In the first couple of levels, you play with every character solo gameplay, and later as the plot develops they got together in the safe zone. The safe zone is the local hospital where are their headquarters from where they go to different missions across the island. Some missions are very unusual for example first mission when you play with a policeman is to find the person which called for help but his car got hit by something unusual and broken down as he finds himself into a mutant infection danger zone where traveling circus has their tents. As he finds a way to escape the area his only option to escape quickly is to find the car <em>Yugo </em>which keys he has found as he knows the coordinates of the car. You have NPC\u2019s through the game which are locals where you can buy stuff like weapons, health kits, or other things. Some NPC\u2019s gave you side quests to complete which if you accomplish them gives you various bonuses. At the beginning of the game, you control one character at a time but later you can control more of them. We are open to making a multiplayer option but in the future. Defense of the HQ is one of the crucial objects of the game where you will need to organize defense by gaining all kinds of materials like barricades, automatic weapons, ballistic weapons, and people who could help you. Also helping injured people is very important because it gives various bonuses. Advancing to higher levels also gives you additional bonuses. Gameplay includes gathering all kinds of resources in order for your party to survive including people you are taking care of. Carrying materials depends on available spots in inventory.   </p>\n<p>The plot of the game is about survival on an Island and later in a city area after failed military experiments resulted in a large population turned into zombies or mutants.\u00a0 Although it sounds very generic game has a very complex storyline filled with plot twists and character development inside of the storyline. The plot of the game is a mix of\u00a0zombie apocalypse movies, conspiracy theories, science fiction packed with a lot of dark humor in order to make it as much authentic it can be among survival games that are very present in the present-day gaming scene.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<strong>Control Scheme</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Controls are typical for the First Person Shooter type of game.
