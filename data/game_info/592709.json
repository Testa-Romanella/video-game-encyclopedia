{"id": 592709, "slug": "grey-mirrors", "name": "Grey Mirrors", "name_original": "Grey Mirrors", "description": "<p>In most single-player platformers you control a single player at once. This format has been around for decades and it's getting dull.</p>\n<p>In Grey Mirrors, you control not one but TWO players at once. One of them behaves normally and the other does everything mirrored. Each player has their own finish point, and both players need to be touching their finish point at the same time to finish the level. These two mechanics, despite this simplicity, lead to some interesting gameplay where you have to use the items in the level to align the players with their finish points<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created for the Gamedev.js Jam 2021, and so is written entirely in JavaScript. Rendering is provided by\u00a0the pixi.js library, which is controlled by my wrk.js library. Images were made using Graphics Gale and the soundtrack was made using Bosca Ceoil.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T10:42:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06e6cf1bdf93e57337e3558ad80afe9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ThatCoolCoder"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
