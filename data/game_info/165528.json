If any errors or bugs occur, don\u2019t hesitate to contact me at OfficialSurviveGame@gmail.com or leave a comment to discuss\u00a0communication with me or about the game. The purpose of the game is to enjoy it, the second purpose is to interest. If you are even slightly interested in how this game was made and developed, read my code and if you can try to code your own. Very few developers and programmers allow the public to see code on their product, but I do and I want you to understand what computer programming is and what can be made from it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05c/05c227e9e9409a44c24aced4fe5c4cd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hugh"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
