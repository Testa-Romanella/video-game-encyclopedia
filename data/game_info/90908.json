The project ended up being a bit too big for us to actually properly finish, we wanted to do so much more with the concept! Our team just wasn't experienced enough in making vidgams.</p><p>So yeah that's why we decided to release the project in its current state, hoping someone would enjoy playing it despite the rough edges!</p><p>Florian, Alexandre, Martin, Felix &amp; Baptiste</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/009/00977160e119a86d0c4f2cb2b34ba696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Florian Veltman", "AlexTai"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
