WARNING: This is a project for school and is very unbalanced and buggy</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The goal is to fend off the evil hoards invading the land! Place towers and earn gold to survive as long as possible! when the game starts you have 10 seconds to prepare then the enemies start spawning. You can click on the spinning coin to get gold, once you have enough you can buy towers and upgrades which give you a number of gold per second! as a side not everytime you buy something the cost doubles! If you want to see somethings stats then just hover over it!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- Art: JuicyFruit22</p>\n<p>- Development: LRD</p>\n<p>- Font: Kenney</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>There is online leaderboards. please keep your username appropriate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T07:59:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8c/e8caea644ee45bcb20c43ce0fa6d3d06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LRD"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
