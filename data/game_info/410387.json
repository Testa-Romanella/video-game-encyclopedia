There is a coin within each stage which if you collect in all stages, it will unlock the final bonus level. The bonus level is much more difficult and challenging - it even took me ages to complete it!</p>\n<p>Make sure to share the game and leave any feedback. Feel free to use this game in any video without restrictions.
