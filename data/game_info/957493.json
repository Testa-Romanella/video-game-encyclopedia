Defend your base at all times and completely destroy any enemy that stands in front of you but... With a gratifying number of missions, challenges and mini-games we can forget about those repetitive experiences:<br/><br/><br/><strong>ENEMY ATTACK</strong><br/>Simple missions where you have to defend your base and destroy all enemies.<br/><br/><strong>STATION CAPTURE</strong><br/>Mission in which you must retake control of neutral stations before the enemy destroys them.<br/><br/><strong>ESCAPE</strong><br/>Mission in which you must dodge obstacles, destroy barriers and enemies, evade turret attacks and more, all while being chased by a powerful explosion.<br/><br/><strong>MINIBOSS AND BOSS ATTACK</strong><br/>The name is more than enough, but it is important to mention that each of these rivals has unique mechanics, random patterns and others not so random, weak points and strategies that require great skill.<br/><br/><strong>COMBAT EVENTS</strong><br/>If you like risky decisions this is for you, random missions where you will have 4 choices with possible positive, neutral or catastrophic outcomes and that will commonly trigger battles or combat challenges.<br/><br/><strong> OPPORTUNITY EVENTS</strong><br/>Similar to combat events but here the choices can take you from huge credit rewards or unique boosts to automatic damage to your base or the loss of all your upgrades.<br/><br/><strong>ASSAULT TO STATIONS</strong><br/>Massive combats against enemy stations with the support of allied ships in unique conditions.<br/><br/><strong>ISOLATED LOOTS</strong><br/>Magnificent rewards in which you must decide whether to take the easy path and get a safe but simple reward or choose the path of the samurai and put your skills to the test with unique mini-games, battles or challenges to get powerful rewards.<br/><br/><strong>REFUELING STATIONS</strong><br/>What better way to describe this than space shops and markets, buy upgrades or weapons, repair your base or recharge shields.<br/><h3>True Enemy Protocol</h3>Your worst nightmare comes true: a rival that will evolve along with your game. You can choose between two versions:<br/><br/><br/><strong>Simple:</strong>Let's avoid spoilers, so I'll just mention that it has the ability to annoy you at almost any time, plan ambushes, interfere in a battle, sabotage your base and even make you lose some rewards.<br/><br/><strong>Complete:</strong>If you really want to suffer, welcome to hell. Just like simple mode but on steroids: it will have almost human capabilities, it will be able to make you suffer in unique ways like a real rival, it will strategize at the level of a genius and will make you feel afraid of his mere presence - of course without being an invincible or super powerful enemy.<br/><br/><h3>Upgrading System</h3>When you start each run you will start the same way, with your basic ship and preset weapons, but there are ways to improve it so you can progress through each game and each difficulty level.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Unlockables:</strong>At the end of each game you will get temporary fragments that you can use to unlock new weapons, ships, pilots, bases, stations, missions, improvements and much more.<br/><br/><strong>Master Level System:</strong>Everything in this adventure can level up as you use it, weapons, ships, pilots and main bases will improve minimally with each fight permanently.<br/><br/><strong>Basic Power-ups:</strong>Powerful upgrades to choose from for every win or reward, choose wisely.<br/><br/><strong>Elite power-ups:</strong>Even more powerful than the Basic ones, they significantly change the way your weapons work and open the way to new strategies.<br/><h3>Implementation for Twitch</h3>Link your account and allow your audience to participate in your destiny.<br/><br/>They will vote to decide your fate: good, bad, terrible, what could go wrong?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T08:31:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d87a9d416c8fcd3480155afd0a2e7612.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100088907126548", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan Fortino Hernandez Silva", "Lucila Giammatteo"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jonathan Fortino Hernandez Silva"], "esrb_rating": null}
