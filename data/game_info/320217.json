It's focused on deliberate, combo-driven combat and some limited platforming.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s playable with both keyboard/ mouse and controller; I think it feels better with the latter.\u00a0Aside from the rig/ model, I did every aspect of the project myself, including the motion-capture, animation clean-up and Unreal blueprints (though, tutorials were helpful with the latter). The focus is mainly on the animation and how it's implemented into a real game environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It plays like a fairly standard third-person action title but the controls can be found below. They can also be seen, alongside\u00a0descriptions of some of the more atypical mechanics, in-game via a <em>Help Menu</em>\u00a0and in the '<em>Controls Document'</em> provided.</p>\n\n<p>Controls\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n      </p> <p><strong>Keyboard</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Controller</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Move   Character</strong>\n</p> <p>W, A, S, D\r\n      </p> <p>Left Stick\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Move   Camera</strong>\n</p> <p>Mouse\r\n      </p> <p>Right Stick\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Jump</strong>\n</p> <p>Spacebar\r\n      </p> <p>A\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Light   Attack (Hold)</strong>\n</p> <p>Left Mouse Button (LMB)\r\n      </p> <p>X\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Heavy   Attack</strong>\n</p> <p>Right Mouse Button (RMB)\r\n      </p> <p>Y\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Block   (Hold)</strong>\n</p> <p>Q\r\n      </p> <p>B\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Dash</strong>\n</p> <p>Left Shift\r\n      </p> <p>Right Trigger (RT)\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Lock-on</strong>\n</p> <p>E\r\n      </p> <p>Left Trigger (LT)\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Lock-on   Cycle Left</strong>\n</p> <p>Tab\r\n      </p> <p>Left Bumper (LB)\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Lock-on   Cycle Right</strong>\n</p> <p>R\r\n      </p> <p>Right Bumper (RB)\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Power   Up/ Down</strong>\n</p> <p>Alt\r\n      </p> <p>Up (D-Pad)\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Harm</strong>\n</p> <p>Right Shift\r\n      </p> <p>Down (D-Pad)\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Help   Menu</strong>\n</p> <p>H\r\n      </p> <p>View\r\n     </p> <p><strong>Quit   Game</strong>\n</p> <p>Esc\r\n      </p> <p>Menu\r\n     </p>\n\n<p>Rig/ Model:<br/>Henleyernest.
