It fits in to the theme because the drone is deceiving you AKA not telling what is real. The ending also fits in but that's a spoiler.</p>\n<p>There are also 2 secrets,\u00a0let me know if you find any!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:23:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/93480729b66943c77c5b83105dd0e76c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Chimplement"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
