But when Spicetown Industries\u00a0discovered the animating power of\u00a0Capsaicin238, things started to heat back up. An army of sentient chili peppers overran the salsa conglomerate and\u00a0began to infiltrate the deserts, lagoons, and heartlands of the old west, turning it into a salsa-filled wasteland. It all came down to 1 to 4 online, co-op cowboys to save the world, and maybe, just maybe, the west they once knew.</p>\n<p>Because Heatwave is in active development, there are definitely bugs, and features are subject to change. We're still adding maps, pepper species, weapons, and power-ups as we go!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Join the Alpha?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Play and stream Heatwave before anyone else</li><li>Participate in monthly leaderboard prizes</li><li>Automatic updates through the new itch.io client</li><li>Get every announcement first</li><li>Even more secrets and surprises inside!</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Special Launch Week Bonus:\u00a0</strong>Get Serrano (VIP) status in the discord if you join before December 4th!</p>\n\r\nHow it works\r\n<ul><li>Waves of chili peppers will rain down upon you</li><li>Shoot them, or die</li><li>If you get down, a friend can revive you</li><li>If that fails, you're back in (minus your guns) the next wave</li><li>If everyone gets down, welp partner, you're smoked.</li></ul>\n\r\nLeaderboard\r\n\n<p>That's right partner, there's a leaderboard.
