Source files don't exist anymore.\u00a0<br/><br/>Through this project I\u00a0learned a lot about UI, composition, co-op systems, third-person controllers and animation. In retrospect, this is simply crude\u00a0- now I could\u00a0do much better in a weekend. Still, I like going back once in a while and retracing my steps and exploring my old mistakes.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T19:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c1/5c17a8e6642b1881416e9ebfdad35718.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick A.
