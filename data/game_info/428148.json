Humanity lost a galactic war and is forced to hide. They send colonial ships across the galaxy to start new points of growth and to keep mankind safe from the seeking enemy.<br/><br/><br/>You are a human-pilot of one such ship that suddenly got tracked. The AI ripped you from the long anabiosis and now you have to build the paths through the most dangerous places in order to outrun your pursuers.<br/><br/>Luckily, there is a legacy simulation system that will help you avoiding vital mistakes.<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>Unlanded is a short level-based thrust-vector game where you control a spaceship motion. It is intended to be challenging and requires a feel of inertia and thrust. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Currently, there are 25 levels divided into 2 locations (the third location with 9 more levels is at the development stage).", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T12:31:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d25929bcdac432d52e6b0bed389be1dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Borys Koreniev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Borys Koreniev"], "esrb_rating": null}
