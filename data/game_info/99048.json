You sensed that the gates to the Void have opened and rushed to stop the invasion of monsters on your beautiful world. You are tasked in stopping whatever will pour out of the portal.</p>\n<p>You manifest yourself via the mouse and where you point the wisp follows. The wisp burns the monsters on touch and therefore is your main weapon. But beware. The monsters are able to disrupt your wisp. Enough damage and the wisp dissolves. While the wisp is being resurrected you can choose a godly power you can send on the enemies below. But if all resurrections run out you fail the quest and let the world be overrun by monsters.</p>\n<p>This game has been a first attempt at creating something from scratch by a small team of game development enthusiasts. We want to learn more and create better content in the future so all constructive comments are welcome.</p>\n<p>Greetings from the Otherworld!
