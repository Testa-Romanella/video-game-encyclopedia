This is my second game I've finished, so be prepared for some JANK. Keyboard and controller input is supported, but I highly recommend using a controller. Also there's a huge difficulty spike between the fourth and last level because I was gonna add more levels, but like nah.</p>\n<p>There are pretty much no textures or sprites used in this game, almost everything is used with default Unity assets. But as a great man once said, \"who even needs sprites when you have post processing\" -George Washingmachine</p>\n<p>This game had absolutely no playtesting until now, and I already have a long list of issues that need to be solved, but that will come in a 1.1 update.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T09:46:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/108f263c735f36d2d64f5127874120cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sushi"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
