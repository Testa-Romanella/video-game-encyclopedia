However, not only do the players, or \"Reflections\", mirror each others movements, but they are also placed on opposite sides with different terrain. Your goal is to reach the end of the level, and you may continue even if only one reaches the goal. However, if one of them dies, both of them do. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy the game!!</p><p>(9 Levels, they're pretty hard)</p>\n<p>!! NOTE: for proper scaling of assets, run game in 1920x1080p resolution!!</p>\n\n<p>Game was made in the Unity Game Engine for the GMTK Game Jam by IndieWolf Games 2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acf0811ddb703b7d9ce3f7629d75a6b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrIndieWolf"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
