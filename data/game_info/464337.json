The idea is that these solar systems are unstable or \"out of control\" and the player has to keep them under control for a short time to go to the next solar system. The player can try to keep the system in balance by\u00a0applying small amounts of force on the planets. The player can apply force by clicking on a planet and launching them in a direction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:51:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df764c81b40237703eae97cee79b1af1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SemLaan", "BeefBall"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
