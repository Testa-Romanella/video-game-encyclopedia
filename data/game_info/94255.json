ALL of the stones of EACH colour must be connected in a single 'group' in order for them to vanish, ie. you cannot have multiple, unconnected groups of the same colour in different areas of the screen. The big challenge in <strong>GRAVITRIX</strong> is that the stones don't just have different colours - they have different 'directions' (or gravity) as well!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEach coloured stone 'falls' in its assigned direction (symbolised by an arrow) whenever there is nothing blocking its path, and this leads to some tricky chain reactions that must be solved. To make your life even harder there is also a time limit, environmental blocks and other gameplay elements that are introduced during the early levels.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GRAVITRIX</strong> features:<br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hours of puzzle-solving action!</li>\n<li>Two 5.25\" floppy disks worth of artwork and music!</li>\n<li>Password save system!</li>\n<li>Super-fast loading (512KB cartridge version only)!</li>\n<li>Full NTSC/PAL support!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For further information on the game, please check the\u00a0press kit.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Buy <strong>GRAVITRIX</strong> on Cartridge for your Commodore 64 Computer!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tEnjoyed \r\n\t<strong><strong>GRAVITRIX</strong></strong> on your modern-day PC? Have an old Commodore 64 stashed away in the loft? Well, you'd be a fool not to grab a physical copy of the C64 version - it comes boxed with a poster, codesheets, little vinyl stickers and everything, just like in the good old days!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t(This initial run is limited to 50 individually numbered copies. Further batches will only be produced if there is sufficient demand).\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHead on over to our \r\n\tonline store to order your copy today :)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><strong><strong><em><strong><strong>GRAVITRIX</strong></strong></em></strong></strong></strong><em> is also available to order on 5.25\" diskette from our comrades at Psytronik Software via their Binary Zone store.</em>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\r\n\t\tPlease note that the downloadable Commodore 64 version available here is primarily for use with emulators, but can also be run on a real C64 via hardware such as the \r\n\t1541 Ultimate II.
