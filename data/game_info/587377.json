The road to freedom is going to be a never-ending uphill struggle.</p>\n<p>The imposition of the National Security Law in July 2020 has sealed Hong Kong\u2019s fate. The <em>One Country, Two Systems</em> principle delineated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration has been blatantly disregarded by the Chinese government. Citizens, activists, and even legislators have been arrested en mass on subversion, sedition, or collusion charges. Perhaps truth through subversive irreverence is the only way we will be allowed to tell our story from now on.</p>\n<p>There is a Chinese saying: <em>throwing eggs at a rock</em>. What can we do in face of inevitability? How do we adapt and keep fighting? How do we keep our stories alive in spite of the oppressive National Security Law threatening our lives and future?</p>\n<p>This project is a collection of what was, what has been, what is, and what could be. This is written from the vantage point of somebody who is homesick more than ever. This is a rally for the ones who are still risking their lives out there. This is written in remembrance of those who cannot be there anymore. This is a lament of families broken and loves forever lost. This is a warning for anyone who would listen, and for those who would not. Whatever it is, yesterday feels so long ago, and yet tomorrow seems farther away still.</p>\n<p>Revolution is a process. Revolution takes generations. We fight, so that our children\u2019s children can keep fighting the good fight. For freedom. For justice. For truth. For love. Take action. Do something even when you can\u2019t. We must keep on. We must never forget.</p>\n\r\nGFHG SDGM", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T09:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab02ce8a6476e524b42b8022eaf84897.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["uncle chan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
