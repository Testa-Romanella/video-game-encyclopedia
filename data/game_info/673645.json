It has WIP things like temporary UI and incomplete features. This is NOT a complete game, please don't mistake it for that! The servers are NOT on yet. Only during play tests.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Join the Discord\u00a0\ud83d\udc49 [https://discord.gg/smvhW9t] for more info on play tests.</p>\n<p>Hello and welcome to our little itch.io page! This page should (hopefully) have all the information you need on it to tell you what our game is about. If not, somebody didn't do their job properly!</p>\n<p><strong>AEGIS Kingdoms</strong> is a <strong>TMORPG</strong>\u00a0<em>(Tiny Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)</em>. It's an online RPG with a small community vibe.<br/>It is free to play, with <em><strong>no pay to win aspects</strong></em>. In the future there will be cash-shop items that you can buy to support the game, but that is optional. It is important to note that this game also uses a mixture of store and original assets, and feels incredibly \"indie\". It is in pre-alpha, and we are opening the servers and\u00a0doing play tests at the moment with every update leading up to our first big DECEMBER in-game event.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that this game is still very WIP, as and such things are changing a lot as we continue to build the game. The first alpha build of the game is tailored to our first in-game event, and then we will be releasing subsequent updates to expand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please join our lil Discord if you'd like to know more about when each play test is, as we'll be announcing that over <strong>Discord</strong>. We also host impromptu tests, too. <strong>For absolute clarity: the servers are NOT open all the time.</strong></p>\n<p>[https://discord.gg/smvhW9t]</p>\n\n<p><strong>A BRIEF </strong><strong>HISTORY</strong>:<br/>AEGIS Kingdoms has been built specifically for the AEGIS Discord community. <br/>Originally we were a group of gamers who met online from various games and formed an awesome little discord.\u00a0For the last 3 years we have been looking at private servers and game servers in order to have a \"physical space\" to hang out in, and also grow our community. We're strong believers that the best way for a community to grow is to have something in common, and normally a certain game or interest brings people together quite quickly!\u00a0Unfortunately no game quite suited our needs or was too limited in what we could do, so we sat down and built our own little game to play on.<br/></p>\n<p>It's not just about having an online space to hangout in, but we also wanted to create a \"home game\" for our community.\u00a0 BJPickles comes from a background of private servers and private server communities. He has met some of his closest friends on these places, and so AEGIS Kingdoms has been built to function like a private server: a place for you to have a fun time, meet new people,\u00a0enjoy the game with everyone and even contribute to the wellbeing of the game by taking on user roles like in-game helpers etc for new players.</p>\n<p>We know that some players become very passionate about the games you play, especially your \"home game\". We want to work with you to make the game better, and organise awesome community led events, too. In fact our whole ethos is about a community based development focus because at the end of the day, you're the ones who'll be playing the game with us, and yes - absolutely - we will be playing AEGIS Kingdoms as much as you will.<br/></p>\n<p>The bottom line is that AEGIS Kingdoms has been built to be played, and we want anyone who is interested to have the best experience on our little game as possible. We may not always get it right, but sometimes it's more about the journey than the destination.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong>:<br/>AEGIS Kingdoms is a third person ARPG, with accompanying hot-bar abilities. You're able to customize your character, level up, apply skill points, use the chat, trade with other players, create guilds, PvP, PvE and even ride animals if you want to. There is questing, item repairs, generic tomfoolery and just your average indie RPG experience. You earn gold and EXP for killing things, and you spend that lovely gold on shiny things that make you look cool.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, our PHASE 1 (read: Alpha) milestone\u00a0is launching our first community in-game PvPvE event, which we call our \"Community Clashes\". This is a long standing tradition for the AEGIS community, and is a great way to test out the AEGIS Kingdoms platform, see how the server performs and generally just a good bitesize milestone to achieve rather than try and release a full online open world game, because that isn't realistic.</p>\n<p>We originally custom made a game each time we hosted a community clash, and this time we are doing the same with AEGIS Kingdoms. It boasts new features that weren't present in our former games and works like this:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Community Clashes are PvP events</strong>: Community Clash #3 will specifically be a Free For All PvP battle.<br/>\u200e</li><li><strong>Community Clash #3 will be\u00a0PvPvE</strong>: Unlike other clashes we've had, this will be the first Clash\u2122 with mobs (enemy monsters) of varying difficulty. You will have to watch out as they will try to kill you as much as the other players.<br/>\u200e</li><li><strong>Community Clash #3 will be an elimination round</strong>: Unlike other clashes where players have been able to respawn, this time you will only have ONE LIFE. Once you die or are killed, you'll be placed in the Afterlife: a piratey themed island for the dead until the end of the event.<br/>\u200e</li><li><strong>Community Clash events only have 1 winner</strong>: In this case it will be a single person, but in other events it could be teams/guilds etc.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>THE EVENT WILL GO DOWN LIKE THIS</strong>:</p>\n<ol><li>The Community Clash\u2122 is announced in our Discord and other socials for a specific time and date.</li><li>On the date of the Clash\u2122, the servers will go live.</li><li>You'll create your own account, and be able to login.</li><li>You create your character. Note, this character is specifically for the community clash and is separate from the main TMORPG.</li><li>Once in-game, Admins and Moderators will be directing players and helping them. You'll have a little while to get used to the game before the event starts.</li><li>Once everyone is ready, the practice round will begin. It will be the same as though the official event, but it helps you get used to the game.</li><li>The practice round will conclude. Player progress will be wiped, and you will have to create a new character.</li><li>The official round will begin.</li><li>The champion (winner) will be announced.</li></ol>\n<p>Oh look, it's the bottom of the page!<br/>If you've got this far, there's a fair chance you may be interested in this project. We're always looking for amazing new people to join our community, so please consider joining our Discord. We play games together, have fun and generally just enjoy each other's company!<br/></p>\n<p>AEGIS Kingdoms will release into it's own full TMORPG (Tiny Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) at some point in the future, but we aren't in any rush. With every update, we'll continue to improve the game and little by little,\u00a0 it'll grow into it's own thing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T08:43:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de4ade3f613279dd557aeb557c363214.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 482, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BJPickles"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
