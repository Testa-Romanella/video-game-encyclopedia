You are Gobbo, and you must defeat all the other Imposter Gobbos by any means necessary. Whether that means blowing them up, poisoning them, binding them in ice, or launching them into the abyss with a well-placed gust of wind is up to you. You can mix 4 different colors of Crystal Juice to make 10 unique different potions.</p>\n<p>This game is multiplayer only, it requires at least 2 people to play, but you can technically have as many people in your game as you want (we have not stress tested this). It is HIGHLY recommended to use an Xbox Controller, but mouse and keyboard should work as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have 3 lives, the last Gobbo standing wins!</p>\n<p>3rd Party/ Re-used Assets list for JointJam:</p>\n<p>-All particle effects except the\u00a0Wind Columns and Leaf Clouds are from an Asset Pack owned by\u00a0Noa Baggs</p>\n<p>-The multiplayer framework code was re-used from an old project, but all the net code was custom-made for GobboVersus</p>\n<p>-All audio was obtained from pre-owned asset packs or freesound.org</p>\n<p>-The base mesh for the player character (Gobbo) was re-used from an old project but was very heavily altered.</p>\n<p>-All of Gobbo's animations are from Mixamo</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Noa Baggs - Art</p>\n<p>Joseph\u00a0 DeMartini - Programmer</p>\n<p>Cole Montrose - Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T11:04:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31e/31e2afed8ff191e81f2979fa9bbff031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cole", "Joseph DeMartini", "ttmayor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
