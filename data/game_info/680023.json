Some might learn to farm algae, other might <strong>start to bait</strong> less harmful fish... who knows..? There is no limit to the interaction of the fish and every evolution of species can bring new features. Make sure you select your fish carefully and only breed the fittest, so you can compete against the other fish.<br/>It's up to you and your fish to <strong>cooperate with other players</strong> or just <strong>defeat them</strong>- but be warned: Your fish are getting intelligent. They might have their own will soon!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T02:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cc/6ccd3e64a4b67cbe0c25ac9b6217c791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Joachim Sester", "Niels ten Dijke"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Joachim Sester", "Niels ten Dijke"], "esrb_rating": null}
