The car drives through lovely gardens for over seventy meters, but when it stops at the mansion\u2019s front entrance, nobody steps out of the vehicle, as the butler patiently waits at the ready to welcome the vehicle\u2019s occupants. <br/><br/>The sound of someone shouting can be heard when the car door opens after a few minutes.<br/><br/>That\u2019s the last time I\u2019m putting up with your slurs and your insults, yelled Louis Versetti, son of the multimillionaire Paolo Versetti.<br/><br/>Very slowly and calmly, Louis\u2019 father steps out of the car after his son; he doesn\u2019t follow him, he just looks at him with a hard and dismissive stare. <br/><br/>You think I don\u2019t deserve any of this.  Do you think I\u2019m not worthy?  Okay, so that\u2019s the way it will be then; I will not accept a penny of your fortune; I will not accept anything that is yours.  I'm leaving this house right now!  Louis exclaimed energetically in a determined tone of voice, while his father just looked on with a smirk on his face, which, if anything, just provoked him all the more, making him even angrier. <br/><br/>Louis turns around slowly, and without hesitation begins to walk through the large garden, back towards the mansion\u2019s gate. No one makes a single sound; the only thing to be heard is the sound the shoes make as they walk down the paved driveway; those fine shoes which were manufactured in Italy, his father\u2019s native land. His father came to this country when he was very young and single-handedly became a millionaire in just ten years by creating multiple companies.<br/><br/>Louis is about to reach the gate, and all he\u2019s taking with him to face the world on his own is just a leather jacket and some money in his wallet.<br/><br/>I\u2019ll show him what I can accomplish on my own, thinks the 23-year-old, who feels he is ready to forge his own path in life. <br/><br/> Before leaving the grounds, he turns a little to the right to look at the small storage shed where old things are kept, and where he knows his old motorcycle is stored. It\u2019s been years since he last used it, so it must be very dusty and maybe even a little rusty, but Louis is almost certain that it still works. <br/><br/>Although Louis had been determined to leave on foot, he thinks it will be much better on that bike. He is about to go and pick up the motorcycle when he remembers it was a gift given to him by his father when he was 15 and stops in his tracks to think for a moment:<br/><br/>Choose his path wisely, what would you do?<br/><br/> This Interactive Book App is published by Living a Book.
