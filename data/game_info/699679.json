Casual gamers. Fantasy fans.\r\n</p>\n<p>Description: Voltis is a fantasy puzzle game with a charming low-poly style. To win, Voltis must make it through the exit to the maze using the light from his glowing tail to see the area. However, Voltis\u2019 glow won\u2019t last forever! Collect friendly glowbugs to keep your vision and try to get the best time for the solution.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement.\r\n</p>\n<p>Pointer - Rotation.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Important info: there is no functioning fail-screen at the moment. You have to collect glowbugs to stay moving, if your character stops moving - you have run out of energy and have to restart the game.]</strong></p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>The wonderful music is \u2018Eye\u2019 by Leanonthebeat (free use)\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Why did we create <em>this</em> game?\r\n</p>\n<p>We chose to create this game specifically after going over what experience we already have in the group. The game and media we chose to use challenged our team in areas we were not already too familiar with, while still being in the realm of what each of us would <em>like</em> to do. For example, we had a 2D artist create a 3D asset for the first time and a programmer working with parts of Unity they were not experienced in. This made our game not something firmly in our comfort zone but rather a fun challenge.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Future speculation:\r\n</p>\n<p>More levels with more complex mechanics, such as a player attack move and enemies around the maze.\r\n</p>\n<p>Collectables around the maze with achievements for complete collections for each level.\r\n</p>\n<p>Functioning time scoreboard for worldwide updating list of quickest times for each level.\r\nPhysics polishing with the character and colliders. Adding UI assets made.</p>\n<p>Team:\r\n</p>\n<p>Riju John (UK),\u00a0<br/>Hugo Jansson (EU),<br/>Ren Hurley (UK),<br/>Gaynor Larrigan (UK).</p>\n<p>Mentor:\r\n</p>\n<p>Gregor Gullwi (Sharkmob).\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Youtube gamplay video link: </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T06:55:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d60/d604e4b0439b4a8121d260094c8cc894.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ren Hurley", "TeaKoArts", "zbsgaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
