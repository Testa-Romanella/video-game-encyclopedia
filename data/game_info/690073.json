Find your way to the exit\u00a0through the level and install a virus in the door to destroy it and complete the level. Reduce the virus file size, issued at the beginning of the game by compressing it at file compressors. Enjoy through 5 different levels!</p>\n<p>*Game is still in development (early access)*</p>\n<p>A few bugs which have been discovered:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. error with the control stick, does not always move the character. Fix- take a break from moving the player for a second and try again.</p>\n<p>2. Random destruction of File compressors after use. They are supposed to be destroyed after using the same compressor for more than 3 times. Might be fixed in next update.</p>\n<p>3. On win, input is disabled but the player seems to continue moving without instruction.</p>\n<p>4. Problem with audio and particle effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:10:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfe/bfe45f5804b15f761d525aa090137f95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Haruko_36"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
