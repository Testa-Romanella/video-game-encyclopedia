Now, it's only pure survival and strategy that awaits you inside this more twisted schoolhouse. . .</p>\r\nObjective\r\n<p>Collect all 7 notebooks and exit the school, just like the original. Simple, right? NOT EVEN CLOSE.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This time around, Baldi got a cast of new friends to harass you. They have harder mechanics and creepy designs to prove that you have\u00a0little chance against Baldi's crew of friends.</p>\n<p>There's also some brand new items. You can gulp down a potion to get some speed (more than a Zesty Bar, in fact!), wave a stick to flip upside down and even use a remote to completely wipe Baldi off the face of the earth. . .for a while, anyway.</p>\n<p>Also, the school lighting will frequently change, just to keep things random and unique.</p>\n<p>So you think you can still survive Baldi's truly ultimate challenge?? WELL THEN, PLAY IT!!</p>\r\nThanks for checking out my mod!\r\n<p>This is my first official Baldi mod, and I truly worked hard to get it done for everyone to play. Even if you play it for just a few minutes, thank you SO MUCH for playing this game. It was an astounding journey developing this mod, and I hope you have the same feeling as you play through this mod!</p>\n<p>Also, I will do a few small updates, so keep an eye out for those.</p>\n\r\nHAVE FUN WITH BALDI'S ULTIMATE CHALLENGE!\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Micah McGonigal (mystman12)</strong><strong>\u00a0-\u00a0</strong>owns Baldi's Basics</p>\n<p><strong>Harold the Water Dropper -\u00a0</strong>created the mod<br/></p>\n<p><strong>My friend Spencer -\u00a0</strong>Clawbert character design<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Splinta -\u00a0</strong>Provided the Mrs. Pomp model, which I edited into Mrs. Sunny<br/></p>\n<p><strong>DOI MODDER, Rapparep, etc. -\u00a0</strong>Helped me add scripts and textures into my mod with their tutorials/assets<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Cady McGonigal -\u00a0</strong>composed the Kickstarter scores<br/></p>\r\nPrograms Used\r\n<ul><li>Audacity (for modding audio)</li><li>Anim8or (for Mrs. Sunny character)</li><li>DnSpy (for modding scripts/codes)</li><li>UABE (for modding textures)</li><li>UnityEx (for modding audio)</li><li>Microsoft Paint (for modding textures)</li><li>Piskel (for designing Clawbert)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T04:27:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f8a239204ae2ba2a1f45b932bc810ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harold"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
