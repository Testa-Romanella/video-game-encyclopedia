Check here!\r\n\r\nQuestion 1 name\r\nWhat gives with all of the hiking stuff?\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 1 answer\r\nThe hiking hobby was a misdirect to make you think she just went hiking. That is, until you found the keys (where did she go without her car?) and the chest full of unused hiking gear. Seems like it was a new hobby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2 name\r\nWhat was the significance of the flower?\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2 answer\r\nThe flower being fresh and new could indicate someone had put a fresh one in there recently. But smelling it tells you that it's just plastic, and is a misdirect for the date of disappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 3 name\r\nWhat was the significance of the photo?\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 3 answer\r\nThe photo shows that Sparrow had seen the Spider when she was out and about recently, and was nervous about it. She labeled it as her brother to hopefully confuse any bad actors who might try to clear her apartment of clues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 4 name\r\nWhat was the significance of the post-it notes?\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 4 answer\r\nOne note gives you the hint for where to get the house number. The red fish on another note is meant to be a red herring - a tiny clue that not everything in the room will be pertinent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 5 name\r\nWhat was the significance of all of the messages?\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 5 answer\r\nA couple of the messages give important info: the message from the 14th gives a number, the one from the 15th shows that she missed an event that day. The others are meant to reinforce items from the calendar and impart a lil bit of flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 6 name\r\nWhat was the significance of the carpet clue?\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 6 answer\r\nThe carpet was ripped, but the rest of the apartment was very tidy (and even the ski cap was repaired, so Sparrow's not the type to leave stuff like that go). The carpet rip must have happened when she couldn't fix it, i.e. during a scuffle in which she was kidnapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 7 name\r\nWhat was the significance of the garbage?\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 7 answer\r\nThe trash is starting to go off - it's been there for quite a while. Just an additional hint indicating that she didn't disappear within the last few days.\r\n\r\n\n<p>Got any other questions about the game content?
