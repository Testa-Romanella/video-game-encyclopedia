Shot strength  depends on how long you hold down the mouse button for (1 mark).  Projectile is shot once button released (1 mark). Projectile follows a  ballistic trajectory, i.e. like a ball thrown through the air (1 mark).\r\n   2\r\n Projectile aiming line\r\n Line shows direction of shot (1 mark). Line length represents shot strength (1 mark).\r\n   2\r\n Projectile collisions\r\n Projectiles collide with the terrain,  obstacles, and the enemy (1 mark). Projectiles create an explosion at a  predefined radius (1 mark).\r\n   2\r\n Projectile damage / enemy health\r\n Projectiles do damage based on the distance  between the collision point and the enemy. A direct hit should kill the  enemy (1 mark) and the enemy should not be damaged if outside the  explosion radius (1 mark).\u00a0\r\n   2\r\n Ammo\r\n The player should start each level with 10 ammo (1 mark). Each shot should reduce the ammo count by one (1 mark).\r\n   2\r\n Level completion / game over\r\n The level ends in two ways: when the player  has run out of ammo (and the enemy is still alive) (1 mark), and when  the enemy's health has been depleted (1 mark).<br/>\n\n<strong>Extra Functionality (all levels)</strong>\n<strong>7%</strong>\r\n   4\r\n Visual style and feel\r\n Game is aesthetically pleasing, and levels play well.\r\n   1\r\n Trail\r\n Projectile has a trail (1 mark).\r\n    2\r\n Post processing\r\n Effect (or effects) matches overall visual style of game (2 marks).\r\n  \r\n<strong>User Interface (all levels)</strong>\n<strong>15%</strong>\r\n   5\r\n Title screen with level select\r\n Can be same or separate scenes (note that if using separate scenes, SceneSwitcherKeys script will need to be modified -- see exam lecture).\r\n   2\r\n In-game UI\r\n The enemy's health is visually shown (1 mark). The amount of ammo remaining is visually shown (1 mark).\r\n   3\r\n Start of level text\r\n Display a message for 2 seconds: level number  and title (1 mark), brief description of that level's mechanics (1  mark). Animated (1 mark).\r\n   3\r\n End of level text\r\n Display a congratulations screen for 3 seconds  after a level is completed (1 mark). Message should be from a random  set of messages of your choosing (1 mark). Shows statistics about how  many shots were needed to finish the level (1 mark).\r\n     2\r\n Game mechanics locked\r\n Can't aim (1 mark) or shoot (1 mark) while the start or end level text is being shown.\r\n\r\n<strong>Level 1 \u2013 Default</strong>\n<strong>2%</strong>\r\n   2\r\n Functionality\r\n Simple level with no modifications.\r\n\r\n<strong>Level 2 \u2013 Black Hole</strong>\n<strong>2%</strong>\r\n   2\r\n Functionality\r\n Sucks projectiles towards it (1 mark), and is fun to play (1 mark).\r\n\r\n<strong>Level 3 \u2013 Homing Missiles</strong>\n<strong>5%</strong>\r\n   4\r\n Functionality\r\n Projectiles move on normal (i.e. ballistic)  trajectory for one second (1) and then starts homing towards the enemy  (1 mark). Turning towards the enemy should be gradual (1 mark) and  homing missiles should not exceed original projectile's initial speed (1  mark) -- this isn't realistic, but is more fun to watch.\r\n   1\r\n Visual Feedback\r\n Homing missile should have a visual representation of the change from ballistic movement to homing movement (1 mark).\r\n\r\n<strong>Level 4 \u2013 Shield</strong>\n<strong>4%</strong>\r\n   2\r\n Shield\r\n Enemy has a shield that must be hit three times (1 mark) before enemy can be destroyed (1 mark).\r\n   2\r\n Visual feedback\r\n Shield shows a different visual representation for EACH level of \"health\" (2 marks) \r\nOR \r\nShield displays in text how much health it has remaining (2 marks).\r\n\r\n<strong>Level 5 \u2013 Moving Bouncy Barriers</strong>\n<strong>3%</strong>\r\n   2\r\n Moving bouncy barriers\r\n Moving barriers follow a predetermined path (1 mark) and cause projectiles to bounce of them appropriately (1 mark).\r\n   1\r\n Correctly resetting\r\n Barriers only reset when level is reloaded, not after each shot (1 mark).\u00a0\r\n\r\n<strong>Level 6 \u2013 Cluster Bomb</strong>\n<strong>6%</strong>\r\n   2\r\n Functionality\r\n When projectile hits the terrain (or the  enemy), it explodes as normal (1 mark), but releases five extra  projectiles in random directions and velocities (1 mark).\r\n   2\r\n Spawning Action\r\n Extra projectiles always move generally away  from the surface that the main projectile hit (2 mark).\u00a0 For example, if  hitting a horizontal surface while moving downwards, they all go  somewhat upwards, if hitting a vertical surface while moving left, they  all go somewhat right.\u00a0\r\nMore technically: spawned projectiles are  created with velocities whose angles are no more than 90 degrees away  from the contact normal.\r\n   2\r\n Extra projectile functionality\r\n Each extra projectile functions just like a  smaller version of the main projectile both visually (1 mark) and in  functionality, i.e. smaller projectile and smaller explosion radius and  damage (1 mark).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T19:00:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8ba95a9a63d720568ef701efbf81389a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["D00by"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
