I'm James, the creator of Voxelvoid.<br/></p><p>Voxelvoid is a retro-styled fast-paced survival shooter.</p><p>It is the result of three personal goals I created at the start of last year:</p><ol><li>Release a game by the end of 2014.</li><li>Create a game that I personally want to play.</li><li>Build a game based on my new voxel based game engine.</li></ol><p>This game (and the underlying engine) is something I've beein developing in my spare time throughout the year. As the December deadline approached, it became clear that in order to achieve my second goal, I would need to compromise on the first. I'm glad I did. The first version of Voxelvoid is fun and includes depth of mastery and gameplay that evolves as the player progresses.</p><p>Voxelvoid v1.0 will be released for iPhone and iPad within a few weeks. In the mean time, you can follow me on Twitter for updates: @jmhobrien</p><p>I hope you enjoy Voxelvoid as much as I do, and I would appreciate any feedback/suggestions.  </p><p>James.</p><p>The official Website for Voxelvoid: http://www.voxelvoid.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/642/642c41c0ef9f1108359a3e9b1531caaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vvoid"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
