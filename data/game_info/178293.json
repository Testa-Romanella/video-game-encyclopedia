You have to keep a good public image in front of the cameras. You have to follow the protocole, have a good gesture, be well-dressed. People don't give a fuck aboute your political ideas, they just want a good looking in their T.V. It's the same for the journalist who will comments your action, talkin' about dumb things which we don't give a fuck.<br/>The game style is a realistic pixel art styling, inspired by real pictures of the investiture of francois. It deal with the materiality of the screens which remains that what we've seen on screen is always a representation of a crypted reality, it's not real, it's the game of the communication, not the information.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99b0ace1215dd239c105bb4e66a93380.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mr.Costard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
