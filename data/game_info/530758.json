Not to be taken seriously, ofcourse, but honestly, have you seen a bird baby lately?</p><p>---</p><p>In the game you play Bob, a recent government drone (pigeon) who decided to do whatever he pleases. He now just exclusively eats fries and shits on cars. Use X to propel yourself up by shitting, making sure to hit the cars below!
