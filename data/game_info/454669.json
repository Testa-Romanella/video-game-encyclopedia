So I decided to build one!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I called it \"Spork\", and you can download it here. However, I wouldn't be able to develop it in a vaccuum, I would have to see how well it worked in a real game, which features it lacked, etc, so I also developed this game just to test it. It should also serve ass an example how to use Spork, so it's open source, and you can get it from my github.</p><p>Oh, and obviously everything is still WIP. Including Spork itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T02:38:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d50/d5085e1f6ad9f7467679ff0f6a82e3e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kurt_c0caine"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
