Gaining their strengths/abilities or ability to open matching dungeon entrances.\u00a0 </li><li>If an enemy of the same \"TRAIT\" (Ability) attacks you will die, if you  consume a trait before you die, your health is restored and you take  over that body.</li></ul>\n<p>Github:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/SHEePYTaGGeRNeP/GameDevTVGameJam</p>\n<p>Tooling used:</p>\n<ul><li>https://pixilart.com </li><li>Blender 3</li><li>TexturePacker (Free)</li><li>Unity 2022<ul><li>Assets; URP and (maybe) Utils</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T18:08:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a70/a70193c5e141f312f310e0c62fb251cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PSPiso", "SHEePYTaGGeRNeP"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
