Try to survive the fight, and score as many goals as you can. I strongly recommend full screen mode. Also, it's hard so prepare to die :)<br/>Apart from sounds, everything in this game is made by me.<br/>Music - Content Sensitive -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDG8nIxK71A<br/>Sound Effects- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/free-casual-game-sfx-pack-5...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/347db06564b9da0f58ec0d02c55290af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Miko122"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
