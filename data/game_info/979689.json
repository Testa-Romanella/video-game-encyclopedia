Keep reading for more info about the game's features and content!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bent Oak Island was once a bustling tourist hot spot, until a fire burned through the town square and turned everything to cinders. With the destruction of the town center, tourism dried up, and with it the main source of income for the island. Now 15 years later, the island has moved on, but is a shell of it's former self. The future of the island seems bleak, and to make matters worse, an air of dread has settled on the islanders. Ned at the diner is barely able to make ends meet after the paper factory shut its doors. The Captain swears the fish he catches are talking about him behind his back. A strange, hairy creature has been sighted stalking through the forests of the nature preserve. And Ted from the University on the mainland has measured the beginnings of disturbing tectonic activity-  vibrations in the ground. The same activity that happened 15 years ago on the night of the fire.<br/><br/>Will Archer and Sam unravel the secrets of Bent Oak Island in time to save themselves from certain doom?
