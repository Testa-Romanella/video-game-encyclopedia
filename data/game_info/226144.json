Play as either Rosie or Max as you swish through the grass, splash through the river and squelch through the mud on the children\u2019s exciting search of a bear. You can\u2019t go over it, you can\u2019t go under it so you\u2019ll have to go through the big dark on your hunt, but what will you find inside the narrow gloomy cave?<br/><br/>Search through the grass to find lots of creepy crawlies and explore the rockpools to discover the underwater creatures! Our bear is cute and playful. Wash him, dress him up and even help shoo away the bees before he chases after you on your way home.<br/><br/><br/>\u201cI love this Bear Hunt app. It\u2019s a bit difficult for me so I\u2019m hoping to find some children to show me how to play it so that I don\u2019t get lost in the forest and never get out.
