Falling fruits occupy the next available space within the column.<br/><br/><br/>Link/connect four fruits of the same type and color next to each other either vertically or horizontally. You have the option to flip the fruits by 90 degree units and you can also move them down quickly, with the aim off creating a horizontal or vertical line of four similar fruits without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. As the score increases, the fruits fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of fruits reaches the top of the playing field and no new sequence of fruits are able to enter.<br/><br/><br/> Features include :-<br/><br/>1) Simple UI <br/>2) Addictive gameplay <br/>3) Cool music and sound effects <br/>4) View your current and high score anytime <br/>5) Nice animation <br/>6) No IAP, universal game and awesome gameplay!<br/><br/>Try it yourself!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed2/ed2767db5e6d63b80b840807f9a98516_eXJ6ufF.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Aditya Mohata"], "genres": ["Sports", "Family"], "publishers": ["Aditya Mohata"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
