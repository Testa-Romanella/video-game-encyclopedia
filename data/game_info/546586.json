Your toddler of course :) Sing along as you play Peekaboo in the stables, count eggs from the hens, splash in muddy puddles with the pigs, feed the ducks and drive the farm truck! Phew. After a hard day's work around the farm yard, it's time for bed.  Wait... what's that?! Is it a cow jumping over the moon? A farmer's work is never done, not even at bedtime :)<br/><br/>Children love being the farmer &amp; role-playing in this classic nursery rhyme. There's so much interactive fun to have with all the animals. Singing, memorizing rhymes and imaginative role-play are all early learning milestones, so your toddler develops Preschool skills as they play. Research shows that a familiarity with rhymes helps children progress with reading, and have a lot of fun at the same time.<br/><br/>Extra educational games include jigsaw puzzles and memory games. These puzzle games are especially designed for preschoolers and have 3 levels to progress through.<br/><br/>You can pop on your farmer's hat straightaway in this free version. Sing-along to 2 of the verses - the ducks quacking and the dog barking - both starring your child as Old MacDonald. Feed the ducks, make fish leap, soar high on the farm swing and bang the drum in time to the music. There are also memory games and farm puzzles to try out. Unlock all 8 verses, all jigsaw puzzles and memory games with a single in-app purchase which is behind a parent lock. Once unlocked with the single purchase, there are no further in-app purchases.<br/><br/>Fun features - and sshhh, educational too :)<br/>\u2022 Be a farmer for a day - imaginative role-play for girls and boys<br/>\u2022 Sing along to a favorite nursery rhyme<br/>\u2022 Starring photo faces of family &amp; friends - great for face recognition (&amp; giggles!)<br/>\u2022 Learn animal names and sounds<br/>\u2022 Develop fine motor skills with jigsaw puzzles (3 levels to progress through)<br/>\u2022 Improve memory skills and concentration with memory match games<br/>\u2022 Learn about rhythm and music<br/>\u2022 Get creative - make characters using your photos, just add hats &amp; hair!<br/><br/>This is a safe app carefully designed for toddlers and preschoolers (age 2-5), with no third-party advertising.<br/><br/>OkiPlay is a family games studio, devoted to learning and play.
