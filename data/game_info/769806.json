The sun and stars have died long ago and our present day is not even a memory. What remains of humanity survives in massive arcologies called Redoubts on a dark, cold Earth full of things that go bump in the night. But you usually don't enter the night lands if you don't have a reason. And then the power station of your Redoubt is failing.</p>\n<p> This is an old-school keyboard-driven dungeon crawler very loosely inspired by William Hope Hodgson's masterpiece. You go out there, map a dungeon full of things that would have made your life complicated in games of yore, like spinners, teleporters and others. Select three of four predefined characters, fight battles with the monsters of the Night Land, level up, survive by finding the rare save spots that save your progress and replenish your health and try to find out what happened in the power station.</p>\n<p>The game was made in one week for the Dungeon Crawler Jam 2022 and should take about a couple of hours to complete.<br/></p>\n<p> Good luck, you will need it.</p>\n<p>Credits :<br/>Art : <br/>- Monsters by Tyler Warren : https://tylerjwarren.itch.io/tyler-warren-rpg-battlers-5th-50-monsters-50-shades...<br/>- Portraits and action icons by Delapouite and Lorc : <br/>https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/invisible-face.html<br/>https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/doctor-face.html<br/>- Textures by Jestan : https://jestan.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Music : <br/>- silence_01, silence-02, amb_02, silence_03, amb_03 by knittel : https://opengameart.org/content/horror-soundtrack-8-tracks-the-hangar<br/>- Disturbed Soundscape by Eric Matyas : https://opengameart.org/content/disturbed-soundscape<br/>- Ancient_Apparitions by marcelofg55 : https://opengameart.org/content/ancient-apparitions<br/>- Caught Red Handed by joeBaxterWebb : https://opengameart.org/content/caught-red-handed<br/>- CrEEP by TokyoGeisha : https://opengameart.org/content/creepy<br/>- EmptyCity by yd : https://opengameart.org/content/emptycity-background-music<br/>- horror_loop and narrow_corridors_short by TinyWorlds : https://opengameart.org/content/horror-loop<br/>- Dark Ambience Loop by Iwan Gabovitch : https://opengameart.org/content/dark-ambience-loop<br/>- Abandoned by Jesus Lastra : https://opengameart.org/content/collaboration-theme-song-abandoned<br/>- dungeon_ambient_1 by JaggedStone : https://opengameart.org/content/loopable-dungeon-ambience<br/>- Mystery Manor and Scary Ambient Wind by Alexandr Zhelanov : https://opengameart.org/content/mystery-manor<br/>- Post-Apocalyptic-Wastelands by Juhani Junkala : https://opengameart.org/content/horror-atmosphere</p>\n<p>Sound effects : <br/>- Little Robot Sound Factory : https://opengameart.org/users/little-robot-sound-factory<br/>- Ogrebane : https://opengameart.org/content/monster-sound-effects-pack<br/>- remaxim : https://opengameart.org/content/short-wind-sound<br/>- OwlishMedia : https://opengameart.org/content/sound-effects-pack<br/>- CGEffex : https://opengameart.org/content/punch-slap-n-kick<br/>- Kenney : https://opengameart.org/content/voiceover-pack-fighter-40-taunts<br/>- dorkster : https://opengameart.org/content/stone-stair-steps</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T07:54:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b767ff59a843f1e033be2af22aa0ffa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CryptRat", "Scotoma"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
