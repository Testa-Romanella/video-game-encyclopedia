I'm in need of your assistance.</strong><br/><br/><strong>We know enemy scouts have managed to infiltrate our camp, they have stolen essential information which could compromise everything we've worked for. I need you to infiltrate their camp and tamper with the documents. Destroy the originals and get rid of the scouts, they might know too much. We'll show those disgusting creatures. Unfortunately I cannot join you, but I have faith in you, I know you'll succeed.</strong><br/><strong>I don't think you'll have much troubles dealing with those creatures. If you can, kill as many of them as possible. We want to live in peace and safety.</strong><br/><br/><strong>I wish I had something better to reward you with, but what I have ain't too bad either. I'm looking forward to your return, hero. Good luck</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T05:43:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/439/4397136b64b2836e9ec2e17387084fd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Scruf06"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
