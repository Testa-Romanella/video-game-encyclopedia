Everything repeats. Send help</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Hi there! I am Tyler, or more commonly known as xXSlashhandXx online. I recently bought a cabin, and I\u00a0am willing to spend my money to furnish it up in order for you! the user to buy. Or, not buy exactly, Because you can stay a while for free! I would like it if you donated to us to help with the renovation procedure, but its entirely optional! So if you want a fun camping experience with a lake, hiking trail, caves, and abandoned homes for you to explore</p>\n\n<p>We are not responsible if you die by starvation, dehydration, infectious bite, being taken to hell, nuclear explosion, being taken to a secret realm, being torn apart brutally by tendrils protruding from a humanoid figure, and freezing to death.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is\u00a0 a demon version of the game, \"The Cabin\". This demo includes infinite nights (because they don't mean anything) and one Monster Den, (More specifically, Icare's Ice Den)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:34:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af6/af6bddafd99d2cc1f2349489efa3ffe1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supersoto5"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
