I'm rather pleased with the end result though as (I\u00a0think) a unique one-of-a-kind game on the Spectrum. Indeed, it\u00a0doesn't even seem like a Spectrum game, more a launch title from a\u00a0mythical ZX82 machine which kept the character display of the ZX81 but\u00a0added colour and sound to it.</p>\n<p>The game did take nine months to code though - the development process\u00a0being drawn out somewhat by there being little in the way of tools to\u00a0aid in the creation of the colour ASCII levels and objects (they all\u00a0had to be hand coded into the game) and the fact that it's actually\u00a0quite difficult to produce good meaningful ASCII art within such a\u00a0small space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MicroMart</strong> - <strong>Game of the Week</strong> - \"<em>LumASCII\u00a0is almost a shoot-'em-up in its own genre...
