The game has been updated through Itch's early access system, so anyone following the project could get new content automatically if they used\u00a0the Itch app.</p><p>The road is now complete, and includes 365 levels.</p>\n<ul><li>Details on the game concept can be found here.</li><li>Daily pictures can be seen on the game's blog.</li><li>The Twitter hashtag is #aRoadToAwe.</li><li>The author is of course on Twitter.</li><li>Also on Tumblr and Pinterest.</li></ul>\n<p>Mouse controls</p>\n<ul><li>Left click to move automatically where the pointer is.</li><li>Keep the left mouse button down to move continuously in the direction you're looking at.</li><li>Keep the right mouse button down to look around.</li><li>Keep both buttons down to move and turn at the same time.</li></ul>\n<p>Keyboard controls</p>\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrow keys to move.</li><li>Escape to pause/resume the game or quit.</li></ul>\n<p>Gamepad control (Xbox controller)</p>\n<ul><li>Left pad to move.</li><li>Right pad to look around.</li><li>Trigger buttons to strafe.</li></ul>\n<p>The road has come to an end, but the journey continues.
