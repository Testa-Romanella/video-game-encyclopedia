I have been playing video games for years and I have always dreamed o creating my own. Fushoku is intended to be a full\u00a0 release JRPG Horror game sometime in the future, but for now it is just in its testing phase so that I can get second opinions on the content within it.</p>\n<p>(As of Update v0.1) You are simply a girl named Okashi in her apartment. Currently the game does not sport any plot or levels. It is simply a home with some gimmicks to play with until the next update.</p>\n<p>If you would like to support me in my creation of\u00a0<strong>Fushoku: &gt;help</strong>, a donation is linked at the download page. Donating is never a requirement, but always appreciated. The game in its current state is 100% free.</p>\n<p>Credits to the game are on the official Discord server.\u00a0https://discord.gg/fKU9A6k</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbb/dbbd03b7b0300d3d87c79e97f0dfd80d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kota"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
