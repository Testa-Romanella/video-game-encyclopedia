In Super Pole Riders, a player is supposed to keep the ball on the end of a zip line by operating a pole \u2013 the ball can be either pushed along or kicked. Hokra is a minimalist competition between two teams which objective is to possess the ball for the maximum of time and to keep it in the team\u2019s territory. Johann Sebastian Joust (or simply J. S. Joust) is an individual game in which player attempts to interfere other players\u2019 controller manipulations by increasing the speed of background music playing.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The whole game is simulating a retro-fashioned aesthetics. It is a multi-feature competition which can be focused not only on graphics but also on audio and provides various forms of participation to 2-4 players.
