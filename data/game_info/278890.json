You have only one meaning for your life and that\u00a0is to get presents for\u00a0delivery on Christmas. There are some other problems that comes with it, though.</p>\n<p>All you need is a mouse (and working left and right buttons).\u00a0There's also a tutorial (image) in game that explains what the buttons do and other important features of the game.</p>\n<p>The results of a game jam called \"Extra Credits Holiday 2018\". This was made\u00a0by me alone and I\u00a0used a game engine Unity with C#. I used one asset which is event manager I've made for other games of mine. Other assets are images for landscapes.</p>\n<p>There was four days time to submit a game due to rules of jam.</p>\n<p>Have fun and comments are always welcomed!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/868/868990f76fb5d70fe8920c3d6fdf2d37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Julleh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
