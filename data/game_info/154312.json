To start launch our game releases on itch we would like to give you one of our really earlier releases. LOD (Legend of devon) Was a game me and my friend chris made when we first made our company back in late 2012. We made this to help support injured animals :D anyway the website stated in the credits is our old one and our current one is this\u00a0http://quantics.yolasite.com/games-and-products.php we will be changing soon. Just\u00a0don't\u00a0pay attention to the credits and enjoy. The game is really short but contains the tools to mod and further the story to all owners of rpgmaker vx ace! So for 50p you get the game and the modding tools a bargin. Enjoy fellas and fellases</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5ef77dfbe8d31bf775f300d64a380571.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Quantic games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
