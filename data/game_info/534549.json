In an attempt to escape he fled into an ancient dungeon. Now he is faced with the puzzles, traps and monsters ahead of him and the angry knights on his back. He will have to use whatever he can get to make it through the dungeon faster than the knights that are chasing him.</p>\n<p>This game was made during the Secret Santa Jam 2020. Requested was a puzzle/adventure game with a shooting mechanic. I took my primary inspiration from the original Legend of Zelda game, and tried to put more focus on the shooting mechanics. Instead of one open world I made a set of 8 distinct levels, each with unique puzzles to solve.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>\n<strong>Keyboard &amp; Mouse</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move: WASD, Arrow Keys</li><li>Aim: Mouse</li><li>Shoot: Left Mouse</li><li>Interact: Right Mouse</li><li>Change Item: Mouse Wheel</li><li>Restart Level: R</li><li>Quit to Menu: Q</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controller</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move: Left Stick</li><li>Aim: Right Stick</li><li>Shoot: Right Shoulder</li><li>Interact: Left Shoulder</li><li>Change Item: Triggers</li><li>Restart Level: D-Pad up</li><li>Quit to Menu: D-Pad down</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T04:06:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df1/df1cdb9c9f58334b25ae6c2db9d59105.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chandrion"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
