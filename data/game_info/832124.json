A ghost story that seems to be coming true. As more and more victims continue to disappear, it's up to you to find out what has happened to them. Will you make it out alive with the evidence you need? Or will your name be added to the list of the missing?</p>\n<p>Weeping Woods is\u00a0a Third-Person atmospheric horror-adventure game where players are tasked with exploring an abandoned town haunted by an evil entity. To survive, players must search through the abandoned buildings\u00a0for evidence of the missing people that they were sent to find, all while avoiding the creature that now haunts\u00a0them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weeping Woods\u00a0utilizes a dynamic searching/looting mechanic that allows players to interact with objects in the\u00a0environment, An AI enemy that actively pursues the player, dynamic set pieces,\u00a0\u00a0a dynamic lighting system for player navigation, as well as\u00a0randomized item locations to help ensure each playthrough is unique.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>(Note from the developer):</p>\n<p>Hi! My name is\u00a0Joe, I'm a solo developer and the creator of Weeping Woods. I\u00a0have decided to offer this game for free so that anybody who wants to try the game\u00a0can. However, if you enjoy the game at all, please consider donating, even if it's just $1. All of the games that I make\u00a0are completely self-funded and done in\u00a0my free time, but these costs add up, and donations are what allow me to continue making games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My last 2 games were also available for free, and out of more than 1,500+ downloads, I only received 4 donations.\u00a0 It's not that I'm not grateful for everyone who played (I am!) It's just not sustainable over the long run. So, if you enjoy the game, please consider donating. It's less than a cup of coffee and keeps the lights on. Thank you for playing!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>PS: If you decide to play the game for your YouTube channel, please leave a link to your videos\u00a0below! I love to watch the playthroughs as they help\u00a0me improve as a game developer by seeing how people play the game, as well as\u00a0troubleshooting any potential bugs. Cheers!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T08:18:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f91/f91697067b3dc5e873417c98919410f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Decoy Software"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
