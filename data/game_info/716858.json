Exploratory laparoscopy of SCP-847 shows the presence of internal structures resembling an incomplete set of bones, organs, and major blood vessels, composed of the same polymer. Small amounts of a black, volatile resin similar to plastination compounds leak from the eyes and damage regions of the mannequin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*The game contains scary scenes/jumpscares that may seem disturbing to some players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T08:17:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dd/4dd204ca99c4d43bcd8292db0ce43f00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M-RX"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
