{"id": 899261, "slug": "hodag", "name": "HODAG", "name_original": "HODAG", "description": "In the middle of the frigid Wisconsin wilderness, something horrid stirs. Can you repair your vehicle and escape with your life?\r\n\n<p>HODAG, named after the creature from Wisconsin\u00a0folklore, is a first person \"horror-ish\" low poly\u00a0exploration game, in which you are tasked with finding 3 items to repair your broken down truck. Your revolver only has 6 rounds, so you'll have to make each shot count as you explore the icy Wisconsin wilderness, and the abandoned warehouse located within. Find all 3 items and return to your truck to survive... find a hidden fourth item to get the true ending!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Movement - WASD, Mouse</p>\n<p>Shoot - Left Click</p>\n<p>Aim - Right Click (Hold)</p>\n<p>Interact - E Key</p>\n<p>Jump - Space Key</p>\n<p>Pause - Escape Key</p><p>Quit - Alt + F4, or the in-game \"Quit\" option of the pause menu</p>\n\r\n** Though this game is designed to be played with mouse and keyboard, a controller layout has been implemented. Please note that the pause menu has not been made fully compatible with controller, and the \"Start\" button may need to be pushed to begin playing the game, after the stage loads**\r\nMovement - Analogue Sticks\r\nShoot - R1/RB\r\nAim - L1/LB\r\nInteract -\u00a0Square/X\r\nJump - X/A\r\nPause - Start\r\n\r\n\r\nTips\r\n<p>All of the collectable items have a red glow, and they do not change position. Once you know where each item is, they will be there every time you play!</p>\n<p>You only have 6 shots. Make sure to count your shots well, as there is no on-screen counter.</p>\n<p>Windows can also be broken by shooting them, which may give you some interesting pathing opportunities, or allow you to get to a vantage point.</p>\n<p>To get the true ending, a hidden fourth collectable must be found, too. It is tucked away in a high up place.</p>\n\r\nDeveloper Note\r\n<p>Thank you for playing HODAG, my very first game! This game took about 5 months to make, as I\u00a0worked on it in my spare time. All aspects of the game were made by me from scratch, except for the gunshot sound, the glass breaking sound, and the logo. Proper attribution is included below, as well as in the credits of the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please understand that when I started this project, I didn't know much about making games and my programming knowledge was (and still is) still in its infancy. As a result, you may experience a number of bugs and/or \"jankiness\". Thank you for your understanding, and thank you for checking out HODAG!\r\n</p>\n\r\nAttribution\r\n<p>S: Layered Gunshot 5.wav by Xenonn -- https://freesound.org/s/128299/ -- License: Creative Commons 0</p>\n<p>S: 001.wav by gevaroy -- https://freesound.org/s/173560 -- License: Creative Commons 0</p>\n<p>\"HODAG\" title screen logo by Breanna Dalke</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T12:34:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/860/860482c3e474ae4e2cf1955d8548abd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LoganMakesGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
