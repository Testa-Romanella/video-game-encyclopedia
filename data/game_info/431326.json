I had been programming for few years already but still was stuck with Visual Basic (well at least not QBasic anymore). My friend was also just getting into programming and together we hacked up this very simple game in few hours and most likely spent way more hours playing it and competing for high scores. The game was very crude but somehow weirdly fun and addictive. It came to my mind and I wanted to try to see if I could capture that magic again. The game ended up not being very close the the original mechanically but the same essence is still there.</p>\n<p><strong>Flock for Feast</strong> is an arcade style single screen score-attack game where you just try to stay alive as long as possible and rack up major points. You're in control of a flock of birds that are preyed upon by a vicious monster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:49:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b876f83593447aa072eed98daf58649e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["anttihaavikko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
