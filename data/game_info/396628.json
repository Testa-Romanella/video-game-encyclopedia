It was made with the Unity game engine.\u00a0I was the lead programmer in addition to\u00a0handling the majority\u00a0of the project inside Unity.</p>\n<p><strong>Description of the game</strong>:</p>\n<p>It is a top down perspective endless \"runner\"\u00a0for Android. A train moves forward on a set of three railroad track lanes. The player must change the tracks in front of the train in order to switch between the three lanes so the train doesn't crash into obstacles. The player can also fix broken tracks by replacing them with good ones. The train speeds up over time to increase the difficulty. If the train crashes, it's game over.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works</strong>:</p>\n<p>There are a total of 11 different track variations. In each variation there are three columns and eight rows of track. A random track variation from the 11 variations is chosen to be spawned in next.\u00a0Any track on the grid\u00a0can be changed by tapping the track UI\u00a0buttons at the bottom of the screen to select track type (Left, Straight, Right) then tapping any track on the grid. Changing a track will not remove obstacles. The player can fix a broken track by changing it to a good one though!</p>\n<p><strong>Things I did for this project</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Created script to handle train movement and the train crashing into obstacles\u00a0(moving forward, switching lanes, speed up over time).</li><li>Created script to handle player input and control changing the tracks.\u00a0</li><li>Created script to keep score and display it on screen.</li><li>Created script to randomize the track sets being spawned in.</li><li>Created script to despawn track sets\u00a0once they are passed and out of view.</li><li>Created script to control the day/night cycle, it smoothly moves an object between two Post Processing Volumes that have different Post Processing Profiles.</li><li>Created script that triggers a tutorial on the first run after install.</li><li>Created script to force the player to change the requested track to what\u00a0the tutorial asks for and no other tracks.</li><li>Set up Prefabs in the project in order\u00a0for the team to implement assets easier.</li><li>Optimized game by remaking the track and ground models in low poly form. Also by switching the project to the Lightweight Render Pipeline.</li><li>Created animator and animations for the\u00a0bird and tumbleweed.</li><li>Helped implement menus and settings by fixing bugs / errors.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Link to Unity Project on GitHub:</strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/nathanAjacobs/RailroadSurgeon<br/></p>\n<p><strong>GIFs</strong>:<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:19:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cee/ceed0c6cf2471829b1bb48f028d02e76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Nathan Jacobs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
