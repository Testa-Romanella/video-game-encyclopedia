Luckily you are not like most adventurers\u2026</p>\n<p>You have been taken here upon your request and have been dropped off on the coast to make your way along any paths you will find further inland. Armed with your lantern, quarter staff and your courage, your goal is the find the key stone obelisks that are being kept hidden by a mysterious jungle, a great pool of volcanic rock and a passage that leads to the sky. Find these treasures, bring them back to the central obelisk of light and you will bring the light back from the grasp of the ghosts that have guarded them for so long!\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Watch out for misleading paths and dangerous obstacles!\r\n  </strong></li><li><strong>Jump from platform to platform as you time your movements carefully!\r\n  </strong></li><li><strong>Fight off the evil spirits and absorb all the light you can into your lantern!\r\n  </strong></li><li><strong>And remember where you came from as you make your way back to follow another route!</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Navigate your way along the three paths and reach the obelisks to take the light back from them by holding your lantern close to them.
