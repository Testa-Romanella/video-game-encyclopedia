A shifting, chaotic world that takes its form from the memories, culture or beliefs of the souls who pass through. When a dead man awakens with only the memory of a figure in black, he sets into motion a chain of events that have truly mythic consequences.<br/><br/>Step into the boots of the dead man William Mason (voiced by Ron Perlman) and descend into the grim and gritty world of Purgatory in this fast-paced cover shooter which combines the fluidity of twin-stick controls and tactical cover usage. Put your skills to the test - Dodge behind cover as you try to outgun your enemies in the unknown procedurally generated hunting grounds. The Wild West has never been this dark.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-20T04:55:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c19/c1969d33f9992b1c8b3720ac8f76b6a6.jpg", "website": "https://westofdead.com/", "rating": 3.18, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 174, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 499, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Upstream Arcade"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Raw Fury"], "esrb_rating": null}
