Use gravity as your weapon as you launch crates at each other and collect powerups to increase your stance in the fight!</p><p>This game was made during Ludum Dare 30! The theme was \"Connected Worlds\" and I thought it was a good idea to make a game about two literally connected enemy worlds. I also wanted to incorporate multiplayer into it so I made it a sort of brawler! Hope you enjoy!</p><p>Music by Harrs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4e323a4ac5bd60d9195fd05a33a4891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yukon W."], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
