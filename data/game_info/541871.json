Players are waiting in line for the latest game console, the Gamestation 6, but they must wait in line. With the line ever creeping forward, players must perform tasks or get kicked out, such as holding stacks of boxes, holding onto someone's dogs, and more. With an estimated playtime of 10 minutes, can you get the Gamestation, or will you die trying?</p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Gavin Chambers: Lead Design</p>\n<p>Josh Libby: Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Kevin Ingalls: Programmer</p>\n<p>Logan Cropper: Lead Sound Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:57:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c34/c34f037d4c873e52a29936b54dd5644e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gavinastrics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
