All you need is to follow a weird spirit from your amulet. You have to handle a connection with it: when it gets close to you, press right mouse button to keep connection. Otherwise it breaks and you lose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For some reason you also have a gun instead of your left hand. To use it press left mouse button. It will help you in elimination of unknown mechanisms. Their only purpose is to break your connection.</p>\n\n<p>Made by:</p>\n<p>TET (Mikhail) \u2014 art, sound, models, animations</p>\n<p>baldron (Andrey) \u2014 code, animations</p><p>Sources:<br/></p>\n<p>font \u2014 modeseven by Andrew Bulhak</p><p>Engine \u2014 Godot<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:21:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a08/a0812bc9b7c0dc4e9afd748a91b95ec0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baldron"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
