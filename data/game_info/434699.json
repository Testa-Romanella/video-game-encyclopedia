As to keep it alive, this beast needs to appear in front of people and to become more popular.</p>\n<p>BigBoot and Niessy weren't able to join the game due to the required extra efforts. Nevertheless, in case it's requested by people, there will be a new version after GameJam including them. Besides some game improvements that couldn't be implemented on time.</p>\n<p>People will change into green color and spread the Jetty's knowledge to the people that is far away.</p>\n<p>Don't let the popularity drops under 10% or the game will end. Keep going for 80 years or reach 90% of popularity.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game, sorry for the English mistakes, thanks for playing and for your comments!</p>\n<p>Don't forget to enable the sound, switched OFF by default.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- Mouse: Left click - Show beast<br/>- Move mouse to move beast horizontally</p>\n<p>Implemented by:<br/>Luis Miguel Rubio - @SiulerLM</p>\n<p>Developed on: Game Maker Studio 2</p>\n<p>Graphics done with:<br/>- Procreate<br/>- Pixel Studio<br/>- Photofiltre</p>\n<p>Music created on:<br/>- BeepBox</p>\n<p>Sound created on:<br/>- Audacity</p>\n<p>No beast was damaged during this game implementation, but the human that implemented it.</p>\n<p>Dealgo Dev.
