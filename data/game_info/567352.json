The Guerrilla player can only place their pieces of intersection of the checkers squares\u00a0and tries to capture COIN pieces by surrounding them (in a Go-like way).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong>keyboard arrows +\u00a0X\u00a0key or mouse / touch</p>\n<p>COIN makes one move per turn, or captures by jumping over Guerrilla pieces diagonally.\u00a0They are\u00a0not forced to capture, but when they start they have to keep capturing until it is no longer possible. Guerrilla places two pieces each turn, the first one adjacent to their existing pieces, the 2nd piece adjacent to the first.</p>\n<p>A game of Guerrilla Checkers ends when one side eliminates all other pieces, or when the Guerrilla runs out of pieces to place (their loss). If the Guerilla paints themself into a corner (stalemate), the game ends in a draw.</p>\n<p>This game is an adaptation of the original board-game by Brian Train using the NICO game framework by @impbox.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T09:14:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81b/81bd7fa826c57103740998735afa3c35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mischa_u"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
