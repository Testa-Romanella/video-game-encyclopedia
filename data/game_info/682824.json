The game's storyline, set in the modern world, follows Indiana Jones as he continues to recover from his injuries and recover from being a hero to the people of Scotland.<br/>\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfEgx6ljWO#t=1m40s\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqGvTQ6ZhIf#t=2m53s\n\nThis game is set in a modern, open world. From the look of it, this will be a game for PC players, not consoles because we don't have a great amount of console support for a while.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksxqkVJE9oI#t=3m49s\n\nThe game is set to follow in the field of archaeology, where he has to retrieve artifacts from an underground mine.\n\nOver the years, the game has been described as a \"Classical Open World RPG\". It has been out for quite some time, but it's only with this video that we've been able to get our hands on it. A huge thanks goes to Outhouse Media for successively bringing out more and more of their games and offering us a chance to try them out, here's hoping we've found a lot more treasures this time!\n\nWho wants to try the game out now</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:03:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ab/6ab9e363a4103f086053aa0c501b5a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
