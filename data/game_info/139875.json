The field responds to your movements - it oscillates and ripples in response to your motions. The more the field is agitated, the faster the score racks up - and the faster the red particles are spawned. And beware: the shape of the field itself distorts the path of the particles. Use it well, and it can be a weapon - miscalculate, and it could lead to an early\u00a0annihilation...</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move the particle with your mouse</p>\n<p>ESC to quit</p>\n<p>Click to restart after losing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5fe442940adbf64350eb6fac3e1d1e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gan_HOPE326"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
