Can you set it up to feel responsive but still look nice?</p><p><strong>WASD </strong>to move/attack</p><p>Intended to help designers and developers explore these questions:</p><ul><li>Should player input skip to the end of animations instantly so the game is responsive?  Or should the player wait for animations so movement looks smooth and events are clear?</li><li>Should enemies move all together at once and obscure the order of events?  Or should they move one at a time and create a slower, less snappy experience?</li><li>Should the enemies wait for the player to finish movement animations before starting their turn?  Or act the instant you input your move?</li><li>What animation speed feels best?</li><li>How do projectiles look and feel? (Wizard)</li><li>How do enemy multi-move turns feel? (Bat)</li><li>How do things feel with few or many enemies on screen?</li></ul><p>Try different combinations of settings to see what you think.</p><p>When you are exploring, don't only play slowly, make sure to test the limits by playing faster than the animations can draw!  Hammer the game as fast as you can with a quick series of steps, and make sure to try some 3-button rolls. Does it drop inputs?  Is that okay?</p><p>Really getting to feel the tradeoffs helped me to understand what works and what doesn't.</p><p>What approach do you think looks and feels the best?
