The theme this time was \"One Room\".<br/><br/><br/>My goal was to try to make something original, so I tried getting creative with the theme. That's where the feng shui idea came from, and after I had that it became obvious to me that the game should be done in VR. <br/><br/>It plays like a turn-based combat game (think: Pokemon and other JRPGs), where your attack damage/traits/abilities are determined by the arrangement of furniture in your room. It's kind of like chess, if you want to stretch that definition :P<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, a magical rock infused with \"bagua\" powers is launched at your opponent, simultaneously reducing their health and sending debris into their room, causing their furniture arrangement to potentially get messed up. <br/><br/><br/>I didn't at all plan for this to become a real game, as I thought I'd be happy enough to come up with the goofy idea alone. Now though, I've actually planned out quite a bit of interesting gameplay elements which I didn't have time to fully implement during the competition. Maybe later on I'll finish this project and polish it up to have a real, albeit strange, game.<br/><br/>________________<br/>Music from Jukedeck - create your own at http://jukedeck.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/517/5176a3a76e67080925eb9219451e4c8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bogwog"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
