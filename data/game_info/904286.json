The game is a short, punchy adventure that doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome with about a one hour playtime. Gameplay consists of alternating between quiz rounds and interview sessions where the player character chats with the game\u2019s mysterious host. As the player progresses, they discover the true nature of the game: They are in fact playing the classic game against Death itself and winning is their\u00a0only shot at living again. As the game progresses, the gameplay will also shift with its tone with the player not only trying to\u00a0find factual answers but also answers that will please the host.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T04:25:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9ee051207bb66ce88b31919f8fbd94b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GhostSquared"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
