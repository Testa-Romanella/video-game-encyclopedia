The game was an attempt to put a twist on the <strong>Flappy Bird</strong> genre. The game allows the player to bounce (flap) up and down to make it through the gates (pipes). It also introduced a 3 lane design to it, similar to <strong>Subway Surfer</strong>. The player is tasked with both bouncing and changing to the lane with the open gate.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T13:04:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb9/fb950974b1b9f1877bcb431f78c69622.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Josh Montague"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
