In love/bots/KILL you use your observational skills to spot the monster in the crowd and assassinate it before you're whisked back through time or... it gets to you first. \u00a0Scroll to the bottom of this page for some tips and tricks if you're finding it too difficult!</p>\n<p>This game was created by Ionwhat, Littlekittenbit, and Mayor McFrumples for Kyle Bosman's Robot Party Game Jam 2022. Music by Brian Bonsteel. Sound design by @blepasaur.\u00a0Additional SFX from Freesound.org.\u00a0Modded Simple Dialogue Box code provided by CedSharp.\u00a0Modded Particle Systems provided by GameMaker Casts.\u00a0FutilePro font provided by Eeve Somepx.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD to walk</p>\n<p>LMB to blast, interact, and progress menus and text boxes.</p>\n<p>The aim target icon merely shows where you're pointing. You don't need to hover over the bot to kill it.</p>\n<p>SPACE to pause while in a level.</p>\n<p>ESC to skip dialogue and cutscenes.</p>\n\n<p>Latest build created on June 4th, 2022</p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<p>- one phase of Schippie fight doesn't function properly.\u00a0 Dying and resetting the level fixes it. This error is inconsistent and might be resolved.</p>\n\n\n<p>Here is the latest intel on the known behaviors of the hidden assassin bots:</p>\n<p>- Some are known to dress in particular disguises.</p>\n<p>- Occasionally bots will be known to ritualistically walk in a square pattern. The assassinbot rejects the old ways and walks in a circle.</p>\n<p>- And then sometimes they'll prefer to just walk north to south and back. Watch for that assassinbot going against the grain!</p>\n<p>- Some are speedy!</p>\n<p>- Some are naturally the nervous type.\u00a0Some play it cool.. until your blaster gets too close.</p>\n<p>- Some are working on their cloaking abilities.</p>\n<p>- Some send out a frequency ping that gets more frequent the closer you get to it.</p>\n<p>- Some are big, some are small!</p>\n<p>- Some think that if it mimics your every move you won't catch on.</p>\n<p>- Some have\u00a0developed a taste for coffee.</p>\n<p>- Some are so powerful the bots around them are pushed away or shake uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>- Some have figured out teleportation over short distances.</p>\n<p>- Some skulk around in the dark.</p>\n<p>- Some.. have learned to fight back.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ok ok ok you want the cheats? Here ya go:</p>\n<p>On the start screen press 1-6 to skip to a level. 6 is Schippie's level, and 4/5 are mixed up in that 4 is the last level.</p>\n<p>Pressing R will put an exclamation mark over the assassin's head.</p>\n<p>RETURN will auto kill the assassin, with the exception of the last level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T14:53:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf8/cf8ad73b04e08288e857dee9f30eeafd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MayorMcFrumples", "Ionwhat", "blepasaur", "littlekittenbit"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
