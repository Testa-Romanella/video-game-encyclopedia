I used the Enet library for real-time, reliable communication over UDP and Google's Flatbuffers\u00a0library to generate C# and C++ code used for serializing &amp; deserializing in-game messages sent over the network.\u00a0I compiled a DLL from the Enet source code written in C\u00a0to use it as a native plugin from C# in Unity.\u00a0The physics simulation runs on the server which I implemented from scratch (in C++, without using any 3d party libraries). The source code of this project is not available, but you can download the source code of Space Battle Online which uses the same technology.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:36:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/433/433bb1ef0ce7195096332c9ab7cb50ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["tgreg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
