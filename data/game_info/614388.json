Looking at the level you have to plan a list of commands considering the switching nature of directions.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The game is fully controlled by mouse.</p>\n<p>Press and drag to pan across the level. Press commands buttons to add the according command to the list of commands. You can drag the list as well.</p>\r\nFeedback<p>This prototype exists for one sole purpose: to test the concept and gather feedback.</p><p>I would really appreciate it if you could provide some feedback.
