Your power makes you hungry really fast, so you'll have to seek for food cans to fill your stomach. Be careful! Some cans are not exactly food!<br/></p>\r\nGame Jam\r\n<p>This game is a submission for the\u00a0Dream Arcade Archive Jam. My focus within this game jam was to create an arcade game that integrated an adaptation of modern \"hunger\" survival systems, plus some pop/internet(?) culture that wasn't present in the original arcade times, as is the videos of cats destroying stuff. All of these while trying to keep the arcade feeling alive.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>They're very simple, punch and pick things up with \"Z\", move with arrows or WASD.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Most of the art in the game and the game itself is made by me.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits to other artists:</p>\n<p>- Main Character</p>\n<p>- Background Chiptune (Faster)</p>\n<p>- Sound effects</p>\n\n<p>Right now you can only play on browser. Thanks for playing!\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:15:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bdb45b16dfb1b289390654e7d4251e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GamesThatTasteLikeGarlic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
