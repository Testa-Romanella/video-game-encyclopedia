Instead, I ended up with a low-poly game with the scope stripped all the way down to the prototype it is now. So what happened?</p>\r\nPrototype\r\n\r\n<p>I went with creating a prototype for two reasons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>First, Push The Button would be my first real attempt at making a 3D game. While I have training in Maya, there is so much more to making a 3D game within Unity than my usual 2D games (lighting(!), materials, shaders, the list goes on...). I was not sure if I wanted to dive into full development while learning these new skills.</p>\n<p>Second, I wasn't sure if my idea was even going to be fun to begin with. Experience within development has taught me the pain of spending lots of time producing all the elements that make up a game only for most (see: none) of it being used because the game didn't work out.</p>\r\nThe Result\r\n\r\n<p>In the end I have what I would consider an over-polished prototype. I got too carried away with programming this prototype.\u00a0I spent way too much time coding backend systems that were not needed for the prototype, but they did lay the groundwork to easily expand the game should I decide to make a full length title. I mean who the F*** puts achievements, some which are quite obscure, into a prototype?! lol</p>\n<p>Everything considered, it was a great learning experience all around. Will I pursue the game further beyond a prototype? Who knows. I am going to take a break away from it for the time being and see what inspires me. I did implement analytics into the game (I told you I went overboard on the programming) so it will be fun to see the choices you make in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lastly, I would love to hear what you thought of the prototype either in a comment here, or reach out to me over on Twitter. All constructive feedback is welcome.</p>\n<p>Happy gaming!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T06:32:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/005/005c9af73f680f04f0033c231c99833d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hero Power Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
