The development started in the weekend of Ludum Dare 51, with the theme of \"every 10 seconds\", but unfortunately I didn't have the to finish it before the deadline. Still I wanted to finish it, so here it is!</p>\n<p>Every 10 seconds the prices of the houses change. How much they change depends on how clean they are (negative change) and to which level they are upgraded (positive change). Buy the houses when they are cheap, clean them, upgrade them and sell them with a profit. The goal is to get to $500.000,- in the shortest time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T10:31:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f5682461ff859e94064a8b21795348c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BMK Digital"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
