It was made as part of the Weekly Hour Game Jam. I'm actually quite proud of it.

You won't survive for long, so collect as many coins as you can! Follow the arrow above the player to find them. </p><p>Oh and did I mention you can change plants? Because you can!!! Become one with nature as you disguise yourself to escape the clutches of the evil robots. But beware, some robots might unknowingly patrol right through your hiding spot... </p><p>Hope you like it!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t(plant*)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e3e5f72c469056434b44b2dc2f71f19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fyxe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
