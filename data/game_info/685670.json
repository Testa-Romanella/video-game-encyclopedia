The original plan was the Crownado was just going to be a Crownade that scattered bird seed and a swarm of crows was going to circle around; unfortunately time rand out and it was simplified to the crownado.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD\u00a0</strong>- Move\r\n</li><li><strong>Shift\u00a0</strong>- Sprint\r\n</li><li><strong>Space\u00a0</strong>- Jump\r\n</li><li><strong>E\u00a0</strong>- Pick up gun\r\n</li><li><strong>Right Mouse Button</strong> - Aim gun\r\n</li><li><strong>Left Mouse Button (only when aiming</strong>) - Shoot gun\r\n</li><li><strong>G</strong> - Throw Crownado (in version v2 and later)\r\n</li><li><strong>Mouse Scrolling\u00a0</strong>- Switch weapons (only useful if you find the Super Candy Gun in version v2 and later)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Which version should I play</strong>?<br/></p>\n<p>I personally recommend the latest version if you want to have a much better experience. If you're ranking me for the Game Jam, note these issues in the submission:</p>\n<ul><li>I had no crow reference in my submission</li><li>The game never ended; the end state was added in v2</li><li>It could have been confusing what you were supposed to really do; in v2 we added a \"go here\" indicator to help you get to the end of the game</li><li>Shooting the gun had lots of issues. Sometimes it would animate but nothing was shot. Sometimes it would shoot the candy but go right through the kids. There was no shooting sound effects and the candy was very small, so you really didn't know if it was even firing.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>What was created by the authors:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I leveraged a handful of 3rd party/external assets due to a lack of time (see the below section for details), including the environment assets (including level design, the whole level is ripped as a demo map from one of my assets), music, character animations/movement. So here's an explicit list of the things I actually ended up doing myself:</p>\n<ul><li>The main character modeling and rigging</li><li>The kid character modeling and rigging</li><li>The candy corn model</li><li>The egg and egg splat models</li><li>The candy corn gun model</li><li>The AI logic</li><li>The shooting candy/throwing eggs logic (this took much more time than I\u00a0was hoping...)</li><li>Voice acting</li><li>The gun shooting sound effect</li><li>Crow sound effects</li><li>All of the UI (though, not much to be proud of there haha)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>3rd party credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I didn't make everything in the game; here are the creators of the assets I\u00a0did use:</p>\n<ul><li>Stylized Graveyard and Stylized Houses from Aleksandr Ivanov (paid): https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/AleksandrIvanov</li><li>Halloween Music Album 081919 from GWriterStudio (paid): https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/halloween-music-album</li><li>Amplify Animation Pack from Amplify Creations (paid): https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/amplify-animation-pack</li><li>Advanced Magic FX 13\u00a0(I think this was part of a free giveaway, but it's a paid product):\u00a0\u00a0https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/advancedmagicfx13</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Authors:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was solely created (with the exception of the above external assets) by Mike Seese (Discord mikeseese#0042)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T07:39:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/309/309ed8866a9a5ff615eb17f95a0e18ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Incanta Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
