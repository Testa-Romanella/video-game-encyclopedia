Use A to steer left, D to steer right and Space to shoot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Year 2222, for some reason everybody can only move 2 frames per second. Except you. And for some reason all the weapons can only shoot 2 bullets per second. You have a song playing in your head. The song's tempo is 120 bpm which is 2 beats per second. It can't be a coincidence, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are the only one in the whole universe. Everybody is after you. They blame you for all of this. But you heard a rumor about someone. Someone like you. Good luck with the search of the 2nd person who did not get effected by whatever this is.</p><p>And also this is my 2nd jam. I feel like J\u0131m Carrey in \"The Number 23\".</p>\n<p>Sprites from:</p>\n<p>https://ansimuz.itch.io/spaceship-shooter-environment</p>\n<p>Background elements from:</p>\n<p>https://ansimuz.itch.io/space-background</p>\n<p>Music from:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahfu1E_BBSI<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/031/031910007404be948882fda5b50dc525.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["metehankutlu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
