I was disappointed to see that there was no good place where you could play this game online, so I did what developers do and built it. You can play against a simple AI right now.<br/><br/>In game tutorial, selectable difficulty, better animations, better piece readability on the way.<br/><br/>FAQ<br/><br/>How do I play?<br/>- Click on the piece you want to move and click again move it. Read here for how pieces move. Your objective is to capture the opposing tiger.<br/><br/> You changed some of the piece names???<br/>- Yeah I did, get over it, why would you have pawns when lizards exist<br/><br/>This game doesn't work and it's glitchy, why would you release this<br/>- It will get better, this is just a first draft<br/><br/>You should be working on Burrow right now<br/>- Yes!!! Yes, yes I should,  but after 8 months of doing javascript for big corporations so I have an income again I deserve a little a game, as a treat. (I will be starting hard work on Burrow soon!!!!!)<br/><br/>This game sucks, I'd rather be playing chess<br/>- I actually think it's pretty cool :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T13:45:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7e/f7eaa10086efc289058591b5078ce161.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alligator Ventures"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
