If you are finding it hard to solve the last puzzles all I can say is that those puzzles are easier than they seem. Game was made for Gmtk jam with the theme : \"Only One\". The game goes by this theme with : \"You can move a box only one time\". More levels could not be added because of the time limit of the jam (48h) and the fact that it takes a long time to create puzzles that make sense.\u00a0If you really enjoyed the game consider leaving a rate.</p>\n<p>The game is more enjoyable when played on fullscreen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/470/4707a09d6ef9762a9702cd99d6f077c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Samuel Sb7"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
