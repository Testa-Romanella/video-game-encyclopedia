I started coding when I was 11 by making Minecraft (then called, Pocket Edition) mods on my tablet, you may have known me as MICAHMINER.\u00a0 Now I am entering my senior year of HS and hope to go to college for a BA in Computer Science or a related field. I have learned a lot since those days of creating crummy ModPE Scripts, however it has come around full circle since GMS2's GML is very similar to the JavaScript used to create those mods.</p>\n\n<p>Hey Micah, how nervous are you on releasing this? 11. Out of what? Just 11. But.. E-LEV-EN!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4e13d6ee0353127aefeec2cd73830be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["MicahTheManiac Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
