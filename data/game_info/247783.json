You need bring eggs to your camp.<br/></p>\n<p>To pick up egg press E. To use it in camp press\u00a0E.<br/></p>\n<p>If egg not in the camp it can spawn chicken. It can be your enemy (look at circle color under the chicken).<br/>All Chickens will fight with different color. Your goal is to kill all chickens from another army and destroy threre camp.</p>\n<p>At this time nothing will happen if you kill all enemies. But know - you win if you kill all)</p>\n\n<p>To Dodge press Space.</p>\n\n<p>How it relays to game theme?<br/>Well, all chickens spawn eggs when die. So it is reincarnation thing.<br/>Also, with right balance in this game it should be almost infinite. Because armies will reborn forever and no one will win. But in this case I have no time to balance it right.<br/><br/>P.S. If you die - wait. Maybe someone will bring egg in your camp and you will reborn.<br/></p>\n<p>P.P.S. I found bug when you reborn. I fixed it but cant reupload it.
