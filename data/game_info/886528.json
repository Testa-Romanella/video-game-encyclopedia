Droid 656 is now a fugitive and his main goal is to get to Earth safe and soul. Will you be able to make this happen regardless of the unforeseen events that may happen along the way?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What will you find?</strong></p>\n<p>Bomb Droid has currently 2 main levels and a playground. In those levels you will have to make your way through different puzzles, lasers, enemies like a giant droid or turrets and much more. You will find different power ups that will give certain ablities to Droid 656 and them you will be able to overcome any obstacle in your way.
