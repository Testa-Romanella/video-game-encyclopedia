Can you stand the test? Not everyone can get beautiful private photos. Please remember the 8 cards randomly issued by the system. You only have a few seconds to remember, and then all 8 cards will be covered. When the level boss issues a PK card, if the same card is selected from the 8 cards, an attack can be launched against the opponent. If the wrong card is selected, the opponent will be attacked. After defeating the boss, remember to add some skills to your skills, otherwise you may give up halfway and it is difficult to fight with the girls later.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T04:02:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f17/f17e61fee506433fef2c9baac80c1ad2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Time Works"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Time Works"], "esrb_rating": null}
