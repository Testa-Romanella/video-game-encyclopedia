You need to use the limited buttons you have to remap different actions on the map in order to reach the portal. You may start with some controls in your bag, on your character, or they may be laying on the map to be picked up. Any controls that are present on the map may be dragged around assuming they aren't locked in place.</p>\n<p>This was made using Love2D and lua. It was my first jam so this was an interesting experience.
