We love the Moon, so we put literally our souls in this project. Maybe it was too ambitious for the time limit, but we love the game we referenced so the effort was not in vain.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy playing as much as We did creating this game.</p>\n<p>If you are participating in this jam too, We wish you luck!</p>\n<p>Side note: The boss can't hit you, in the current jam build... Let's just say \"it's not a bug, it's a feature\" \ud83d\ude05 The whole game in general is kinda bugged, but we tried our best.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b9/7b9d7290e82cd76b0859966c0c13bb7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nikkocai", "Funky Pepe", "Max Tales"], "genres": ["Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
