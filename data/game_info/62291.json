Welcome to Curiosity, the game where you can hack. Try out different hacks, get creative, entertain yourself! And hey, maybe you&#39;ll find a secret or two along the way!<br />\nThis is an infinite platformer with horizontal player movement. When the game is started, two tabs open: one with the platformer itself, and one that appears to be a command prompt. A narrator starts speaking, and quickly notes that the platformer seems to be dull and uninteresting. He then tutorials the player on how to &quot;hack&quot;. &quot;Hacking&quot; gives the ability to change important variables in the code and to enable things that affect the environment.<br />\nAs the narrator will explain, to &quot;hack&quot;, the player must press the &quot;h&quot; key while the platformer tab is selected. The platformer will then freeze as it waits for input from the hacking tab (the one that looks like a command prompt). The player then must switch to the command prompt, type in a &quot;hack&quot;, and press enter. They will then be prompted to enter an integer (numbers), string (words), or boolean (true/false) to complete the hack. After completing the hack, the player can go back to the platformer to see what changed.<br />\nHere&#39;s an example of what happens in the hacking tab with a player doubling their speed:</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Enter Hack: speed</h2>\n<h2>Speed Hack:</h2>\n<p>Variable Type: Integer<br />\nDefault State: 6<br />\nCurrent State: 6</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Enter new speed: 12<br />\nHack Successful!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Hacking process complete<br />\nGo back to the game</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The game encourages using trial and error to see what each hack does (and using the hack &quot;list&quot; to see which hacks exist), but here&#39;s what they do if you don&#39;t want to test them out for yourself:<br />\n&quot;ascend&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, platforms rise into the sky whenever the player steps on them.<br />\n&quot;birdNumber&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the maximum amount of birds the player can spawn.<br />\n&quot;birdPoop&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, birds will occasionally drop bird poop.<br />\n&quot;birdPoopRate&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the rate at which birds can drop poop (&quot;birdPoop&quot; must be enabled to see this change).<br />\n&quot;birdSpeed&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the speed at which the birds fly.<br />\n&quot;blackhole&quot; - Enter a boolean. Enables a blackhole that sucks in all sprites and the player&#39;s mouse. The game warns you to have caution, since it will take control of your mouse while this hack is enabled.<br />\n&quot;clearScreen&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the command prompt is cleared.<br />\n&quot;clone&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, clones of the player can be created by pressing the space bar.<br />\n&quot;color&quot; - Enter three integers, as instructed. Affects the background color of the sky.<br />\n&quot;deathTouch&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the player destroys whatever they touch.<br />\n&quot;fly&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the player can fly.<br />\n&quot;gravity&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the strength of the game&#39;s gravity.<br />\n&quot;jump&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the player&#39;s jump height.<br />\n&quot;language&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Changes the language of the words &quot;Dull Platformer&quot; at the top of the tab, and of the &quot;Ouch&quot; said by sprites when they crash their heads into platforms.<br />\n&quot;list&quot; - Shows this list of hacks. Does not show the hack &quot;secret&quot;.<br />\n&quot;morph&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Changes the player into other sprites in the game. Your hit-box and abilities are updated accordingly.<br />\n&quot;mousePlay&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the player becomes your mouse, and the game attempts to give your mouse collision detection. As with the hack &quot;blackhole&quot;, the game cautions you that this hack will take control of your mouse.<br />\n&quot;multiplayer&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, a second player can join by playing on the same keyboard as instructed.<br />\n&quot;music&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Allows players to change the sounds of the game to a song, silence, or the tutorial again.<br />\n&quot;secret&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the birds and flowers get sunglasses.<br />\n&quot;speed&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the speed of the player.<br />\n&quot;weather&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Changes the weather of the platformer.<br />\nAs players experiment with different hacks, 5 pieces of a key can be found. When the player finds all 5 pieces, the narrator comes back to speak to you and the ending is unlocked.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T13:00:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f759b08e0a0032306379c8baa9a3281a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas Pellegrino"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nicholas Pellegrino"], "esrb_rating": null}
