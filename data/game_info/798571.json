The children\u2019s versions are recommended for parents playing together with kids between maybe 4 - 10 years (you know your kids best and decide after playing it solo first).\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Please do not let your kids play the original versions!\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For bug reporting and any questions feel free to contact us via support@tenboe-media.com\r\n </p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing.\r\n </p>\n<p>My next project is about to start soon \u2026!
