It's because we chose not to put the sound we tried to make since we were not skilled enough to make good sounding music.</p>\n<p>People who sweated out the heck of this jam to make this game ;D :<br/>- Altan4444 (https://ldjam.com/users/altan4444/)<br/>- Sacdeneu (https://ldjam.com/users/sacdeneu/)<br/>- Etoile (https://ldjam.com/users/etoile/)<br/>- MarcRobin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T07:08:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e85/e85e258905d17ad30bc7701deb09c302.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["MarcRobin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
