So it's like Shadowrun SRPG, kind of.</p>\n<p>Set in the future with space travel, the Nightmare Corporation takes prisoners, criminals, kidnapping victims, people in debt, anyone who they can get away with taking and they install implants in them to take away their choice. They use the excuse of karma and it's what they deserve though the people running the show are much, much worse.</p>\n<p>The Nightmare Corporation uses their mercenary slaves to complete missions on contract, selling their slaves out to the highest bidders for any mission at all.</p>\n<p>Play as one Nightmare Mercenary and his squad as they encounter the evil that is the Nightmare Corporation. Build your small squad out of either ranged Nightmares or Melee Nightmares and take on the dangers that await them on their suicide mission.</p>\n<p>A good and a bad ending are both possible, can you make it to the good ending?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T14:54:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11f56b8480e26241c487381d15219a00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpicyNoodleStudios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
