This is our very first game and we made it for the totally ranked jam.</p>\n<p>4 days is a very short time to make a game with 2 people (with 0 experience)\u00a0but we like to challenge ourselves. This game is still a work in progress of course and we are very excited about it.</p>\n<p>We didn't have time for tutorials in the game so here's what the game is all about.</p>\n<p>It's cold,\u00a0you lost the key to your house and have to find it. You are losing \"health\" 'cause of the coldness and you can regenerate it by standing near\u00a0the fireplaces you find. Press \"E\" to collect the key when you find it and then go back to your house to unlock the door, Press \"E\" infront of the door and the game will close.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T04:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5a/c5a274f059eff5e176ef6854b5a12de1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wrong Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
