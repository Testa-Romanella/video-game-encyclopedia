I built it following a course by James Doyle on Udemy. I am a beginner following my passion to learn game design.\u00a0</p>\n<p>**There are a few kinks that I couldn't figure out. As I learn more about game development, I will be able to fix these kinds of things or even avoid them. If anyone has any suggestions on fixing these it would be most welcome!</p>\n<p>- The character sticks to walls/slopes. I used Unity's starter assets for this game. The course I followed used a custom controller/script so it was difficult for me to figure out how to fix this issue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- The coins don't carry over to each level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Character sometimes moves automatically when respawning</p>\n<p>- Character doesn't stick to a horizontally moving platform</p><p>- There's a bug where you can randomly clip through the world (luckily no Backrooms).\u00a0</p><p>- The cursor shows while playing, but a workaround is that you pause the game and press \"Resume\". The cursor should disappear.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T09:23:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bf/9bf188d092954af41ac3d7475c942070.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jextech"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
