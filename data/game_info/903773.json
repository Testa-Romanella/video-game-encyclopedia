Not for you.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Sacrarium Gelus</em></strong> is a short fantasy-romance VN that follows its protagonist (name and pronouns\u00a0customizable) during one of the lowest points of their life. Unexpectedly, a curse mark has appeared on them, and, for the safety of their village, they have been driven out into the winter snow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only way forward that isn't wholly lethal is to traverse the dangerous, devil-infested\u00a0Mt. Gelus. They survive the long trip around. The only way forward is through it. This journey puts them under the cold gaze of the sole, formerly human denizen of this mountain: Heimos, the living god of medicine and winter. No one knows about this man beyond the legends...until they meet him themself.</p>\n<p>Will these interactions start off on the right foot? Will they learn more about\u00a0Heimos during their stay or maintain their distance? Will they try to steal from a living god?
