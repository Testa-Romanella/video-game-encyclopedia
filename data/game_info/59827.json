A plot of land awaits your green thumb to transform it into a booming farm, and a new world beckons you to explore its secrets. <br/><br/>Farm Folks offers a delightful mix of RPG and farming mechanics, giving you the freedom to get lost in the world while you build a farm from the ground up. There are many friends to be made, many crops and animals to tend, and a whole island to discover. What are you waiting for?<br/><br/><br/><br/>As you begin to nurture your plot, uncover great mysteries, and meet the citizens of the island, you\u2019ll experience the everlasting magnificence of your new home first-hand--all while you rekindle the memories from your past that caused you to embark on this grand, exciting adventure in the first place. You never would have guessed that finding your purpose in life was just a shipwreck away...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In Farm Folks, live your life as you see fit--there are so many experiences to be had! Working the land and rearing animals is a bunch of fun, but there is so much more on offer here. Let\u2019s run through what you can expect:<br/><br/><br/><br/>It wouldn\u2019t be much of a farming simulator without farming, would it? Farm Folks features the time-tested farming mechanic in which players can purchase or forage seeds and begin to grow their farm into a bountiful and rewarding resource.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Once the soil is tilled and the seeds are nestled firmly into the ground, it\u2019s time for some TLC--Tender Loving Care. You\u2019ll water your plants daily, either by hand or through other means, until each crop has reached its maturation and it\u2019s ready for harvest. Harvesting your hard-earned bounty can reward you in many ways, but if you\u2019re focusing on that bottom line, then it\u2019s time to put some coin in your purse.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>After loading your haul onto your trusty mount, you\u2019ll head into town and sell your goods to the island\u2019s exporters. As your purse grows fatter and fatter, the farming process can be enhanced and streamlined until you\u2019re running the island\u2019s most booming farm.<br/><br/>Soon you\u2019ll be wondering if it\u2019s time to invest in one of those fancy mainland automobiles....or maybe someone who can help out around the farm\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/>Softshoal Island\u2019s farmland is so very fertile because of the island\u2019s local animal population and the generations they\u2019ve spent grazing every acre of the luscious landscape. Today, farmers can continue to reap the rewards of Softshoal\u2019s four-legged (and two-legged!) friends by giving them homes on your property.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The local forester is also a great carpenter, and he\u2019ll make any kind of coop or stable that\u2019s available--for a price, of course. Once the structure is built, you\u2019ll need to stop by the nearby animal breeder to purchase some healthy livestock! Before you know it, you\u2019ll be in the ranching business. Milk, eggs, and wool, oh my!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nurture and care is key to making sure your livestock is producing worthwhile products. The happier your animal companions are, the higher the quality of their yield! Make sure you\u2019ve got your brushes and special feed handy!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sometimes reward is found outside the fences of your farm. You\u2019ll need to explore the wonderful and diverse settings of Softshoal to find the valuable items that can\u2019t be found on a shelf in the local general store. These resources include minerals and materials for upgrading your tools--usually mined from Softshoal\u2019s extensive cave system, or fish and other precious sea life that can be fished from the island\u2019s various rivers, lakes and coastlines.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Your progression is enhanced by what you find in the wilds of Softshoal, and sometimes searching for something trivial can lead to a grand adventure you never saw coming. Get out there and see what you can find--don\u2019t forget your pickaxe and fishing rod! <br/><br/><br/><br/>Softshoal\u2019s local community is a character-rich roster of living and breathing souls, all of which are just waiting to share their story with you. From those that live in the island\u2019s coastal town, Port Meridia, to those found out in the wilds, Farm Folks features a diverse, well-thought cast of over thirty characters. <br/>You\u2019ll meet them, find ways to further your relationships with them, and soon you\u2019ll know each one by name. These citizens offer quests a-plenty, and spout dialogue that\u2019ll keep you coming back for more. High relationships come with high rewards, but don\u2019t think everybody in Softshoal is going to be easy to please...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The seeds you sow in the community will quickly begin to bear fruit. However, you better be careful not to grow weeds! Build your relationships with townsfolk by giving them gifts, attending special events, performing quests, and remembering their birthdays. Earn enough favor and maybe the townsfolk will begin giving you gifts in kind. Some nuts are harder to crack than others, but with some finesse, they just might come around. You never know - you might even find love out there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There\u2019s beauty and intrigue found in every corner of Softshoal. It's a compelling place that calls the player ever further into the mysterious woods, down into the dangerous caves. As you explore, you\u2019ll see things that you\u2019ll never forget and you\u2019ll experience adventures worth re-telling.<br/><br/>And where better to relay your stories of heroism than back in Port Meridia? This fair-sized town has plenty of places to kick back and enjoy a day away from the farm, but it\u2019s also home to the many festivals that you don\u2019t want to miss! <br/><br/>Every season brings with it a great calendar of holidays that are perfect cause for celebration. You\u2019ll find the townsfolk have a festival for nearly every one of those occasions. Make sure you\u2019re there!  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Your character is a reflection of your personality (we assume that deep inside, everyone is an attractive, island-dwelling farmer). As such, they can be customized in any way you desire, including your gender. After creating a glorious persona, we know there will be fashionistas who want to take it a step further. Want to give them a more epic hairstyle or outfit? Visit the barber or tailor! You will soon become a shining star in the farming community.<br/><br/><strong>And so much more!</strong><br/><br/>Farm Folks is whatever you make of it. It\u2019s an adventure driven entirely by you. There is so much more to discover and so much more fun to be had when you get creative. Live this pleasant life to the best of your abilities and become the greatest farmer that Softshoal has ever seen!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6a47cda1efeff37feb5e502a8bb4714.jpg", "website": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bisonbit/farm-folks/posts/2224426", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Overgrown"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Overgrown"], "esrb_rating": null}
