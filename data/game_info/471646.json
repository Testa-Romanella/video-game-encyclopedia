Let me explain:</p>\n<p>We've been working on games for at least 3 years, but on all those years we've just created prototypes (and an educational project for a research center) and never focused on finishing projects.\u00a0 Therefore, this is technically our first game which sees the sunlight.</p>\n<p>We are \"<strong>Rhino Mode ON!</strong>\", a team composed by Elerson Palermo (programmer) and Andre de Lima (me, designer). We love minimalistic and retro games, especially those with a strong feeling of responsiveness,\u00a0 and we hope you guys feel that in this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right now we are managing things to work on another project (this time, something a little bigger).</p>\n<p>We hope you guys enjoy our game!\u00a0</p>\r\nThe RMO Team\u00a0sends the best regards to all of you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T04:33:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f7/0f7c225722cbcbc88483d099e5b0db5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["rhinomodeon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
