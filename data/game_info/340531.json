With my friends, we protected our kingdom and fought for our king.<br/>When some of my friends died, I decided I needed some rest, but our people can't understand how it's possible that a knight doesn't want to fight for them.\u00a0<br/>So I have to find a lonely place far away from here. And only one person can help me...it's Hackerman. He is the best hacker in the whole world.<br/>We began our adventure and I almost got to the final point, but Universe-security caught our signal and now they are trying to kill me.\u00a0<br/>Let's see if they have enough warriors.<br/>I hope I will find my Solitude.\u00a0<br/>Bye.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:29:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/260/2609813f50bfec7c562ac4f1c94f6ab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FidgetLand"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
