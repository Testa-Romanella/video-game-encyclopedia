Using timing and quick thinking dodge the obstacles located throughout the levels, collecting coins and avoiding danger! Short reload times mean the player can quickly retry each level, and they will find themselves being sucked into the game, just trying to get that little bit further through each level.<br/><br/>Currently a prototype game, made up of four whitebox levels which increase in difficultly. No art has been made currently as the protoype is simply testing out how much fun the game is to play. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nially55"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
