And, as if the situation\u00a0weren't already <em>out of control</em> enough, Jimothy somehow made it to the Anchovy Temple (which isn't underwater, because anchovies can fly, obviously), where the intense aura of salt permeating the air is slowly eroding his cognitive processes, so that he forgets how to move his body every so often and has to re-learn (he never forgets how to shoot potatoes, though, strangely... must've done it from a younger age than walking).</p>\r\nWhat buttons must I hit?\r\n<p>Jimothy aims at the nearest anchovy scum and fires his potato cannon automatically. Use WASD to move... at first. <strong>As you use a movement key, its charge drains, and when it runs out it gets\u00a0replaced by a new random alphabet key.</strong> Good luck mastering <em>these</em> controls!\u00a0;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:55:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c1/0c1e83ada5d68cf6a76e9731485202b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anjosustrakr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
