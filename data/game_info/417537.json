There are 8 worlds in total. The reason for not launching all these at once is so I can finish extra polish and audio work.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>CONTROLS</em></strong><strong> (because I\u2019m not making a new tutorial section of the game until the entire game is done).</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD=move</p>\n<p>Left Shift=dash (space to cancel a dash)</p>\n<p>Space=HOP/JUMP IN PLACE (Must be sitting still) </p>\n<p>LEFT CONTROL+WASD =pull/grab a puzzle cube\u00a0(more so if you get one stuck in a corner)</p>\n<p>ARROW KEYS=camera move</p>\n<p>E KEY=zoom in camera</p>\n<p>R KEY= restart level</p>\n<p>ESC- quit game</p>\n<p><strong>*Note you can also play with a gamepad*.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IF YOU HAVE\u00a0SOUND ISSUES:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>If you dislike the audio quality or the audio levels, open your sound volume mixer and mute the game.

This will make the cage holding a living captured brown bokube open. Touch them to move into the next level. </li><li>You can push puzzle cubes into living enemies to kill them. Puzzle cubes don\u2019t effect traps however.</li><li>\u00a0Survive boss encounters to eventually finish them off with a puzzle cube. (Some bosses will take multiple hits from a puzzle cube).</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:34:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cca/ccaa05d848aad9a18a18f0cfa347d9e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Conception Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
