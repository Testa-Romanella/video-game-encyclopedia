Literally the maximum this could possibly be worth in pure time is 15 cents (at least in California). If you liked it, share it with others, and explain to them that I am very, very sorry. </p><p>If by some miracle you want more like this, and my horrible poetry hasn't made you gouge your eyes out, let me know!
