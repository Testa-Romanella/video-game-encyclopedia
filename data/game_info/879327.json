The ghost wanders around the village, breaks into locked houses, and kills the men who live inside. Does that sound like a creepy fairy tale?</p>\n<p>It's a folk belief that runs throughout Southeast Asia. Every year in Thailand, dozens of men die in their beds at night under unusual circumstances: they fall asleep, never to wake up again.

It tells the story of several eccentric tourists trapped on an island in Thailand because of a pandemic. When one of the villagers mysteriously dies, the characters begin an investigation and conclude that the death may have been caused by... a ghost?<br/><br/>Has the legend come to life, or are the creatures of flesh and blood at fault? Could it have been a tragic accident? \"No men in this house\" is an absurdist detective thriller full of bizarre situations, erratic characters, biting humor, and twists you won't see coming!</p>\n<ul><li>55,000 words<br/>\n</li><li>Non-generic, awesome OST (seriously!)<br/>\n</li><li>8 characters and a grumpy cat named Cilantro<br/>\n</li><li>Story based on real events<br/>\n</li><li>30 Full HD backgrounds based on actual locations\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Music by Pavel Pichugin\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/pavel-pichugin-1<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T14:32:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74d/74d1d499a339c1f21bb4d887f58a01a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anastasia Erokhina"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
