You have a limited amount of moves per turn.\u00a0 But beware, the more humans you pick up, the less moves you have!\u00a0Once you run out of moves, the aliens in the same room as you have a turn to move. Be strategic and chose a path where the aliens can't reach you!</p>\n<p>If you run into an alien, you have two choices: sacrifice a human for a 100% chance of survival, or fight the alien for a 50% chance of survival.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits: Annie Xu (Programming, Art, Design), Echonox (Programming, Music, Design)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e2/5e2e8fc8d61214b0b3f8ced8158c460b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Echonox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
