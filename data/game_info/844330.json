We have two abilities.</p>\n\n<p>One of them creates a shield around our tank and we can rotate the turret and shield of the tank at the same time. Press Space to activate the shield ability. Our shield ability has a specific health. As enemy shells hit our shield, our shield's health decreases. If no bullet has touched our shield, the shield goes into cooldown when the specified active time expires. If the player upgrades the size of the shield ability, the shield size increases. The cooldown of the shield ability is shortened if the player chooses an upgrade that prefers to shorten the cooldown of the shield ability.</p>\n\n<p>Our other ability allows him to drop mines from a certain point in the rear of the tank. Press \"E\" key to activate mine skill. The mine remains there until the enemies touch it. If the player upgrades the size of the mine skill, the size of the mine increases. If the player chooses the upgrade that prefers to increase the damage of the mine ability, the damage of the mine ability is increased.</p>\n\n<p>There is an armed train running around the playground. It's a distraction that's easy to kill, but hard to stumble upon while fighting and escaping other enemies. Like our other enemies, turrets on the train have hit points and bullets.</p>\n\n<p>We have 4 different types of enemies in the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our first enemy type is Lav-25.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our second enemy type is Lanchester Armoured Car.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Our third enemy type is the Humvee.</p>\n\n<p>Our fourth enemy type is the Panther Tank.</p>\n<p>There is an upgrade system in the game. A total of 8 upgrades are currently available. In the future I can focus on increasing them. Let's see what these upgrades are.\r\n</p>\n<p>To increase the damage of our tank's shells.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Increasing our tank's health and healing.</p>\n\n<p>Increasing the movement speed of our tank.</p>\n\n<p>Increasing the size of our shield.</p>\n\n<p>Reducing the cooldown of our shield.</p>\n<p>Increasing the rate of fire of our tank.</p>\n\n<p>Increasing the size of our mines.</p>\n\n<p>Increasing the damage of our mines.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T19:20:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b57/b57e70ce0f119334e83905f7399ef78b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Berkay Ozcan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
