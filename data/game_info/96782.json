Colossal Cave Adventure - Icicle Edition aims to hold true to the spirit and atmosphere of the original game, but does make some content and puzzle concessions in order to fit better with the Icicle engine's interface and structure.</p><p>For more information, visit adventure.icicle-engine.org!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/220/2203e0394c5ff0919e697326034c18c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cheeseness"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
