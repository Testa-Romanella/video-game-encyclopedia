Each matched tile will paint the board with player\u2019s color. Whoever paints a majority of the board as first wins. Two players can battle each other but also one player can play with an AI opponent. The game features a cyberpunk-inspired futuristic setting with 3D graphics, 5 distinct locations, 3 difficulty levels and 3 different game modes ranging from tactical turn-based to hectic real-time gameplay.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You and your opponent can make moves at the same time. Will you be faster, or will you yield in defeat.<br/><br/><br/>Every turn, you have a limited time, but you can make as many moves as you want.<br/><br/><br/>Every turn, you can only make one move so think deeply to gain maximum possible advantage. Be careful though, because the time limit exists!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Combo make you win faster.<br/><br/><br/>Use special ability to make a difference.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T03:15:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5b14327963148d7c2c3bc6504b41060.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROOKIEZ FROM WARSAW"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ROOKIEZ FROM WARSAW"], "esrb_rating": null}
