Enjoy my painstakingly made models in all their underwater glory!</p>\n<p>The idea is that you are an old timey diver (yeah, in one of those vintage diving suits!) who has discovered a strange location under the sea. In the center is an old temple, seemingly untouched by the ocean's currents. Everything is preserved. What's inside?</p>\n<p>Controls are WASD to walk around, mouse to look, and space to jump. Left click to interact and right click to zoom in on any objects.</p>\n<p>Also available to download is some additional background information on the creation of the myth for this project. We were encouraged in class to make an environment from a myth, so I chose to mix the myths of Medusa and Atlantis together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>:) hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Used in this project are the following resources:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Kinoton/sounds/393819/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/HDVideoGuy/sounds/156011/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/@realdavidfloat/sounds/418939/<br/>^^^^^ SOUNDS USED TO MAKE BACKGROUND MUSIC<br/>http://torahhorse.com/first-person-drifter-controller-for-unity3d<br/>^^^^^ FIRST PERSON CONTROLLER USED<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5v_X1k02U0<br/>^^^^^ SOURCE FOR LIGHTING <br/><em>______________________</em><br/>All models and textures made by me unless they\u2019re in the links above.<br/>Story made by me, and the readings of the story are me talking into a ZOOM 4 microphone. <br/>Any code that\u2019s not in those packages above are made by me too.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/414a98c3fd8b38e118356fe9632e146c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
