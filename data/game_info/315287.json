Your entire life is collecting different currencies from unwary tourists. The thief lives in Mal\u00e1 strana (Lesser Town of Prague) and steals at Malostransk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed (Lesser Town Square). He steals at noon and in the afternoon. You are stealing via the minigame.</p>\n<p>You move by arrows, pick as many different currencies possible and then before the timer depletes you leave the pocket by pressing spacebar. But beware! It takes some time to roll your long hand out. Those black circles are revealed after you are close enough.</p>\n<p>Some interesting facts:<br/>You can actually see the building we were working at - Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University\u00a0 (on the right). The sound of the square was really recorded at that square.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Team:<br/>- maoap - teamleading, programming, game design<br/>- Bee Sundance - art, level design, thief voice<br/>- Cyrdach - programming, UI design<br/>- Standaaad - sound, screenplay</p>\n<p>Special thanks for people at the MFF site for voices of other characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:43:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d43b8e112714de2e6ef593ad32402dbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["maoap"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
