Still, maybe an even more terrible biological weapon known as Z Virus vector was brought to bear. Z virus is a deadly poison and a lot of people got sick and most died. Some became living dead (virus resistant) <br/><br/>The citizen who were not infected by the Z weapon,  became trigger happy and started a zombie hunt. The undead started rising but 1 by 1 they got shot by the humans. The zombie massacre had started. The living made sure the dead became a roadkill by shooting them in the head. <br/><br/>Eventually they found other ways to slaughter the undead: Killer wall spikes! Those deadly walls really worked and the living dead started learning to avoid them. They don\u2019t touch the spikes anymore!  <br/><br/>The zombie massacre lasted exactly 28 days. After 28 days, the assault on the evil undead was over. The outbreak and horror was almost over. A large swath of land was marked as \"dead zone\" and protected with the deadly wall spike system.
