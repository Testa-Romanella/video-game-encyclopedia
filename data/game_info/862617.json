Of course that didn\u2019t go unnoticed and the police is right behind you. Try to escape in the bad weather conditions with broken wipers, cleaning your windshield only every 10 seconds!</p>\n<p>A Ludum Dare 51 entry built to test Godot 4 beta 2, so there might be some engine related crashes.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>The project was built using Godot 4.0 beta 2, so there is sadly some engine crashes we cannot fix ourselves, as well as steeper performance requirements than we'd like. Anything with at least 3GB VRAM should run the game fine, but below that, it's a gamble. The lowest spec devices we tested on were a laptop GTX 1650 and a Steam Deck.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>- PickyDogFish: <em>Programming, SFX Selection</em><br/>- LunarRuin: <em>Programming</em><br/>- TheRedDevil: <em>Programming</em><br/>- negdo: <em>3D Art</em><br/>- grizeldi: <em>VFX, 3D art, UI Implementation</em><br/>- Timotej979: <em>Music Composition</em><br/>- Anzy: <em>UI Design</em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:27:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/6539b95d9a4218a46d41f8f16387c9a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["grizeldi", "negdo", "ImTheRedDevil", "PickyDogFish", "LunarRuin"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
