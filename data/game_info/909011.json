How quickly can you harvest them all?</p>\r\nThe Environment\u00a0\r\nThe Bugs\r\n<p>To harvest the bugs, you need to get in their range, fire a web at them, and then wrap around them once so that they can be consumed! You will run into some of these bugs:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Web Grapple Points</strong></p>\n<p>There are some points hanging in air that you can attach your web to, and then swing around on to reach new platforms! Look for these spots where the icon changes to being web-able and try jumping at them and shooting your web!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Level Elements</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cobwebs</strong> will speed you up as you walk on them</p>\n\n<p><strong>Puddles </strong>will slow you down as you walk on them</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trampolines</strong> will launch you in the air when you step on them</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spikes</strong>\u00a0will kill you if you step on them</p>\n\n\r\nThe Team\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Jaden Goter: Team Lead, Programming\r\n</li><li>Tessa Hardin: Art, UI, and Textures\r\n</li><li>Erik Skoog: Music, Programming\r\n</li><li>Jianfeng Sun: 3D Modelling, Animation\r\n</li><li>Camden Obertop: Programming, Level Design!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T15:41:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb3/fb35ae61001561c7c7a55ae3186ed0a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["camdeno"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
