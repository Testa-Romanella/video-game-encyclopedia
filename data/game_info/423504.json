In this prototype game, I explore how to evoke certain emotions and feelings, such as discomfort and stress, through using audio sequences as well as in game effects, with very minimal focus on character and environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The purpose of this prototype, overall, is to experiment with emotional realism and to see if using the elements previously mentioned can create a game experience where the reality of the game does not draw on the photo realistic and mimicry of the real world but focuses on the realms of emotion and feeling.</p><p>Movement- Simply use the WASD or Arrow Keys to move.</p><p>Exit Game- Press Esc button</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:24:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a4f68f42d79548378c96203c48567f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Consc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
