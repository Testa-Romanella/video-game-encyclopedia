Stop \n      them by launching new marbles with your stylus. When three or more \n      like-colored marbles match up, they vanish. Tons of power-ups, multiple \n      tracks and a great multiplayer mode make Magnetica a must for \n      puzzle/action fans!\n    </p><p>\n      A seemingly endless array of fresh twists will keep drawing you back to \n      single-player Magnetica.
