{"id": 99393, "slug": "cosmos-remake", "name": "Cosmos Remake", "name_original": "Cosmos Remake", "description": "<p>Cosmos tries to be a combination of arcade action and very light-weight strategy game. The player controls the construction and defense of the gargantuan intergalactic starbase, named Kyplos, invented by the diplomatic race of Kalaktians to serve as the policing force in their pirate-ridden sector of Cosmos. </p><p>A political decision was made, however, as it often is the case in such circumstances, the funding was then later cut down by the bureaocrats, before the construction was finished. Many components of the Kyplos are therefore still missing, and, most importantly, its hull integrity is unable to withstand hyperspace ejection. </p><p>To raise additional funds, the construction yard has been selected as a hyperspace node. Defending the convoys en-route through the node, the Kyplos collects insurance fees, thus gaining resources for project completion. The player's final goal is to seal the Forecity with a dome and make the colossus stable enough for interstellar travel. </p><p>In exchange for the credits, other components of the Kyplos may also be upgraded, such as: Photonics, the rear turbine with 11 beam coils, which serves both as the station's drive and cannon, the Core, which powers everything from laser batteries to shields and production, and the Factory where Kyplos support fighters are built and then stationed inside the three Docking bays. </p><p>Cosmos Remake homepage &amp; full instructions</p><p>sinister systems on Patreon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/123/12379b5bc9fbb3540f28476d045e9741.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["charon@ss"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
