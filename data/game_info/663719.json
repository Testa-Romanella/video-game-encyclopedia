But you better pick up the pace, your air supply seems to be decreasing faster than it should be, and that strange humming in the radio equipment is perhaps the most unsettling sound you\u2019ve ever heard... Like whispers from another dimension.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Those before you...</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>It seems like your crew wasn\u2019t the first to crash here\u2026 corpses, shipwrecks, and even some diaries are sprawled around this area. It seems like an underwater aberration with psychic powers has brought many people to an early grave here - and it is growing larger with every passing day. Perhaps your submarine\u2019s wreckage was no accident! You can feel that staying here isn\u2019t a great idea - better get to climbing.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Will you be another corpse... or a survivor?</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have to face many challenges to survive this wreckage - mutated aquatic animals more akin to monsters than they are to natural sealife, deadly mines constructed from scrap metal and scavenged electronics, and the wrath of a cosmic monstrosity bent on corrupting this world. The fate of the earth rests on your will to survive, sailor.
