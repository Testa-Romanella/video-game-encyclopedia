He had become EvilJam!\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the same Ethelston Ainsworth was trying out a new recipe for a beer which included herbs and the tears of a virgin (his own) - when the explosion shook his little brewery and a bucket full of his urine fell unseen into the unbrewed beer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the beer was done he took a deep sip - and had to vomit instantly, shouting: \"IT'S PISS ACTUALLY!\". But the beer was ready to be bottled and the people were thirsty, so he marked all bottles with the letters IPA and shipped it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just when he had delivered the last bottle he saw something that looked like a gigantic marmalade jam on the horizon coming fast towards him...</p>\n<p>He decided to run for his life! Hopefully he doesn't run into any IPAs!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets used:</strong></p>\n<p>Castle Dungeon \u2013 Fantasy pixelart tileset\u00a0 by AAMATNIEKSS\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pixel Font pack by mattWalkden</p>\n<p>Food and Kitchenware pixelart icons</p>\n<p>Pixelart game backgrounds by\u00a0MGG</p>\n<p>Fantasy Medieval Environment by Ansimuz</p>\n<p>8-bit tunes by Cactus Bear</p>\n<p>8-bit sfx pack by Cactus Bear</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T08:04:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adc/adc36115ebc9c70b501cc4923483a99b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bucket-full-games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
