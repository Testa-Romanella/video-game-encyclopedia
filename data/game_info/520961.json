The theme for this jam is John Cage's famous song, 4'33\", which is a special piano piece where the musician sits at a piano without playing for over four minutes. In this NPR story (https://www.npr.org/2000/05/08/1073885/4-33), the piece is described as \"a music that, when it engaged you, made the present world open up like a lotus blossoming in stop-motion photography.\"</p>\n<p>To meet this theme, I decided to avoid making an actual game with objectives. Instead, this is simply a nature scene in my little homage to Bob Ross, with \"Happy Little Trees\" and snow-covered mountains,\u00a0featuring paintings I have done in his style. To prevent any real need for the player to move much, the paintings are all in the clearing where the player spawns.</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>Q to quit the game</p>\n\n<p>Assets Used</p>\n<p>Nature Assets - Procedural Worlds\u00a0https://www.procedural-worlds.com/</p>\n<p>Easel - Blendswap\u00a0https://www.blendswap.com/blend/19011</p>\n<p>Picture Frame - GameDevHQ Filebase\u00a0https://filebase.gamedevhq.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:03:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca8/ca84a63fbf31cde1c4d2098b288aa193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Weenie Walker Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
