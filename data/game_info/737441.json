If the currency is not used, then it loses its value and starts to decay. It would act as a UBI (Universal Basic Income) and complementary digital currency in various communities.</p>\n<p>The story can be toggled off in the settings, turning the game into an endless runner with the theme of currency and ggool.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[PC] <br/></strong></p>\n<p>Left (A), Right(D) - move left, right<br/></p>\n<p>Click or Ctrl - shoot a coin</p>\n<p><strong>[Mobile]</strong></p>\n<p>Swipe left, swipe right - move left, right</p>\n<p>Swipe up - shoot a coin<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay on PC:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay on Android:</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T09:23:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd4482945adfe83246b5fb2a7006a790.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["bogdaan"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
