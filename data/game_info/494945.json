Obviously doesn't come with the game for legal reasons and that'll just be wrong. I just thought there were some very basic improvements to be made like hiding the cursor and basic keyboard support. There are a few bugs like everything but most should work. There are instructions on how to use this menu in the zip file. This may get picked up by anti virus but is not harmful in any way, it's just cause this file doesn't get downloaded much and is not known.</p>\n<p>To the owner of Downhill.
