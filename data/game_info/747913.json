That's the whole intention of this little project, after all. It could also just be used to gush about what a good day you had to, though.\u00a0<br/>It should be playable on anything, as its an .html game, but i haven't tested it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T14:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e7/0e7f7499fb0cbf76ce7c445f4ff2264a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Omnidimensional"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
