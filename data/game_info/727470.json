The car doesn't have a pilot, but you are the navigator. Plot the course and break records!<br/><br/>- Four unique cups: from tropic islands to the cold mountain tops;<br/>- Eight cars: a small hatchback or a rally muscle car? Who said muscle cars can't drift?<br/>- The only thing you need is a mouse. The keyboard is optional, though ;)<br/>- Voxel graphics. Our artist did his best, believe it (or better yet - check it out yourself)<br/>- Use the handbrake on difficult tracks and nitro - on every one. Nitro is cool.<br/>- Global leaderboards.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for?
