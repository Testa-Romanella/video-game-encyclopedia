(even j0shmth does not know about this!)</em><br/><br/><strong><em>Controls:<br/></em></strong>WAD \u00a0\u00a0 - movement<br/>[space] - alternative jump[ESC] \u00a0 \u00a0- pause</p>\n<p><strong><em>Development:<br/></em></strong>Development was a biiig hassle.<br/>The time was low and the stress level high. <br/>While j0shmth was drawing the assets, Proliecan was coding the sh*t out of the engine. The developer and 2D artist worked 3hrs each. To wait for the assets and animations, Proliecan decided to split his time to 2 Days and take the third day for publishment (which was not included in the 3hrs). Unfortunately, the team could work on the game only in the late evenings or at night. 2hrs and 20 Minutes into developing time (Proliecans's time), the unity engine decided to crash and needed a reinstall. Because of old and <em>really</em> slow hardware, it was unclear if the game could be finished and submitted within the deadline until the very end.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T07:34:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/701/7014d907fa65426234f4922aa3d08e1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Proliecan", "j0shmth"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
