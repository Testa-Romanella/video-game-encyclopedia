By holding and dragging the mouse, you can adjust the shooting angle of the pinball, which will be automatically launched. Your goal is to hit the little monsters with numbers on them, as hitting them will reduce the numbers displayed on the blocks. Once the number reaches zero, the monsters will disappear, and you will earn corresponding points.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are special elements in the game that enhance your abilities. Eliminating the monsters with star symbols will increase your attack power, making your pinballs more powerful. Additionally, eliminating the monsters with extra pinballs will increase the number of pinballs you have, giving you more opportunities for continuous shots.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, you must be cautious of the monsters' attacks. If the monsters surpass the bottom red line, the game will end. At the end of the game, you will receive a certain percentage of gold coins as a reward based on the score you achieved in that round. Utilize these gold coins to purchase various items that will enhance your abilities. Choosing the right items and using them at the right time can help you achieve higher scores.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFurthermore, as you accumulate a sufficient number of stars, you can unlock exquisite CG images in the gallery. These images will become precious collectibles in your gaming journey, showcasing your achievements in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAre you ready to challenge the limits of shooting? Let the whirlwind of pinball shooting bring you endless fun and a sense of accomplishment!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-04T05:57:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/242/2426ae31ca4dba619ee339a695b592c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CP games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CP games"], "esrb_rating": null}
