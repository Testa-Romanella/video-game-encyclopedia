But beware, in order to stand on that platform, you need to have the bug with the same color with that platform. For example, in order to stay on the red platform, you need to have at least one red bug. Each bug corresponds to 5 second of staying on that platform. If you do not have bug of that color, you will lose health. After 10 seconds, you will lose all of your health and the pet shop owner will grab you.</p>\n<p>Team:</p><p>Aleyna \u00d6zt\u00fcrk: 2D Artist</p><p>Halil \u00d6mer Koruko\u011flu: 2D Artist</p><p>Kaan Oyman: Programmer</p>\n<p>Kemal \u00c7a\u011flar G\u00fcler: Programmer</p><p>Ya\u011fmur Ya\u015far:\u00a02D Artist</p>\n<p>PS:</p>\n<p>This is a prototype that only contains one level that only has one level to only show you the basic mechanics of the game.
