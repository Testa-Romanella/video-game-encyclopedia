Soft moans and cries can be heard from below, as you notice the creaking sound of something being lowered from the ceiling. A silver tray with a meal underneath meets your gaze. Slowly, the realisation of the buttons dawns on you as you now have a choice to make.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>THEME \"LESS IS MORE\"</em></strong></p>\n<p>The less food you take for your own salvation, the more you can feed the other floors trapped in the same scenario.
