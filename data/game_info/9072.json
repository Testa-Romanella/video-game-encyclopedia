The more you play, the more your palms will start to sweat! So make sure you\u2019ve got a firm grip on your Iphone ;)<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY?<br/>==================================<br/>Draw clouds on the screen to keep Nuonuo from falling.<br/><br/>The lower on the screen you create the cloud. The higher Nuonuo will jump.<br/><br/>Change Nuonuo\u2019s direction by drawing the cloud in different directions.<br/><br/>Make sure Nuonuo avoids the dark clouds. <br/><br/>They\u2019ll slow him down and push him back.<br/>Bouncing off the bottom of a cloud will bounce Nuonuo right back, and you\u2019ll have to respond quickly to draw another cloud.<br/><br/>The higher Nuonuo climbs, the higher his score becomes.<br/><br/>On Nuonuo\u2019s way up, he can collect nuts to gain points, or magic mushrooms as powerups. These powerups allow Nuonuo to travel through all obstacles.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES<br/>==================================<br/>Nuonuo will randomly change shapes through a new animation technology. These shapes influence the way he interacts with his environment!<br/><br/>Each element in the game is generated randomly. This way the player has a new experience every time he plays.<br/>An innovative design for bosses and items makes Nuonuo\u2019s floating experience harder as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Players can decide for themselves if they want to post their high scores to the leader boards!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e8/4e8ea62a2fac4bef073ba19faaa7d7a6.jpeg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/NuoNuo/205373784141", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["The 7th Petal"], "genres": ["Action", "Family"], "publishers": ["kai feng"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
