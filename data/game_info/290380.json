If you have thoughts, leave a comment on this page or come yell at me.<br/></p>\n<p>When the game loads, type in whatever you want for a room name and hit \"PLAY.\" If your friends type in the same name, they'll join your room. They'll show up as giant arrows once you start.<br/></p>\n<p>Stay low and race to the goal! Gravity is reversed, so if you get too high off the ground, you'll float into the abyss and lose. Also, every enemy you pop gets sent to your opponents. So if you want to slow them down, fire that laser!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T03:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a39/a39a2eda33da1ebd166f75274c24929b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Surka"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
