Now, she must try and escape by solving the myriad of puzzles placed throughout these eleven rooms, and maybe figure out why she was abducted in the first place.</p><p>This is my first attempt at making something in the RPG Maker engine. For this project, I focused on just making a basic adventure game without using the battle system or any additional bells or whistles. Eleven Rooms uses no external plugins, with the only modifications being a few altered graphics. After working on this off-and-on for about a month, it's finally in a state where I can call it \"finished\". I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T07:30:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35d/35d7ad79f0b58d8803b6a8c35e292b9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Victikirby15"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
