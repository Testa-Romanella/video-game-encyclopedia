{"id": 625704, "slug": "combined-arms-operations-series", "name": "Combined Arms Operations Series", "name_original": "Combined Arms Operations Series", "description": "The Combined Arms Operations Series (CAOS) uses simultaneous turns to simulate operational level combat between World War II armies across national boundaries and years. Ever wanted to see Soviet and US forces face off in 1945? Or Germany 1939 versus Italy 1942? Here\u2019s your shot. <br/><br/>Follow historical doctrines or rewrite them entirely as you reorganize historical armies to match your command style. See for yourself how the Soviet army could perform in 1941 outside the confines of Operation Barbarossa. Mix and match units from across the German army to create the ultimate combined arms kampfgruppe in 1944. Mass enough American artillery to blot out the sun. Whatever your playstyle, CAOS is happy to provide, with more than 4000 unique units and 580 historically accurate division and brigade formations. <br/><br/>Scenarios in CAOS are fast paced and self-contained. Players can choose between anything from small battles between a couple divisions that can be played in under and hour, to sprawling army level battles involving dozens of divisions and hundreds of units that can be played across several days. Multiplayer scenarios are synchronous, allowing you to see your ally issue orders in real time, easily coordinate your battleplans, and even transfer control of units between players.<h3>Simulate Operational Combat:</h3>CAOS uses simultaneous turn resolution and highly mobile combat to recreate the chaotic nature of combined arms warfare in a turn-based strategy game. Use armored spearheads to smash through enemy lines and create deep encirclements. Infiltrate commandos through rugged mountains to cut off hostile lines of supply. Pound enemies into submission from afar with artillery and aircraft. Destroy bridges, build fortifications, and construct minefields to force your rivals to fight on your terms. But remember, no plan of battle survives contact with the enemy. Be prepared to adapt quickly to an evolving battlefield and outmaneuver your opponents.<h3>Customize Your Army:</h3>Reorganize entire divisions to suit your playstyle or combine units across divisional lines to create specialized battlegroups custom-tailored to your mission. Feel free to recreate historical battlegroups or experiment with alternative force structures. But don\u2019t stop there, necessity is the mother of invention. As your army is bloodied, compensate for diminishing reserves by creating even more novel battlegroups from the battered remnants of your forces.<h3>Key Features:</h3><ul><li>Command German, Soviet, American, British, Italian, and French forces from 1939-1945.<br/></li><li>Simultaneous (WeGo) turn resolution.<br/></li><li>Customize historical forces by retraining and reorganizing units and merging them into custom battlegroups.<br/></li><li>4468 Units detailed down to every tank, artillery piece, and rifle squad.<br/></li><li>Combined arms warfare: deploy tanks, infantry, artillery, and aircraft to wage blitzkrieg against your opponents or grind them into the dust through attrition. <br/></li><li>Long range artillery: Provide fire support or pound your enemies from many hexes away.<br/></li><li>Fog of war and reconnaissance: Use recon units and aircraft to watch your flanks and track your enemy\u2019s maneuvers.<br/></li><li>Three game types, ranging from small meeting engagements to full-scale invasions. <br/></li><li>Randomized objective selection and starting zones to enhance replayability.<br/></li><li>Single player, synchronous head-to-head PvP and 2 player co-op.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T02:38:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44a/44ab6782d7401de9e15c1fd30bd014e1.jpg", "website": "http://www.ns2games.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nemeton Singularity Simulations"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Nemeton Singularity Simulations"], "esrb_rating": null}
