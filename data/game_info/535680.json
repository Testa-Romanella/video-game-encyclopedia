The experimental mantis has grown huge!\"<br/><br/>An accident that suddenly came under a doctor who was secretly absorbed in illegal research ...<br/>It was a runaway mantis that became huge due to experiments!<br/><br/>Not only will human damage occur if nothing is done, but doctors' illegal research will come to light!<br/><br/>He is not confident in his strength and has no strong weapons at hand. But you have to do something about it.<br/><br/>Is the mantis dangerous, or is the doctor's tomorrow dangerous?<br/>Use a wide variety of weapons to kill the giant mantis before anyone finds it!<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><br/>\"Challenge the giant mantis realistically reproduced in VR!\"<br/><br/>This game is a game that aims to challenge the giant mantis that is realistically projected by VR from the front and kill it with your abilities.<br/><br/>In a mountain where there are no useful weapons such as firearms, you start with no help other than limited supplies.<br/>Let's make full use of our human power to think about how to fight against a giant mantis who mercilessly wields a vicious sickle while keeping its characteristics as a living thing.<br/><br/>In addition to manipulating the hands and field of view with the VR controller, the player can move naturally with the stick.<br/>You can freely choose possible actions such as preventing the mantis attack with a weapon, running and avoiding it, and immediately approaching and attacking.<br/><br/><br/>There are more than 40 types of weapons and items that appear. However, none of them can be a deadly factor for a powerful mantis on its own.<br/>A magical item that restores HP immediately when used? \u2026 No, it doesn't exist.<br/>A bazooka cannon that blows enemies into pieces just by shooting? \u2026 No, it doesn't exist.<br/>All that appears in the game are the junk in the mountains and the mysterious items created by the whims of the doctor.<br/>All you can do is hit or throw with those items.<br/><br/><br/>Perhaps you will have a very difficult time. But that's not unreasonable.<br/>Because you have never actually fought or even prepared for a giant mantis.<br/><br/>What if you cleared this game in just one play?<br/>The development team recognizes you as a stronger creature than a lion.<br/>What if you could easily clear it as a result of dozens or hundreds of challenges?<br/>It's okay to actually meet a giant mantis at any time.<br/><br/>If you are confident in your arm or if you are confident in dealing with mantis, please play it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T03:50:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80b/80b99bf117848cbd01ad9fcffc22f8a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TATSUMI ELECTRONICS"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TATSUMI ELECTRONICS"], "esrb_rating": null}
