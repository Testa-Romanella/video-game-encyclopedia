{"id": 908477, "slug": "terminal-velocity-demo", "name": "Terminal Velocity (DEMO)", "name_original": "Terminal Velocity (DEMO)", "description": "<p>In Terminal Velocity, you have been dispatched to handle a rogue bullet train that has been overrun by rampant, zombie-like robots. Utilizing the minimal light and resources at your disposal, can you make your way to the controls, bring the vehicle to a stop and ultimately escape with your life?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CORE MECHANICS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Fight, sneak or run through <strong>randomly-seeded train cars,</strong> each filled with ambling, robotic menaces, to advance to the front of the train. Neon lights will be your ally - whether it be through muzzle flashes, thrown flares or brief illuminations from passing lights, <strong>you must improvise to see your enemy.</strong> To further complicate matters, you have<strong> limited ammunition and time</strong>\u2026 carelessly firing into the darkness will bite you, so make every shot count!\r\n</p>\n<p>\tAlong the way, you will find <strong>Health Packs, Flares and Ammo Boxes</strong> that will make your life a little easier.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>SELLING POINTS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Terminal Velocity is a game that builds its challenge around a unique aesthetic presentation. Minimalistic visuals, bolstered by scenic lighting and an <strong>adaptive soundtrack</strong>, provide an experience that requires attentiveness and quick reflexes. Its replayability and mechanical appeal extends off of its core gameplay and <strong>randomly-generated runs</strong>.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T11:57:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0e/d0eb4ea8eea1580638b17c3a9ef75b08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TerminalVelocityDevs"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
