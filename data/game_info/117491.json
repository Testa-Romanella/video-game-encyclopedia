{"id": 117491, "slug": "na-und", "name": "Na Und?", "name_original": "Na Und?", "description": "<p><em>Na Und?</em> is an experimental game of choice.\u00a0It explores themes of ethics, politics, morality, and the idea of self. As the player answers 55 of 200+ possible\u00a0questions, it indirectly and abstractly influences the game world. This mechanic gives players the opportunity to reflect on how their perspective can influence the world around them without praising nor condemning their beliefs.<br/></p>\n<p>The art style, inspired by the Surrealist movement, is meant to re-emphasize the theme of unrealities.</p>\n<p>This game was made during Art Games at the Goethe-Institut of Boston in 2017 and unites the game jam\u2019s themes of art, politics, and unrealities as a thought-provoking art piece. We have found this game especially insightful when played socially.</p>\n\n<strong>Team Member</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Primary Role</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Devin \u201cGrafton\u201d Brite<br/><br/>Untuned Pianist<br/>Julien Cherry<br/><br/>Mono-DeveloperJosh Dick<br/><br/>Technical Artist<br/>Hannah \u201cCat Lady\u201d Huddle<br/><br/>\u201cArt\u201d ArtistNoah Senzel<br/><br/>Pixel Pusher<br/>\n<p>https://www.goethe.de/artgames<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d7/0d70b46bb8712003f130111c171b4ebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["na-und-goethe-2017"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
