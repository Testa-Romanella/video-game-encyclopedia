You control a robot called the Basketballer. You can move Basketballer's position on the court as well as change the force and angle of the ball's trajectory. The 2 different games are: <br/><br/>Junkyard 21 - You control Basketballer and play against Pal, one of Anne's android creations. Pal is a kind opponent who always blames the ball, not the player, and gives generous praise when the ball goes in the basket. Just like on the courts, the first player to get 21 points wins. <br/><br/>Obstacle Mode - You still control Bastketballer, but now you can only control the force and angle of the ball. There are also outlandish obstacles that block the ball's way to the basket. If you can figure out how use the obstacles to your advantage, victory will be yours! <br/><br/>Three difficulty modes help new players build confidence and ramp up their skills.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T03:31:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2b9d55842d1d7a5fe7a2d6ce4970654.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sinking Ship Interactive"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Sinking Ship Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
