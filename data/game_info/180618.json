Will add dance pad support if we hit $5.</p>\n<p>Note - fixed the quit menu, pressing escape will now open an \"exit\" option which can be used by clicking on it. You can press escape again to close the menu.</p>\n<p>Note: Redux - The latest version (v3) contains royalty free audio, making it illegible for a game jam. The previous two versions however are completely original works. The latest version is the best current version for non-game-jam purposes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/8242ba691675eabc2a2277fa5c5225cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Woodcutter"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
