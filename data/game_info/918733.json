My portfolio of work served as the theme for the show, as it showcases my growth and development as an artist over the course of my studies. I chose to present the exhibition in Virtual Reality, as it is a technology that I find both fascinating and underutilized. To add a human element and maintain a sense of physicality, I also created a reduced scale physical model of the exhibition space. Overall, this project allowed me to demonstrate my skills in curation, modeling, and exhibition design in both virtual and physical realms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T12:29:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1b/e1b81a12cec80b16eae790caf548a772.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["JoaoNoronha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
