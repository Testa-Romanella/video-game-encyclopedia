Now, they see us as trash that needs to be removed.</p>\n<p>Life has turned into a frantic Prepare-and-fight cycle as the moon plummets once more towards the swarm of drones surrounding the once peaceful planet.</p>\n<p>That Red Zone will be the end of us all....</p>\n<p>ORBIDRONE is a survival, resource management, tower-defense game set in the future in a galaxy far, far away. Build and maintain your base. Recharge, repair, recondition or recycle your base parts, and prepare for the red zone because those drones are relentless, and your guns are probably not that good.</p>\n<p>Keep the shield up because once your habitat is destroyed, it's tickets...</p>\n<p>NOTE: ORBIDRONE is best played in full screen mode</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:25:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/872/8728def85708c6ea1e0d978e97726aaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bixarrio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
