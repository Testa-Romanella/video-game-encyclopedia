We know everything about them but toddlers still don't! This app is a great way for you to show and explain your babies everything!<br/><br/>There are helpers in the app named The Fixies, who will lead kids though the app with voice and sounds!<br/>Kids will learn:<br/>- What appliances are there in the kitchen and what do they do (your kid will see what the oven is needed for)<br/>- What sounds do the musical instruments make (and what do they look like!)<br/>- How to take care of pets (and what to feed a parrot with!)<br/>- What do we need the tools for (kids will be good at helping their dads with repairing afterwards)<br/><br/>After exploring children can play games and solidify their new knowledge!
