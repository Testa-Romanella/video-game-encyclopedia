You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard.\u00a0</p><p>You are in control of a green boat. You must navigate in the blue water while avoiding the grey terrain, and the adverse red boats. You can navigate by using the throttle/brake lever, and the direction knob. A horn is also provided.</p><p>Your boat is fitted with safety systems. An obstacle alert, visual and audible when you are pointing towards a terrain, a proximity alert when you are too close to an obstacle and an audible \"Traffic traffic\" like an airliner's TCAS to indicate that you, and another ship are crossing paths. Ships may horn at you if they see you.</p><p>Please note that this version is full of bugs. If you encounter any issue with the boat controls after restarting, please, refresh the web page.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b74b62609823100f305fd4636b44fc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LinkSkywalker200"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
