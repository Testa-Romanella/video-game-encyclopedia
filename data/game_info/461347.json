Expect a few more 8-Bit gamed from me in the future!\u00a0Go from tab to tab on your computer as you complete the task each page has for you. But what each tab has waiting for you is a mystery...</p>\n<p>To switch between tabs, move your avatar - or cursor - <em>next to</em> the blinking circle on the tab. Interacting with the\u00a0blinking circle will give you the name of the page.
