For the purpose of this game however, we designed the receiver to create an opening for the opponent to make the precise strike which is more in line of Uchikomi keiko. There are four targets. Men (top of the head), Tsuki (Thrust to the throat), Kote (Right wrist) and Do (sides of the torso). There are also combined attacks such as Kote-men (Wrist and head) and Kote-do (Wrist and sides of torso). The object of the game is to make an immediate and precise attack on wherever the receiver makes an opening to and the longer the streak, the higher your score will be. <br/>GameCenter leaderboard is supported. You can post your longest streak to facebook.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:21:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/038/03873558f979c7bcf62ff7606ddca86e_5i1Z9O6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["toltoly"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["won kim"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
