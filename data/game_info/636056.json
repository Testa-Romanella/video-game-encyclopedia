Now you can turn, and as points go up difficulty does too. Whether this means shrinking the players, adding obstacles, or speeding up the ball, depends entire on how many points the players have.</p>\n<p>Player 1 uses WASD and Player 2 uses Arrow Keys.</p>\n<p>UPDATE LOG:</p>\n<p>The character's initial sizes are smaller as is the ball.</p>\n<p>I changed the all movement to use Delta time.</p>\n<p>I slightly adjusted the audio leveling.</p>\n<p>I added a count down to the beginning to give more breath time and to experiment with the controls, which are shown during the count down.</p>\n<p>I changed the balls speed.</p>\n<p>I added color correlation to the points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T08:03:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf2/bf28f10289c3d0cc073f5840720b7dcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mechanic Gopher"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
