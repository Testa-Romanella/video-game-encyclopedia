It's also about stabbing particles and blocking particles. There are two Game Modes with challenge at every level. Fight fast to avoid getting overwhelmed in Endless Mode! Or go for the slow climb that builds in Levels Mode!</p><p> Simple game made as a challenge to myself, after doing a boatload of research on Gamemaker. Took about 3 months on and off. </p><p>Notes: listen to the rhythm of shots, every thing fires at regular intervals. However, the intervals vary between Gamemodes. Now with more intuitive controls! :)  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b31/b3111a4ebe3bd010af1daf3d4b948b7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheGenluck"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
