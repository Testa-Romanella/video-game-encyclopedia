The player throws balls to destroy brightly colored cubes and has a square shield to block rebounds. There are three levels and to clear them you break all cubes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first game. I chose a Breakout-style game because I figured I could handle the mechanics and thought it would be fun to turn a classic flat game into something more kinetic and physical.</p>\n<p>This game has not really been play-tested. I'm very interested in suggestions and feedback. Thanks for your interest and I hope you enjoy Bounce Box!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eae728eb766a40454cc11bb033368e44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Upstairs Interactive"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
