Extremely simple controls inspired by chess. Play the base game (arcade mode) for free and comment in the forums on Steam to voice your opinion on problems and suggestions.<br/><br/>Choose your Maniple and give it a single order: where to move. Attacks and abilities are automated, and each Maniple moves and attacks differently. All you need to do is right click.<br/><br/>Levels are randomly generated and populated with random combinations and positions of enemies. The game is set up to allow for quick matches.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the game, consider buying the story mode!
