The goal is to place numbers from zero to nine in the spaces to produce the correct total for each row and column, utilizing the mathematical operations shown.  <br/><br/>Mathoku is easy to learn and very addictive.  Since the app utilizes random numbers to generate each puzzle, the number of combinations is almost endless (over 2 million games per level).<br/><br/>Users have the ability to save scores and view reports of those scores.  Four more difficulty levels have been added to increase usability and enhance enjoyment of the game. <br/><br/>Created by a certified Math teacher, Mathoku can help sharpen a child\u2019s arithmetic and mathematical skills as well as stimulate the logical mathematical minds of young adults.  Fans of Sudoku, Twenty-four and Kenken will love it.  <br/><br/>There are now nine difficulty levels and the ability to ask for a hint when needed.  The mathematical rules of order of operations are reinforced with this app.<br/><br/>Challenge yourself today!<br/><br/>Please contact customer support at kairosco@aol.com with any questions or concerns.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/108f096fa69d512799134ef4a76c23f0_XWFhp70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kairos Development Co"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ruth Kartalis"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
