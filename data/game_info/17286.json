{"id": 17286, "slug": "eets-munchies", "name": "Eets Munchies", "name_original": "Eets Munchies", "description": "<p>Eets Munchies is a sequel to Eets and is defined by a cartoonish visual style, upbeat music, and whimsy humor. Its gameplay is reminiscent of Lemmings. The main character is Eets, a small funny beast that eats everything on his way. However, the player doesn&#39;t control Eets directly. The character will not obey the player and has to be manipulated in various ways. For example, the player may place Eets&#39;s favorite food where he or she wants the character to go. Certain items can also influence the beast&#39;s mood and make him behave in a different way. <br />\nAt the start of each level, the player puts his or her items on the map. After that, Eets is released to stumble all over the level, bounce off the obstacles, and get sad, happy or angry, depending on what he ate. Eets Munchies has three levels of speed that allow the difficulty to vary. Your main goal is to lead Eets through each maze towards its endpoint, which is marked by a huge cake hanging from the ceiling on a rope. Your game score, however, also depends on how many candies Eets will devour on his way, and to set a higher score is necessary to unlock new levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-24T05:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/904/904809185a905c430f6c36f0ebf5353c.jpg", "website": "http://www.eetsgame.com/", "rating": 2.26, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 109, "owned": 1578, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 39, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 81, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 81, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Family", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
