Smashy the 3rd gets trapped in a castle controlled by an evil necromancer. He must find a way out of this evil castle before he gets transformed into one of the castle minions.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game ever. I spent 3 months learning Unity and C# programming (with very little coding experience in the past). I used whatever free and very few paid assets from itch and unity asset store for art, music and sound effects. However almost all scripts were written by me either following the gist of tutorials or from whatever I could come up with.<br/></p>\n<p>I know the game is far from perfect and game design is hugely flawed. But its a first game and I'm really satisfied with how it turned out. I won't be adding any updates to this game, but I appreciate any feedback on game mechanics or game design yall have anyway. Hoping to make more games with more of my own art.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway hope yall have fun playing...even if only for the 10 minutes it takes to finish this game. :)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7b/a7b240c30e0dcb72b30d673fc14177fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Press_Space"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
