{"id": 138497, "slug": "redirect-gronx", "name": "Redirect (Gronx)", "name_original": "Redirect (Gronx)", "description": "<p>Redirect is a fast paced game where the player has the ability to dash, and redirect all of their momentum in a specified direction. The game takes place over a series of (currently 17, but work in progress) levels, each with varying features such as spikes, lasers, enemies, and wind zones. The player attempts to clear each of these levels as quickly as possible, and obtains one of 5 ranks. Gates bar the players progress, unless they have achieved high enough collective ranks on levels, unlocking the following zone. Redirect is currently in very early development, featuring only a fraction of the planned content, such as turrets firing at the player.</p>\n<p>For advice on specific levels, discussing routing, or suggestions/ideas, visit the\u00a0community discord.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea4/ea4b48cf8a8a561b52c21c371d12ab9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gronx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
