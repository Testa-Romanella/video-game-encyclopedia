{"id": 499956, "slug": "total-totem", "name": "Total Totem", "name_original": "Total Totem", "description": "<p>A 3D shooter game\u00a0implemented in the first S.E.C.U Jam, hosted by Wolf1333. The jam lasted a week \u00a0and had the theme\u00a0<strong>FIRST PERSON SHOOTER</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>Link of the jam:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/7-day-jamm</p>\r\nThe Idea Behind Total Totem\r\n<p>Total Totem joins a first person view with a third person view. The truth is I didn't really want to do a FPS game, so I experimented with the Third Person View. In the original idea, the player could also attack targets in third person view too, but we removed that because of the time.</p>\r\nImplementation\r\n<p>We had quite a problem with the implementation this time because of the team. Two or three days into the jam, the first team I had initially formed bailed out. I had to form another team in the meantime, so you could say we made that game in a couple of days.<br/><br/>Most problems we had definitely had to do with .unity files. They conflicted all the time. Also, 3D models. Since it's\u00a0 3D, takes a long time to model and animate each component we need for the game. What saved us was Mixamo. Thank you, Adobe.</p>\r\nFuture Ideas\r\n<p>Here are some ideas I had if I ever came back to this project:</p>\n<p>1 -\u00a0 Complete revamp of the targets. As you can see, the targets just float and are big, boring spheres. We should make the targets move around, maybe even attack the players. Give them a nice totem model, too.</p>\n<p>2 - Add many, many more levels, types of platforms and player abilities. Maybe make the player jump, attack, dodge, etc.</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>This section is dedicated to feedback.</p>\r\nCredits &amp; Links\r\n<p>Everyone did a\u00a0 little of everything, so I'm gonna credit everyone that participated. I don't want to risk being unfair.</p>\n<p>Me<br/></p>\n<p>caioreigot (https://itch.io/profile/caioreigot)</p>\n<p>RocketNate (https://itch.io/profile/rocketnate)</p>\n<p>bakosakura<br/></p>\n<p>MichaelElkan<br/></p>\n<p>Github of the project:\u00a0https://github.com/Dans1997/Total-Totem</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22b1a70d8f364e18b0dec86924bdf9fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Danillo Neves"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
