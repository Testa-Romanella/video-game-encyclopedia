It\u2019s just another wonderful day out with the kids in Think of the Children, a chaotic parenting simulator for up to four players. <br/><br/>Hauled before the court for bad parenting and endangering the lives of your children, the Prosecutors present a series of events as evidence that will either condemn or exonerate you: a birthday party at the park, a day at the zoo, a camping trip, an unexpected visit to the Australian Outback and more. Each of these locations proves to be far more dangerous than they sound, and even the tamest of environments are filled with deadly hazards. <br/><br/>Run solo, or team up with other parents locally and online, to play through each trip in flashback to prove your parenting skills-and your innocence-to the judge, and avoid going to jail. <br/><br/>Multi-tasking mayhemThere\u2019s never a dull moment when you\u2019ve got the BBQ to tend, picnic tables to set, some of the kids are playing with a rabid dog, and two of them just ran out onto the road.Parenting is hardTo get a good parenting grade and avoid jail time you\u2019ll need to get all your tasks done, keep the kids happy, and\u2013ideally\u2013alive!Nowhere is safeThe local park, the beach, the supermarket, the zoo. Great places for a day out with the kids. That is, aside from the poisonous berries, ravenous seagulls, towering grocery shelves and electrified pens.All kinds of families welcomeSingle parent? Two mums? A mum, two dads and a horse in a long distance relationship? It\u2019s all good. Parent solo or co-operatively with up to four players, locally or online.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-21T07:34:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37c/37cb3c7740f38ef84b4eedb122ac0872.jpg", "website": "http://thinkofthechildrengame.com", "rating": 2.36, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 384, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 7, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 110, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["SURPRISE ATTACK", "Jammed Up Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Fellow Traveller", "Surprise Attack"], "esrb_rating": null}
