I hope you enjoy your state.\u00a0But beware of disturbing the inhabitants in their holy looping activities. Unlooping will not be go unpunished...</p>\n<p>Village overview:</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The Holy L\u221ep Church:<br/></p>\n\n<p>Boss battle:</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the game is to complete the quests by finding the way to \"unloop\" some inhabitants in the village and get more items to be able to beat the boss that is controlling the whole world. Each time you complete a quest, a portal will spawn and the boss will request your presence in the arena. At the beginning it will be very hard or impossible to beat, but you will keep the items after dying, so that in the next loop you can complete another quest granting you another item and making the fight easier/possible. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately we weren't able to finish completely with the game (we broke more things than could fix ^^) but we hope you enjoy the art-style, sounds, idea and the things that do work :)</p>\n<p>Music/Sounds from our teammember: https://www.youtube.com/c/LeonVers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:56:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fc5a3edbdbfc31820d57adea3e32d9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Gloxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
