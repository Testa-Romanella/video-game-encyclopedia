At the beginning of the game, you can choose between two characters, which determines the music, graphics and color pallette of the puzzles going forward. So it's almost like two different games!.. just with the same puzzles.</p><p>I may come back to this and add more levels, I might expand it to a CNROM to give it a fancy title screen and ending graphics or who knows. I just figure right now it does everything I wanted it to do when I thought of it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T06:03:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b89f996e43876135c2915bb491d72ede.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rani Baker"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
