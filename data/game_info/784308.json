Thanks for checking out my game, \"Reefs Route\".</p>\n<p>This is the coursework I submitted for my Computer Graphics module during my MSc in Computer Games Technology. I implemented a lighting system (Daylight and Night Mode), instanced rendering of trees for the forest, time-trial gameplay, camera work using TNB frames, a realistic first person mode,\u00a0GLSL shader programming, FMOD audio and much more. It was created using OpenGL in C++, and without a game engine.\u00a0This game contains a\u00a0wacky race track by a farm in the middle of the woods, among other strange things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy! - Reefat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T10:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a3/7a37793b1dba097b6dd3854145356b14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["forevastill"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
