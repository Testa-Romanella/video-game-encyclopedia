{"id": 614404, "slug": "anutech-black-jack", "name": "Anutech BLack Jack", "name_original": "Anutech BLack Jack", "description": "<p>Powered by the Black Dawn game engine, Written in Cython (Python, C/C++) , I don't know blackjack at all, so I followed a pygame tutorial from Tim Ruscica (Thanks Tim!!!) aka techwithtim (check him out on youtube). I post this anutech blackjack simulator on windows O.S. to show I am just as skilled on windows programming as well as Linux (Linux is God, Windows is a woke snob's toilet paper, I curse bill gates for the crap that is the Windows operating system) . But overall just another tech demo from the black dawn game engine. You use the mouse to make bets. Click on the chips you want to bet, and you press space to hit, and tab to stay. Tested on Windows 10 32 bit. Let me know if there are any issues. I want this blackjack simulator to work for you. If not stylish, at least kill 30 minutes. Try to beat the dealer if you can. Or I don't know. As I said, I don't know how blackjack works, I just used my game engine and followed Tim's tutorial on creating a blackjack simulator. To play, just extract the zip file and run the \"anutech_fkn_black_jack.exe\" executable file. That's all. you can even add it as a start item, taskbar item, or a shortcut to the desktop. The executable file will be the one you run.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ce/7ce448f106bed8df6f0553a3851e5755.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anutech Technical Resources"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
