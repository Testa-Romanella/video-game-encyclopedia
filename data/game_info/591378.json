You do not directly control your ants but they will head towards the enemy when there is a viable route. Build your tunnels and make your way down to each enemy Queen.\r\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I was overly ambitious and while the game had a huge amount of potential, trying a range of new things really slowed me down. Either way I\u2019m proud of how some of the mechanics came out. Thanks for checking out my submission :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:03:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce1/ce1a5e5cbbac9ab0810e974f76ff54f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndigoIGW"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
