Personally I (zrnorth)\u00a0had never touched Blender before this jam and I learned an absolutely huge amount over the course of the weekend. I'm particularly proud of the zombies' walk cycle and how they stick their hands out to throttle the player when they see you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I like to compose original music for jam games\u00a0but we ran out of time.
