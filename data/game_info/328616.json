It went from maze solving to a rogue like game, with enemies, pickups and more.</p>\n<p>The goal is to find all 6 data chunks in each of the 6 levels, so you can progress and finally make it out.</p>\n<p>But be careful! You have two health bars. Energy and Stability.</p>\n<p>Energy is drained on movement and by using abilities. While stability is drained by enemies.</p>\n<p>If any of the two reaches zero, you lose.</p>\n<p>A similar game will come soon too, as I love the idea and want to build on it.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Movement can be done with arrow keys or WASD</p>\n<p>Return to main menu with ESC</p>\n<p>Abilities are phasing (SHIFT) and sprinting (CTRL)</p>\n<p>Volume can be changed with left or right movement (in main menu) and window size can be changed with numbers 1-4 in the main menu</p>\n\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Sound effects can be found here: SubspaceAudio - 512 Sound Effects (8-bit style)</p>\n<p>And the Ambient music can be found here: Maxstack - Endgame: Singularity</p>\n\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\n<p>Special thanks to my patrons, as they support me and allow me to make games!</p>\n<ul><li>arc</li><li>Pupper ^-^ (Ulvra)</li><li>Jenny Koda</li><li>Zac</li><li>Larissa Hanson</li></ul>\n<p>If you would like to have your name here and/or get other great perks, consider supporting me on my Patreon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/447/4477fc9fc351355615adfad27a9247a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Maxine Red"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
