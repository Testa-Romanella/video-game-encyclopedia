However, even within their society where everyone has a special power, future seeing is considered dangerous and advised against.</p>\n<p>Unable to be swayed, Seer finally gains permission to look into their own future, only to receive an unbelievable revelation. Not only have they left Abnormal society, they're married to someone they've never met before.</p>\n<p>With visions of happiness in their mind, Seer leaves everything behind and ventures to the part of the land fraction where those without magic live; Normal society.</p>\n<p>Seer is going to convince this stranger that they are meant to be together no matter what it takes, even if it means tagging along on an adventure.</p>\n<p>In only a few days Seer will learn just how far away that pleasant future is. </p>\n<p>\u269c<strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>-150,000 word script</p>\n<p>-3 future spouse options (one male, one female, one agender)</p>\n<p>-Choose pronouns (he, she, or they) and a 'Normal' name for Buffalo Seer</p>\n<p>-A variety of choices, all of which are worth choosing<br/></p>\n<p>-Light animation effects &amp; over 20 CG images</p>\n<p>-A fun alternate outfit mode DLC <br/><br/></p>\n<p>A Foretold Affair is a customizable story rather than a fully branching one. While the general plot points will stay much the same, the specific interactions and conversations will change constantly based on your choices.</p>\n<p>Warning: The game includes violence, blood (more than an insignificant amount), and some swearing. It may not be suitable for all ages. Player discretion is advised.  </p>\n<p>This game was created using the Ren'Py Engine</p>\n<p>\u269c<strong>Alt Outfit DLC:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>At one point the three future spouse options have to wear clothing different than their usual ones. Those outfits just so happen to be their underwear. With quality pieces like that, we couldn't help but give people the option to use them all the time. With this DLC you'll be able to freely swap back and forth between the normal and alt outfits at any time and control individually which of the three characters wear what. </p>\n<p>To unlock the feature simply purchase the DLC along with the game, extract the zip files for the game and DLC, and then add the DLC.rpy from the DLC zip to the 'game' folder from the A Foretold Affair zip.<br/></p>\n<p>Using alternate outfits will not change CG images or the script, only the character sprites will be altered. </p>\n<p>This DLC is totally non-essential. It's just to add a bit more fun to those who find this kind of thing amusing/appealing.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for giving this a look \u2764<br/></p>\n<p>And feel free to check out some of our other works:</p><p>Lake of Voices (Non-Commercial, Horror, Romance, GxB/G )</p><p>XOXO Droplets (Non-Commercial and Commercial Versions, Comedy, Romance, GxB)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcf/dcf3acc3eb271466d1af6e0fa649db05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GBPatch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
