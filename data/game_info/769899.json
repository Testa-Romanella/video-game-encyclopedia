To test the waters, so to speak.</p>\n\n<p>The Emperor himself tasked you to provide support to his yet another conquest campaign far away on the edge\u00a0of His galaxy. Build up the economic backbone to support his conquest by colonizing planets, constructing buildings, producing military space ships and warping them to the front line.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nCOLONIZE AND BUILD\r\n<p>Colonize the planets and create the backbone for your economy. Different planets are suitable for different purposes, have different buildings available and slots to build on.
