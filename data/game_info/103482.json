It extended beyond Ocarina of Time, though, and soon I started thinking about all the other games I played and what was hiding there, and even began making maps of imaginary \"debug areas\" that I invented for games like Bomberman 64 and Quest. At the peak of all this I was having dreams about similar themes, and one of my favorites was about some supposed \"beta\" version of Big Boo's Mansion where it was just a big dead field with unfinished houses littering the grounds. I was looking for a book but this big round ghost-thing just kept following me. It didn't really do anything beyond that- always just watching. The imagery of that dream has stuck with me and although I don't remember a huge amount other than a few details and a general aesthetic, it's been enough to inspire strange feelings about darkness. This game isn't just based on that dream, but is instead a mixture of places and feelings that go well with the general idea in my mind.</em><em>\"</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e7737d6ef1d18bcec94c8030684f325d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lilith Zone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
