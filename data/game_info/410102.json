So I slapped this together in like 2.5 days using some existing tools I made previously.<br/></p>\n<p>A bit rough around the edges but I think it has some fun moments.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Make sure</em></strong> to read the controls because it's very convoluted.<br/>It's even more jank than OG Trespasser, if you can believe that.</p>\n<p>Not super podcast inspired but I wanted to make a game with the vibes from when Nick streamed Jurassic Park Trespasser, basically had this goofy physics player controller already so it seemed right.<br/>Stumbled on the name Trespunker before even starting the game when trying to title my project, just went with it and now its cyberpunk themed or something. Tres-punk-er.</p>\n<p>It's worth explorin' around a bit because there are 3 somewhat hidden special weapons to find.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br/>Controls of Note:<br/>R: pickup/drop items<br/>Hold E: move hand laterally<br/>Hold F: move hand in/out<br/>Hold Q: Rotate hand<br/>LMB: Shoot<br/>RMB: Interact with purple icon stuff</p>\n<p>Its not recommended to use the left hand but you can by holding ALT<br/>Use both hands by holding CTRL</p>\n<p>Look down for heart bar<br/></p>\n<p>Dino model/animations and\u00a0combat music are by my friend, Richa</p>\n<p>Didn't have time to change some stuff, like player model or UI textures.
