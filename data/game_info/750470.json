Step into the working man's boots of Crossing Guard Joe as he battles the combined forces of angry motorists and bureaucratic red tape.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>The gameplay requires hands-on action and quick thinking. The drivers of Monoxide City have no respect for traffic laws, pedestrians, common decency, or YOU. They won't stop for anything so you'll need to be quick on your feet and able to make snap-decisions to safely guide all the kids across the street.<br/><br/></li><li>5 days a week for 5 weeks. As you progress through the 25 LEVEL CAMPAIGN you will face ever-worsening traffic conditions and environmental hazards. You start the game off with nothing but your trusty stop-sign and your pointing-arm, but as you progress you might find helpful objects, like barriers and traffic lights.<br/><br/></li><li>Your score is determined by speed, crossing-combos, and of course how many kids you manage to get across the street. Refine your strategy for each level for better scores and reach for the top spot on the ONLINE LEADERBOARDS.<br/><br/></li><li>Test the limits of your crossing guard skills in the CHALLENGE MODE!</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Good luck out there, Joe.
