Plot your trajectory to pass as close to each target as possible (without crashing!) to achieve the perfect flyby. Scan for enough data and earn a Golden Record and a spectacular replay of the route your probe actually flew.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>But that's just the beginning. Use gravity to bend your path and rendezvous with impossibly distant planets. Pilot landers to touch the surface of alien worlds. Carefully manage \u2206v (delta-v) to inject satellites into orbit and build out a deep space network of relays. And find a way to beam your findings home before they're lost forever in the depths of outer space.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Crash. Burn. Adapt. Learn. Master real principles of orbital mechanics and explore our cosmic neighborhood in the greatest scientific mission of all time: Voyager 2!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T03:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b71/b71960fbeda2b8250fbdb22e026c53c4.jpg", "website": "https://rumorgames.com/voyager2/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rumor Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rumor Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
