If the mouse is still borked, please try the windows version if you are able and willing to.\u00a0If you are rating\u00a0for\u00a0LD50,\u00a0please note that some mouse code\u00a0was\u00a0changed post-deadline to attempt to\u00a0fix the\u00a0WebGL\u00a0mouse restriction issues.\r\n<p>This is my entry to LD50. Help out Gramps in what seems to be the final minutes of his life while in the hospital. Use WASD + mouse to walk and look around. E and F are contextually used for interacting and grabbing. Tab shows your inventory (empty at first) and allows you to equip things to your hands. You can use those with the mouse buttons once equipped. Dialogue choices are done with the number keys, or spacebar if no option is available.<br/></p>\n<p>For more information, please visit the LD page. Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T04:37:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c4/2c422920ad91a098e8e47e84d1e7676d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Frib"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
