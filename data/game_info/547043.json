In short, you may only transition between sea (blue) and land (green) via a beach.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to collect all the wood tiles on the map as quickly as possible. Keep playing and try to beat your own record!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T06:58:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbdf5dbb6b790dea91e774a4e555b519.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marky_mark"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
