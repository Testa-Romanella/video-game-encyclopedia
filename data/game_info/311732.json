Compared with hardcore players, it is more inclined to casual games.<br/>\r\nThe game draws more on Luftrausers, Bit Blaster XL, and Cycle28.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeveloper note:<br/>\r\nAfter developing the first indie game, I received many reviews and pointers from connoisseurs, which have greatly reused my development. I played a lot of similar games before I did this game, but I found that because the players don't know where they are, they often get confused. So in this game I added a small radar map to try to improve the player's control of the game. I am currently developing another game that uses some of the techniques in this game. If you have played my game, I hope you point out the shortcomings in the game and provide suggestions, which will be modified in the next version. I hope you like my game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/627/627afd4e324bb6ceb3feaa9e9f80c8fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AHui.Game"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AHui.Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
