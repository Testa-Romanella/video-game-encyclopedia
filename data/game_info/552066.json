In a simple black and white aesthetic (mostly ;) ) your character must maneuver through a strange dungeon killing enemies with his trustee death gun. Arcade and platformer fans alike will love this short adventure game!<br/><br/>Everything in the music was made by the team Credits go to myself for doing gameplay, art coding, and concepts. Music and sound effects from Simon Ellerbe. I'm not incredibly happy about how it came out because there's still much that needs working on, but for a short game jam game, I'm happy I spent the time working on it. Post jam version coming soon?<br/><br/>Make sure to rate if you're in the jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97f/97faf2c6be8f6c31c5843b382dbfdb7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Porter Orvetti"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
