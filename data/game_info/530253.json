When the game is run it allows the user to draw using different shaped objects and color variations. The user can alter object features such as size, glow and opacity. The user can also control animations that the objects perform, along with the speed of each animation. The animation options are stretch, rotate, and bounce. The objects spawned and animations performed can be randomized, and toggled on and off. The objects are automatically destroyed after 3 seconds, or at time specified by the user using a slider. The destroy setting can also be toggled off, or the user can destroy themselves by right-clicking on spawned objects. A clock displays the user's console time and can be toggled between AM/PM, with the game environment simulating a scene for that time of day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:55:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6b/f6b111d81536e22bef06acb00ae8b2b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kayligbrower"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
