Do some strolling, climbing and swimming.\u00a0 Best enjoyed with friends!<br/></p>\n<p>Know what you're buying: this is not a game, it's just a place you can go to. I've called it a walkingsimulator in the past. It's filled with art I've made, structures you can climb and an ocean you can swim in.</p>\n<p>Maybe you go there and are like: I wish there was more to do!\u00a0In that case: congrats! You have balanced work and play in your life in a way that you wouldn't mind having to do\u00a0more :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>I really want to ask you to not go alone. Convince a friend to download it as well, use the same roomcode, and meetup in Maranga and just explore.</p>\n<p>I'm also in the business of giving tours (of at least 5 people) where I go into how I created Maranga and you can ask me what you want. DM me on twitter: @durkatwork\u00a0or email me at durkvandermeer@gmail.com if you're interested.</p>\n<p>Maranga got two honourable mentions at the raindance immersive festival by the way.</p><p>Maranga was made by:</p><p>Durk van der Meer (@durkatwork)\u00a0</p><p>and</p><p>Daniel Beauchamp (@pushmatrix)</p>\n<p><em>Maranga is a sprawling, whimsical and inspiring world </em>Someone said<br/></p>\n<p><em>This is one of the very best VR experiences I've had in years. It was larger and more interactive than I imagined it would be. There are a lot of hidden gems in this environment. I highly recommend this as a delightful relaxing escape from reality. Take full advantage of the multiplayer and bring friends. They'll thank you!</em><em> </em>According to some other dude</p>\n<p><em>Simply incredible! So happy to tour it and see amazing artwork tell a story in such a beautiful intricate world!</em><em> </em>Also a real comment</p>\n<p><em>Excellent experience. Great visuals and audio. Fun to explore. Very enjoyable.</em> This is actually me saying this.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T07:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/149430085ba522d8f1710ea5e8c1aea1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 373, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["durk van der meer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
