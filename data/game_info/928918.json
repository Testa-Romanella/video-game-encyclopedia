{"id": 928918, "slug": "coin-drop", "name": "Coin Drop", "name_original": "Coin Drop", "description": "<p><strong>Coin Drop</strong> is an arcade turn-based puzzle strategy\u00a0game, inspired by one of Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates' mini games: Treasure Drop.</p>\n<p>The original game only had coins and was exclusively two player versus, but here we added\u00a0some twists to spice things up... and a single player mode!</p>\n<p>In the board you can find:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>Coins</strong>: gives you points when it falls into a score slot. Can combine with another coin in the air to multiply its value.</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Bombs</strong>: destroys coins and power ups when falling. It's timer ticks whenever it touches a switch head, and explodes after 3 ticks (or when a round ends). It's explosion can destroy a switch or a score slot.</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Coin bags</strong>: spawns\u00a0coins in 5 random slots.</li><li> <strong>Extra coins</strong>: gives you 3 more coins for this round (single player only).</li><li><strong>Switches</strong>: holds coins and bombs in the upper part, rotates when something touches the bottom part.</li></ul>\n<p>Get as many points as you can, while reaching the required score each round to pass to the next one. Score slots values will change every round.</p>\n<p>Deciding whether a bomb destroys a switch or a score slot is up to you... kind of?</p>\n\n<p>Android native version coming soon!</p>\n<p><em>Fonts used:\u00a0Alkhemikal\u00a0by jeti &amp; tinypixel\u00a0by\u00a0videodante</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T06:10:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b06f6be6087b20405676bb832648723e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Toast it"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
