In this dissertation we explore Derrida\u2019s theory of hauntology and its applications\u00a0in archaeology. Drawing upon various case-studies, we discover that ghosts can be\u00a0identified through mixed approaches \u2013 excavation, memory, material traces and walking.\u00a0We then propose to merge these enactments into a radical methodology of hauntology,\u00a0choosing the Saracen Foundry as our site of inquiry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game represents phenomenology, audio, walking and\u00a0non-linearity are practiced and then transcribed into an audio-visual environment in\u00a0Twine, a creative-narrative engine. The final result is a fully-realized phenomenological\u00a0user-interface, wherein persons can navigate between related Saracen Foundry sites, and\u00a0conjure up revenants for their own speculation.</p>\n<p>Submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MA with Honours in Archaeology at the University of Glasgow 2016.\u00a0<strong>If you want to learn more, feel free to contact me at developer@rorypeace.co.uk!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/613/613e5b78211530ed94eaff211f1ecbec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["rorypeace"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
