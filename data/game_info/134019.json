I made it for the Indie Game Maker Contest in one month during the 2015 summer.<br/>\r\n\tI'm sorry for the long loading screens between levels. Hope you will enjoy the game.<br/>\r\n\tDavid</em><br/></p>\r\n\tPitch :\r\n<p>\r\n\tA Tree On Mars is a 20-30mn game about a little flying robot growing a tree on the red planet. Each time you finish a level the Tree will grow.\r\n</p>Gameplay :<p>\r\n\tA Tree On Mars has a 2D gameplay in a 3D world. I tried to make a game without any text or tutorials, by making a level design that teaches the player the game mechanics. Your character is a little flying robot that can move up/down and right/left. You can push physical objects that are used to solve puzzles. You must avoid obstacles like lasers are sand bursts, play with elevators and push a lot of rocks. You have to explore the levels and at each level end, you unlock water for the Tree and a new level. It allowed me to create the game without knowing the exact number of levels I had to design.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38cb34e02a996f8907ef3e41a465aa38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Birg\u00e9-Cotte"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
