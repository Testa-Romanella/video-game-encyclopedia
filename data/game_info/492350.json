Some nice atmosphere, but not the same in colour.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Having a clear out in the Darkling Room, which meant looking through a few old drives.\u00a0Rediscovered this\u00a0demo for a \u2018horror\u2019 instalment of the Crown games on an old drive.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>I found an old tech demo from around 2008, for a 3D set version of The Lost Crown games. The\u00a0demo was built a loooong time ago, somewhere between The Lost Crown and Dark Fall : Lost Souls. Download it now if you fancy trying it out.</p>\n<p>The idea was to build 3D sets, more of an old RE style for the Crown games. The script was good, and eventually morphed into Ghost Vigil.</p>\n<p>The 'Life Leech' makes it first appearance, unsurprising given the presence of the Dark Fall. The location is an old Boys School, ready for an investigation by Lucy and Nigel. The idea was to swap live, between the characters, hence the strange movements for Nigel in this demo. <br/><br/>Instructions!</p>\n<p>F1 to Quit</p>\n<p>Click floor space to MOVE Nigel, and click arrows to change cameras. Nigel doesn't have to be in the scene to interact, as the idea was to use either character.</p>\n<p>Click 'Play in a Window from Settings.exe for Widescreens. It's an OLD demo.</p>\n<p>There's two puzzles, if you can find them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:18:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd3c4126dd079bc35fcf761abb02677f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Darkling Room"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
