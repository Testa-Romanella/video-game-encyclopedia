Together you'll explore her soul-space, discovering more about her, the relationships she had with your party members, and even the man who killed her.\u00a0All of this will be taking place from the view point of your trio, quite a ways into an ongoing adventure.\u00a0<br/><br/>For Lily is an RPG made using RPG\u00a0Maker XP. It was originally intended to be part of a 24 hour self-imposed development challenge, but it was too fun to stop so soon.\u00a0Consequently, the game has gotten a lot more polish and content.\u00a0For Lily may be updated with patches and bug fixes in the future, if anything arises.<br/><br/>This game was made to be free, and you should never have to pay money for it. However, if you have interest in donations, do so only of your own accord!\u00a0It was made out of love, not greed.<br/><br/><br/>Compatibility:<br/>RPG\u00a0Maker XP made games are typically\u00a0compatible with most Windows\u00a0OS. For Lily has been tested on\u00a0XP and Win10. RPG Maker XP doesn't support MAC OS to my knowledge.\u00a0If you have compatibility issues, bugs, or any problems I encourage commenting them and the game might get a patch, depending.<br/><br/>Credits: <br/>Shawn Cooper, The Assistant\u00a0Mutation, and several victims\u00a0(Unpaid QA Testing friends).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T05:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb241c605b6846705616c5e81c50f99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shawn Cooper"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
