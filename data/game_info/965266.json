Felipe after suffering a great personal loss. What makes us human when we struggle daily to survive?<br/><br/>The name of the virus that caused everything is called Nerphus , based on a real virus that turns pigeons into zombies, there was a recent case of this virus, it happened on the island of Jersey, where several birds of a flock had to be sacrificed due to a 'disease invariably fatal virus'. The 'disease that turns pigeons into zombies' is called Newcastle disease, caused by a pigeon paramyxovirus (PPMV), which has no treatment. so I'm based on the characteristics of this virus and its variants, to implement in the game only for different individuals in the case of people etc, many reactions will be specific to each individual, there will be 3 categories of zombies each with different reactions, a milder one , a more aggressive one, and the last one in addition to aggressiveness and dexterity, will have something that makes him special, he is in a more advanced state, in a brief moment he stops being a zombie and his human side comes to the surface, then he begins to having memories of small fragments of the past with someone very special, an important moment, so after these minutes he returns to his aggressive zombie state attacking whoever is ahead<br/><br/>INCLUDES<br/>\u2022 New Game +<br/>\u2022 Survival Mode<br/>\u2022 Challenge Mode<br/>\u2022 I'm planning to add more elements and new mechanics that are still missing like stealth systems, different bosses, different zombies category total category will be 3, a type of zombie in the initial contamination phase, less aggressive, more harmless in the attacks and slower, another more aggressive and with a slightly more advanced phase of the virus, this one already has more agility and dexterity, and the last one, a type of zombie, which counts aggressiveness, dexterity, agility, in addition to this zombie being very special, it is in a state advanced that no one can explain, in a brief moment this category of zombie ceases to be a zombie and its human side comes to light, which awakens along with small fragments of memories of the past, so it starts in that brief moment to act like a normal human, and after a few minutes it returns to its brutal zombie state again attacking whoever is ahead, I'm building the city of goi\u00e2nia so, I'm implementing the expansion of the map little by little, multiplayer mode is already in progress and practically ready, in addition to graphical and technical improvements.
