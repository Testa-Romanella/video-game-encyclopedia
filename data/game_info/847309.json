You are tasked with retrieving a valuable AI and prototype blueprint of a mech walker being built by an enemy operation. You will be given the ability to sneak and crawl to avoid detection while also taking out enemies that may be in your path. Along with this, you have a cybernetic arm equipped with a sonic transmitter which can be fired and attached to a wall. While attached, the transmitter will reveal the environment in that area for the player as well as give the player to detonate the transmitter and disable any enemies in the vicinity. However, you must use these transmitters sparingly as you are only equipped with a specific amount and will need to resupply as you find them in the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T13:59:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11e/11e00b6bfa4c0b05c072c2c8e603154b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrownBagStudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
