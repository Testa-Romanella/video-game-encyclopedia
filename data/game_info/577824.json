You as a player will build your level from premade, but randomly selected rooms. Each room has a difficulty setting that will help you to determine what rooms to place. The catch is in that. The more difficult rooms you'll build the more score potential you have. You can go all in and get all the points or go safe, but earn less points. The choice is yours!</p>\n\n<p>Also you have limited lives for the whole game ;)</p>\n\n<p>Developers:</p>\n<p>Programmers:</p>\n<p>@HidekiRoz @Moxidus</p>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<p>@Ashikoo</p>\n\n<p>Legal:</p>\n<p>Soundtracks by Jim Hall\u00a0CC BY</p>\n<p>Font by\u00a0by\u00a0Daniel Linssen</p>\n<p>Developers Note:</p>\n<p>This is our first game jam and our first game we ever \"finished\". It was really fun to do this even though, we were stressed out if we would even finish this project. Everyone in the team had fun and learned one or two things here and there. We hope you will enjoy our game and leave some feedback for us, thank you. ^^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T10:47:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c6511dc67a20203a3fca973ae8a0d7b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["HidekiRoz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
