I wanted to try replicating the temporal and positional strategy of a traditional roguelike but without using a grid. As the abilities and enemies were added and tutorialised, the game turned more into a puzzle game than a turn based combat game.</p>\n<p>Still, I am very proud of this entry. Its fun to play and the main loop feels good.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming Design: Ben Buckton</p>\n<p>Graphics: Tom Mason (@wheybags)</p>\n<p>SFX and Music: @substain<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T07:58:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a94/a946ba8aa09797d9981ec2b0dc471a9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["abregado"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
