In this zombie survival game you will meet waves of zombies. Completing each wave will gain you resources to acquire zombie weapons in order to defeat the zombies.<br/>\r\nYou start the game with a powerful fire axe that has epic power attack capabilities. You can choose to become an expert axe wielder and complete all zombie waves and levels with just the axe. Or you can open the chests you collect during game play to acquire weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is currently a mobile title available on Android and IOS. The current controller and gameplay format does not suit itself to PC and Console. We therefore are going to port the game to PC and XBox and completely adapt the controller scheme from a single stick to dual stick controller scheme. We will also remove the mobile elements such as reward chests and replace them with gameplay elements that suit the non mobile platforms better.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T11:06:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1b/e1b46d5f07082649db26e637024adfba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["528 Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["528 Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
