You play as the Cosmic Kitten, a being created to restart the dormant portals connecting the galaxy together. The demo consists of 20 levels from the first world, so the platforming is pretty basic for now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The full game is currently in development, and I plan to update this demo a few more times as it gets closer to\u00a0completion. The full game is planned to have five worlds, with a bonus challenge world unlocked after finishing the game for the first time. I\u00a0hope you all enjoy the demo!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1c/a1c1dd2d2523f2277e51f6390e79bdb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["sleepyvampiregames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
