Set in the fictional post apocalyptic world, the player controls a lone survivor fighting for his life against the undead. <strong>This is a gameplay prototype and not the final game.</strong> In this prototype you will be fighting against endless hordes of various undead monsters to fight your way up the live leaderboards. You will be able to pick up many different types of weapons with different stats and rarity levels. There is a playstyle for everyone. The final released game in Halloween 2022 will have many more features that are typical to the action rpg genre like throwables, consumables, skill trees, stat modifications, inventory systems, quests, npcs, etc. This prototype is completely free but donations to support the future development of this project are welcome. As well as any comments or suggestions for the game you would like to see implemented. Thank you for playing my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:23:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b69/b69175439c1a154a83372bce04991303.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zmarvin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
