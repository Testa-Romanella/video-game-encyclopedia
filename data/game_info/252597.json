{"id": 252597, "slug": "casual-croquet", "name": "Casual Croquet", "name_original": "Casual Croquet", "description": "The classic backyard game known as croquet.  Two players take turns hitting their ball through a series of hoops aka 'wickets'.  Making a shot results in an extra turn.  The first to hit the peg at the end after passing through all the wickets is the winner. <br/><br/>Controls: <br/>Press on the ball to display the croquet mallet. Drag away from the ball to determine the strength and direction of the stroke. Release hold to swing mallet and hit ball. Double tap to toggle zoom. <br/><br/>Tips:<br/>Where you tap on the ball is a factor in your stroke. Hitting the side of the ball will result in more spin, which can be useful in a difficult shot but is less predictable. Also, the two balls can hit each other so it is possible to knock your opponent away or block their shot with positioning.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e4b54d3787b47b9f771e73175d8e66.jpg", "website": "http://www.fallingninja.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Evan Godfrey"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Evan Godfrey"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
