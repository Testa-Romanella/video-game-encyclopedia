I wanted to combine this mechanic from my previous Seiga game with the platforming from my Chimata game. The result is an incredibly acrobatic Seiga that not only phases through walls at high speed, but also clings to them and can wall-jump all day. <br/>I wish I could become one with the walls, too: It's probably nice and cozy in there... (it's my second game jam in a row, please send help.)\r\n<p>Seek the mountain hermitage using the ability to pass through walls to avoid enemies and obstacles. A short platforming game with quick, non-stop action. <br/>A Touhou Project fan game, featuring a young Seiga Kaku who has just feigned her death to escape from her mundane life and seek the mountain hermitage. Before she can become the Immortal hermit who passes through walls, she needs to master her abilities. Each level has an optional collectable - can you gather them all?<br/></p>\r\nBasic controls\r\n<ul><li>Left, Right: Move</li><li>Z: Jump</li><li>X: Pass through walls</li></ul>\r\nSee possibilities where others see walls\r\n<p>Help Seiga become one with her nature as a hermit who passes through walls.</p>\n<ul><li>Press towards a wall mid-air to cling to it</li><li>Press 'Z' to jump off a wall you cling to</li><li>Press 'X' to pass through a wall you cling to or press up against</li><li>Phasing through walls increases your speed and maximum speed.
