One of them is the policy of death and violence that the government inflicts on the people.<br/><br/>Here is where Aparecida, a 27-year-old mechanic finds herself, waiting to go back home when her favela has been the target of a police operation and wants to know if her girlfriend Yara is alive.<br/><br/>Hybrid Rainbow is over six thousand words long, contains two endings, and is overall a bittersweet story about living with violence and what to want from your life. It is also a game aimed at adults, Hybrid Rainbow has mentions of sexual intercourse, transphobia, mental health issues, and it is set in a dystopia based on real-life Rio de Janeiro.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T20:06:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af7/af7ccb564aabeda5a478aed0b2b82d5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TangledVirus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
