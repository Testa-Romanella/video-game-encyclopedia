The construction job has gone awry, and the timelines have started splitting again. It's time to call in OXO to repair the damage before it's too late.</p>\n<p>Game created by:\u00a0Alex Benson, Jake Card, and Jessica Card</p>\n<p>Art, Animation &amp; Music by: Alex Benson</p>\n<p>Game Design by: Jake Card and Jessica Card</p>\n<p>Programming by: Jake Card and Jessica Card</p>\n<p>Created for the Portland Indie Gaming Squad June 2020 Slow Jam Game Jam.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Technical theme:\u00a0Turn-Based</li><li>Creative theme: Alternate Timeline</li></ul>\n<p><strong>RULES</strong></p>\n<p>The timelines are collapsing into each other! You're OXO, and it's your job to keep your timeline mostly intact until your vehicle charges and finishes the job for you.</p>\n<p>You lose if:<br/>* 50% of the grid falls into the alternate timelines.<br/>* You step into the alternate timelines.</p>\n<p>You win if:<br/>* You survive 25 turns without losing.<br/>* You fix all the cells with timeline damage.</p>\n<p>Your tools:<br/>These are the tools at your disposal. You only have B action points every turn, so choose wisely!</p>\n<p>* Move (1-5 AP): Move to the selected cell (no diagonals). Each cell costs 1 action point.<br/>* Melee fix (2 AP): Fix all the cells adjacent to you (including diagonals).<br/>* Ranged fix (1 AP): Fix a single cell of your choice.<br/>* Bomb (1 AP): Leave a bomb on the selected cell. If the alternate timelines hit the bomb, its cell and all its adjacent cells get fixed (including diagonals).</p>\n<p>How the alternate timelines work:<br/>Every turn, the alternate timeline \"heads\" move to a new cell and consume it. Every 3 turns, each head splits into two. Watch out for exponential growth!</p>\n<p>Hit Escape to quit.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T08:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/578/578914a169c54ea8e4da46cbb45435df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["beeskneesgames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
