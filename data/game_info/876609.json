You will have to make your way past many obstacles to get there. These obstacles are mostly cameras, and if you go in there light, the alarm will sound, and you will instantly lose, making the mission a failure. Thankfully, your boss has helped you by giving you a small map so you can know your location.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press M to use the map</p>\n<p>Press E to open the chest and get the diamond when you are near it</p>\n<p>arrow keys/wasd to move</p>\n<p>I really liked making this, so I think I might add more enemies and a larger thing to steal from. Also, I know it's pretty bad and short, so yeah. The theme correlation is really weak, its basically just having to wait for the cameras/enemies to be in the right position so that you can move past them.</p>\n<p>PLEASE RATE THIS - this was made in 2:55 minutes for Trijam #193</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T04:54:46", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Knight-fall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
