You see, the harvester has the seeds from the headless horseman's head. He uses these seeds to grow monster pumpkins if he forgets to harvest them on time, or regular pumpkins if he remembers. An exception to this would of course be the baby crawlers appearing on later nights, but forget I said anything about that.</p>\n<p>This game was made for my very first time doing a game jam, the Mini Jam 89: Pumpkin. Hopefully whoever you are playing this game, you'll enjoy it!!</p><p>My apologies as well for the temporary programmer art, my artist is currently working to replace it with something less horrifying.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A/D - to move left and right.</p>\n<p>Left click - to fire your shotgun spraying three seeds to either hurt enemy pumpkin monsters or to plant more seeds.</p>\n<p>Right click - to harvest normal pumpkins. Make sure not to harvest them early or you'll get nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Creative inspiration - thanks to NoahW, JubNib, and ChunkySoup, for helping me brainstorm some parts of this game.</p>\n<p>Art\u00a0- thanks to Matt Brown who is working to redo all the art in the game and for making the cover screen for the game.</p><p>Music - the music from this game was generated by ecrett music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T10:02:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e7/7e707abe693a60c12536bee3afceb943.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["underdoghero1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
