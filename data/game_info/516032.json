Your\u00a0<strong>Habitat Domes</strong>\u00a0will grow as shuttles make deliveries, so do the best you can to protect them!</p>\n<p>There is one resource -\u00a0<strong>Energy</strong>\u00a0- which is produced by the domes and used by the defense installations, firing missiles, building, and repairing. If you run out of energy or all your buildings are destroyed, your colony is lost.</p>\n<p>Build new domes to expand production faster and more installations to have more firepower. Raise your colony's status from an\u00a0<strong>Ordinary Outpost</strong>\u00a0to a\u00a0<strong>Sparkling Spacetropolis</strong>, defeat THE BOSS, and you win!</p>\n<p>Originally made for GM48, a GameMaker focused\u00a0jam.\u00a0This is basically still a prototype, although it has been polished up a bit from the jam entry already.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e26/e265c8bcf8e15a296f2a8bab3b1fa23d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kris24"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
