Each sector has been isolated from each other and resources are becoming scarce. Your sibling hasn't stopped crying for the past three days, since you've ran out of milk. Your mom sends you out to find some.</p>\n<p>Ceres Rising is a sci-fi RPG set on the dwarf planet of the same name. Made with GB-Studio, the game evokes nostalgia of a time of supposed general prosperity to discuss issues of inequality and state sponsored suppression.</p>\n<p>This build is basically the prologue to the game proper, with several possible win conditions. Not sure how long it may take to expand to a full game, but I'll post updates as I get stuff done.<br/></p>\n<p>If you would like to support the project and others we have the in the works, please check out our Patreon or consider a donation when accessing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you and hope you enjoy :)</p>\n<p>-Tom, Carpe Noctem Studios</p>\n\n<p>Special Acknowledgment and thanks to:<br/></p>\n<p>isaiah658 - sprite pack</p>\n<p>Chris Maltby - GB-Studio<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T06:04:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbceaddc84beb6328f71fda3615e4599.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Meket"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
