The way it relates to \"Adapt\" is that the player must quickly adapt their own playstyle when playing the game, as some microgames require the mouse pointer. Some will use keyboard controls.</p>\n<p>The 8 included microgames will cycle randomly until the player has successfully completed 100 of them\u00a0without failing. All assets, code and premise were created by myself and thus it does look the way it does.</p>\n<p>The game was developed using the Godot game engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T05:43:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e5/1e5203fe758bfef1ea2824d4c852ad72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["N-Jima"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
