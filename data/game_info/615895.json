Players will get to meet mythological figures such as the Spirit Wardens, the Ox-head and Horse-face Guardians of the Beyond, and the Tudi Gong (Keeper of the Land).<br />\nThe player takes on the role of Qi Yun, a &quot;rewinder&quot; who has the ability to enter people&#39;s memories and influence their actions. By utilizing &quot;senses&quot; and swaying others&#39; &quot;intentions&quot;, he can change history.<br />\nAt the request of the Spirit Wardens, Qi Yun goes to a small village to investigate why a spirit couldn&#39;t be reincarnated. The once thriving village has been deserted and filled with resentful spirits, leaving one woman alone in the teahouse. Who&#39;s she waiting for? Where did all the other villagers go? What really happened seven years ago?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-14T09:16:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07b/07b87932c4bc2ce1c9d5957e91fcb3c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 392, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MistyMountainStudio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Gamera Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
