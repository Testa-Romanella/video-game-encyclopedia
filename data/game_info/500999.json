Stand up early, eat your bagels and roll your dough!</p>\n<p>The game was inspired by some unrelated bagel making during the theme announcement. So it was a perfect fit, if i may be so superstitious! I used phaser.js as a framework and the game is controlled only by mouse.</p>\n<p>This time, i finished right in time, but of coursse I had to drop some features i originally wanted to have. Like getting a promotion at the bagel factory from rolling to packing until you eventually get to be the CEO of the corporation. Although i started with sound in mind, because the alarmclock was the first thing i coded, it was the only sound that remained in the game, as i couldnt fit all the sounds i wanted in time into the game.</p>\n<p>Have fun and thx for the feedback in advcance :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:35:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fd/3fd22cf6ae7fa07aa4a53b35b3b1fe31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ancientpixel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
