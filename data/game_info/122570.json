Some are at peace with the void, some look forward to their preferred afterlife, some crumble under the overwhelming existential dread of their inescapable end, but it's hard to really get to the heart of those feelings without actually being there.</p><p>Ajooni, despite her best efforts (or perhaps because of them), is there. In a strange, quiet forest, with the help of Death and an assortment of fellow former corpses, she will uncover probably more than she wants to about the residents, and herself, as she finds a way out through acceptance or defiance.</p><p>This is an extended demo, covering around the first third of the game. If you enjoy this, look forward to the full game some time next year.</p><p><strong>NICK CLINKSCALES    |    </strong><strong>LIZ BOREN</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b77/b77b99119e1e2b48090d26cdc283e3e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Synset Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
