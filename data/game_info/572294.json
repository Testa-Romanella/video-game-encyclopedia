Theme: <em><strong>Triangles</strong>... made in less than three hours<br/></em></p>\n<p>Our use of the theme is, <em>ehem</em>, 'subtle and understated': The sprites are made up of triangles, the music is made with triangle waves, the sounds of the explosions and the firing of weapons are names of triangles, and there is a chant of triangle varieties running in the background with a triangle-wave drone under the chant. The font is also composed of triangles, but we didn't make that (cited below the software listing).</p>\n<p><strong>Use arrow keys, or A and D, to move.
