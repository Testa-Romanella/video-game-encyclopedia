The puzzles are simple at first but become increasingly difficult to 3-star at higher levels. But don't worry, even if you can't 3-star every level, you can still advance in the game and enjoy the relaxing music and sounds. And that's what makes it a Zen game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:28:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/4969764f792b980a3d4257d2d79ab7b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gawyn Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
