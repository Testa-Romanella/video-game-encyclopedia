{"id": 502035, "slug": "the-puny-climber", "name": "The Puny Climber", "name_original": "The Puny Climber", "description": "<p>In this sequel to the 2017 VR game The Mighty Eye you play as an unhatched eye. You have sticky hands that automatically attach to any surface so you can climb but also walk on your hands as if they were feet. That makes you like half your usual size, turning you into an agile little climber.</p>\n<p>Your every move will be watched by observing full fledged eyes, which are looking for bricks to build their tower with. They need to look at a certain number of same color bricks before they can collect them. You can help them collect or impede their efforts. Working with the eyes will reward you with high scores but you also need to reach coins which are the key to completing the levels.</p>\n<p>Provided as an early access version,\u00a0The Puny\u00a0Climber now features two\u00a0full chess boards containing over\u00a030\u00a0arcade levels! The boards are\u00a0placed at different spots on puny planet, an open world you have to traverse to make it to the next board.</p>\n<p>The outside world is a dangerous place. Watch out for the rats that guard collectible power ups and also come out swarming at night.</p>\n<p>Feel the action. When you dodge, you dodge. When you run, you run. It's the immersion of actual movement.</p>\n<p>Don't know what to do? Like, how to find the next chess board? Ask the UI for help with the press of a button. Any thumb button will do.</p>\n<p>First person gameplay. Third person replays. Rewind, fast forward, walk around the replay and watch from any angle.</p>\n<p>An Open VR headset with tracked controllers\u00a0is required to play this game. It has been developed with and tested on Oculus Quest with\u00a0Oculus Link on PC.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I can't test on other hardware which is why I need your help! Do you have a Vive, Vive\u00a0Focus, Valve Index, any Windows Mixed Reality or other Open VR headset? Please let me know if the game runs and the controls work for you.</p>\n<p>Here's a checklist of things you should be able to do:</p>\n<ul><li>Controllers: In the title screen you should see two Oculus Touch controllers which represent your tracked controllers. If for some reason the tracking doesn't work, they might be below you between the chess tiles on the ground. If they aren't there at all, the Start option will not appear and you won't be able to\u00a0start the game.</li><li>Thumb buttons: pressing any of these will prompt a hint from Unity-chan. If you're selecting a text option by looking at it, pressing any button should quick select it (so you don't have to wait for the charge to build up).</li><li>Triggers (the buttons you press with your index fingers): Used to collect coins or let loose of a surface. Doesn't work on the ground. You can test this by starting the game, find a level entrance (just follow Unity-chan and look through the gate you'll find there), start the level and climb a wall. Pressing the trigger on the attached hand should result in you letting go and falling. Touching a coin with this button pressed should collect it.</li><li>Grab button (the button below the trigger): After starting the game your hands will be represented by transparent spheres with pentagrams inside. Pressing the grab button should shrink the pentagram.</li><li>Sticks: These are used to scroll the credits and control the speed of replays. The credits can be viewed in the title screen. Turn around 180\u00b0 and you'll see them. Pushing the sticks up and down should override the natural scrolling direction and speed. Replays are viewed after you clear a level and return to the gate. Left should rewind, right should fast forward.</li><li>Touchpads: If your VR controllers don't have sticks, let me know if the touchpads can access the features I described for sticks and how well that works.</li></ul>\n<p>If any of these don't work please let me know in the comments. Please also state which VR set\u00a0you are using.\u00a0Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T07:20:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75cc7a7e8ba6b99113d06c5419ed6ed8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["VR5"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
