Lopez and this is my very first full-ish game, Sparky Sparky Boom Guy! It's basically a bomberman game, but I thought it would be the perfect first game to try my hand at.</p>\n<p>Anyways, on to the features!</p>\n<p><strong>Single Player Mode</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Go through a short but fun single player adventure blowing up baddies and facing a boss at the end! Pro tip: Destroy all the enemies in a level to get a special gift!</p>\n<p><strong>Local Multiplayer Mode</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sit down on the couch to play a game with the friends and fam! Use up to 4 controllers to play or a keyboard if only 2 people are playing. Blow each other up to see who's the better Boom Guy!</p>\n<p><strong>Hats!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Hats! It's finally available after so much headache! Woooo!</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this game for however short time you play it! <strong><em>It's free forever</em></strong> and, if this gets popular enough, I\u00a0might add more single player levels, more multiplayer stages, and more hats! But until then, I'll be working on my next game. Thank you so much and again, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f5882e3866e9f92e08d1e689ec5834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dexter D.
