These include:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Using the terrain to their advantage. Certain terrains provide bonuses to\u00a0DEF\u00a0and\u00a0AVOID.\r\n</li><li>Player units can trade between each other.\r\n</li><li>A player which can equip a staff can heal an adjacent unit.\r\n</li><li>A player can equip weapons / use consumable items.\r\n</li><li>A player can move by clicking a tile on the map.\r\n</li><li>A player can move towards an enemy, and initiate combat.\r\n</li><li>A player can enter a shop and purchase/sell items.\r\n</li><li>Jaffar, the main character\u00a0can move onto the boss tile and\u00a0Seize\u00a0it, based on the battle objective.</li></ol>\n<p>Tips and tricks for newcomers and veterans alike:\r\n</p>\n<p>There are numerous ways to take turn the tides of battle in your favor.

By staying on these tiles, the player can get various additions to their\u00a0DEF\u00a0and\u00a0AVOID. The terrain modal shown below will display the bonuses awarded for the tile that the cursor is hovering over. Use these terrains to your advantage in battle!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Trading</p>\n<p>In order to trade, move a friendly unit next to another friendly unit, then select\u00a0Trade. Both units inventories will be displayed. In order to trade:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Click one item on both units' inventory, and the items will be swapped.\r\n</li><li>You may trade repeatedly in a single turn, or with other units. Trading does\u00a0not\u00a0end your turn.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Healing</p>\n<p>Currently, the only playable unit that can heal is\u00a0Nino. You may equip a\u00a0Heal\u00a0staff, then move next to an adjacent player unit that has taken damage, and replenish some HP.\r\n</p>\n<p>NOTE:\u00a0You may\u00a0not\u00a0fight with a staff equipped, it will leave you defenseless. Equip staffs wisely.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Using items</p>\n<p>Items such as\u00a0Energy Drop,\u00a0Angelic Robe,\u00a0Vulnerary\u00a0and\u00a0Elixir\u00a0are consumable items which have the following effects:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Energy Drop: Permanently increases unit's strength by\u00a02.\r\n</li><li>Angelic Robe: Permanently increases unit's max health by\u00a07.\r\n</li><li>Vulnerary: Recovers 10 HP.\r\n</li><li>Elixir: Recovers 20 HP.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Equipping items works the same way.\r\n</p>\n<p>Movement</p>\n<p>Left-click a highlighted tile to move onto.

Once this selection has occurred, the player unit initiating the attack must then\u00a0left-click\u00a0an enemy to enter combat against them (in the case that there are multiple targets surrounding the player unit).\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Before entering combat, you can see the summary of the battle. This includes:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>How much HP both units have.\r\n</li><li>Equipped weapons of both units.\r\n</li><li>How much damage each unit can do to each other.\r\n</li><li>Hit rate of both units.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>During battle, if the\u00a0enemy\u00a0or\u00a0player\u00a0has a\u00a0significantly\u00a0higher\u00a0attack speed (AS)\u00a0than the other unit, then they will\u00a0attack twice\u00a0during combat.\r\n</p>\n<p>Shopping</p>\n<p>Stepping onto a shop tile (shown below) will allow the player to enter the shop, in which they can purchase or sell items.\r\n</p>\n\r\nSource Code &amp; Project Files:\r\n\n<p>Fire Emblem games in general can be broken down into several major components.
