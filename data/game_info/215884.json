Help sort them all out!<br/><br/></p>\r\nGame Description\r\n<p>This game was made using the minimalistic Bitsy game engine which is a very simple and easy to use tool for creating simple and small games, allowing you to focus on just a few core ideas and designs. <br/></p>\n<p>In this game your friend seems to have mixed up the wrapping tape on his presents, and you need to sort them out! Swap between packages and empty each one, then place back in the correct components to build the right present for the right person. Some objects are locked so you'll need to find the correct items and use them in the correct order to complete the game. (Don't worry it's easy ^.^)<br/></p>\n<p>The CONTROLS are only the Arrow Keys, or, alternatively, WASD on your keyboard. The use of these controls are shown in-game.</p>\n<p>The game does also feature an ending which is \"secret\", but it's not hard to find.</p>\n<p>Multiple hacks were used to customize and augment the Bitsy Engine's functionality. Borksy (Made by AYolland, further referenced below) was utilized to add the following hacks:</p>\n<ul><li>Exit from Dialogue (by @mildmojo)</li><li>End from Dialogue (by @mildmojo)</li><li>Solid Items (by Sean S. LeBlanc)</li></ul>\r\nAfterword\r\n<p>Sorry if there are any bugs or typoss! Feel free to point any out. I may get around to fixing any that pop up maybe.</p>\n<p>The recipients of the presents in this game are all based on people in the Bitsy Community (mostly in the Bitsy Discord mentioned below) and if you don't know them some of my references in the game might not make sense to you, but I hope you can still enjoy my little game! (And I hope the people referenced don't mind too much either :P)<br/></p>\n<p>Alright then, have fun people!</p>\n<p>~Ripple</p>\r\nSpecial Mentions\r\n<p>Bitsy Game Engine by Adam Le Doux: Thank you for creating such an awesome and easy to use tool!! And for keeping Bitsy updated and for communicating with the Bitsy Community!And for Game Jams wooo!</p>\n<p>Borksy: A hacking too used add multiple hacks to Bitsy at once. It makes adding hacks EXTREMELY easy and made some highly useful and time saving functions available!<br/></p>\n<p>Bitsy Discord: Bitsy has its own cozy community and it rocks!! Thank you so much guys for always answering my questions about Bitsy and for being fun and amazing and did I already say helpful and supportive? It can never be said enough!!</p>\n<p>Em: The first person referenced in my game and a super friendly and helpful person in the Discord! I thought it was Em who started the Borger meme but....maybe that was Ebeth.... I still hope you like your present?<br/></p>\n<p>DucklingSmith: The second person referenced and a standup chap he is. Good head on his shoulders, coming up with interesting ideas and stories. I hope you like your present!<br/></p>\n<p>BitsyOracle: The third person referenced, a friendly and talkative person who...likes crabs? From which I assumed you also like the sea....? Correct me if I'm wrong.<br/></p>\n<p>Onion: I don't want to overhype onion but.... this onion is preeeetty great. In about all respects. (I haven't made you look a bit too chubby in this have I?)<br/></p>\n<p>Sean: The fifth person referenced and probably knows magic. He programmed a lotta cool hacks and stuff for Bitsy to extend its use! Very knowledgeable! And a cool dude! Who has cats according to his other game!<br/></p>\n<p>Ebeth: Ebeth does community work, runs collabs, and is all around helpful and friendly.\u00a0 Ebeth was not featured in the game but was lined up for package 6/7 (but cut do to time constraints)... and since I seemed to have mixed up the Borger meme origin too I even considered swapping Ebeth with Em but... if it's not too indecent a proposal, maybe you two can share?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/406/40661917da9ed28228172d8af335e666.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RipplePoint"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
