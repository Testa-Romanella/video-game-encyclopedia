Their vehicle is nowhere near equipped for this job however, and so they must build up their ride using money acquired from collecting other highly sort after items such as rare artefacts, energised crystals, and raptor claws. The mechanic will reward the player handsomely for these, allowing the player to purchase upgrades to their vehicle such as the drill, automatic rifles, and eventually a grenade launcher. The player will need to make the most of all these tools if they're going to stay alive, only being able to spend a certain amount of time out in the desert before the storm begins to rip the flesh from their bones.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T03:43:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ce/5cecec72e0d9d7614abb3110541166ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brock Billings"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brock Billings"], "esrb_rating": null}
