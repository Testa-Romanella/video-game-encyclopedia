{"id": 829183, "slug": "find-my-mind", "name": "Find My Mind", "name_original": "Find My Mind", "description": "<p><strong>This VN is specifically made for \"O2A2 VN Jam 2022\" which has the following limitations: </strong><strong>\"Only One of Any Asset\" and 1000 words limit. \r\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI targeted the one CG rule in place of sprite and background.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: for WebGL build, play in fullscreen (1920x1080).<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Format</strong>: <em>Hidden Object Game</em>, <em>Interactive Fiction, Visual Novel</em>, <em>semi-kinetic</em> story with one ending.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Genre</strong>: <em>Thriller</em>, <em>Science Fiction</em>, <em>Cyberpunk </em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Themes:</strong> <em>Mental Health Commentary</em>, <em>Creative Struggle</em> (this game is NOT meant to be read as an accurate depiction of therapy and medical/scientific knowledge)</p>\n<p> <strong>Content warnings</strong>: Medical procedure, display of unhealthy behaviour<em>, </em>little bit dark (poverty references), frequent random screen shake &amp; fade in the last level.<br/></p>\n<strong>Word Count:</strong> <em>980 words</em> (+ click to see slight spoiler). Count performed on story script and choice option words.<br/>\r\n20 words as free space for the player. There is no input check which means you don't even have to stick to it (ssssht!). I have no way of telling what you wrote down anyway.\r\n\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&gt; Progress story text: </strong>with <em>Spacebar</em> or <em>Enter</em> key\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&gt; To move camera (level 2 and 3):</strong> drag mouse</p>\n\r\nGame Description:\r\n<p><strong>Overarching narrative about a back-alley therapist and their patient. </strong><strong>With 3 mini-game levels</strong>:</p>\n<p>&gt; <strong>Point &amp; Click section</strong>: find object(s) within the illustration. There is a timer and unique 'stage obstacle'. You can try again many times with no progress lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt; <strong>Microfiction</strong>: each object tells its own 100-word story.<br/></p>\n\r\nEngine:\r\n<p><strong>This is built in Unity with Fungus</strong>. The game is missing VN features that are normally expected in Ren'Py. <br/></p>\n<p>&gt; <strong>No volume controller\u00a0\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>&gt; <strong>Save System</strong>: <em>Only</em><em> one save game</em>. Works on <em>autosave</em> and no manual saving. (Recommended to quit game when you return to the title screen or you may skip over story parts). The location of the save file is described here:\r\n https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>&gt; The level music is a little bit bugged. (One music track is used throughout the game + hard-coded timestamps to tell which part of the song it plays. Normally you simply cut the main song into 2 new songs, but for challenge sake.. it did not work out perfectly).\u00a0<br/></p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Developed by Gaming Variety Potato (coding, writing, art)<br/></p>\n<p>Maze BG used in GUI (edited from): Freepik<br/></p>\n<p>See full list of attribution for the used assets within the game itself.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T08:26:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c71/c711082221e25aa877ea351c711adea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gaming Variety Potato"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
