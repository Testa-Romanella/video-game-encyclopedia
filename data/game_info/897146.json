Perhaps the most important. You are to head to the malevolent AI's core, and upload a virus to kill it for good.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Be aware, the AI's forces will try to stop you, landing on droves to take you down. Stay strong and stay alive, for if you fall, the upload process will be cut and the mission will fail.</em></p>\n<p><em>Are you up to the task?</em></p>\n<p>_________________________________________</p>\n<p>This was a game developed for the 7DFPS game jam, a game done in 7 days.\u00a0</p><p>You play as a droid trying to hold off the forces of an evil AI as you upload a virus to kill the AI overlord. The upload takes 5 minutes to complete, and the more you hold off, the more they will press in numbers.</p><p>Luckily, your allies will send and install upgrades onto you as you keep blasting the opposing forces.</p><p>Best wishes to your success. I hope this is a short but good one.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Mouse =&gt; Aim</li><li>WASD keys =&gt; Move</li><li>Left Click =&gt; Fire</li><li>Spacebar =&gt; Jump</li><li>Left Shift (Hold) =&gt; Run</li></ul><p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Game made by InkiCrow</li><li>Droid voices performed by Bonniecakes</li><li>Font \"E1234\" made by GGBotNet</li><li>Sounds used provided by Zach Striefel and Gamemaster Audio (fromGamedev Market)</li><li>Game developed in the Godot Engine v3.4.4</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f0/7f04c0d5ca4ee2741c82b46617bbe0f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inki Crow"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
