If you liked this, please let us know and support us so we can create the other two Chapters as well! :)<br/></p>\n<p>If you played the Game, please take a couple minutes to answer this survey, it would mean a lot to us and help write our Bachelor's Thesis. :) </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Team:\r\n<p>Anneke Stiehler - Programming &amp;\u00a0Game Design</p>\n<p>Malika Widmayer - Environment &amp;\u00a0TechArt</p>\n<p>Marlena Themann -\u00a0Characters &amp;\u00a0Dialogue</p>\n<p>Wieland M\u00fcller - Sound Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:33:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b84581bdb25b7cd2b802832e85374315.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mingapur", "doctormooh", "anneke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
