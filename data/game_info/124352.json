I say this is a job for the rescue rangers! I'll go on ahead, Chip, and scatter some things of mine that might help while we search the city. Good idea, Gadget! that's the spirit. Dale, you and I can start on the trail. Monty why don't you and Zipper... Track down one of those strange mechanical dogs we've been seeing in the park lately? Mechanical dogs??!! Uh-- piece 'o cake, Chip! We'll get right on it. You can depend on us!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tVideo:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHome page: http://gcup.ru/games/CDRR/\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a4/9a401d44a0f4715eea5b341978e47d7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Russian Gamedevelopment Community"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
