The main aspect of the game is our multi-player part where you can connect with 7 more friends and start exploring all the questions that we prepared for you. With over 9 domains I am sure that some will fit you, but if you want you can play random sets of questions from all domains. <br/>If your friends are busy, you can try the <strong>single-player</strong> part of the game where you will try to answer correct as many questions as you can. And don't worry if you get a wrong answer, when you finish the domain you can go back and re-answer the wrong ones.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T06:33:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaf/eaf21c8915264144131d2caed82ccab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DreamDeveloper-Studio"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["DreamDeveloper-Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
