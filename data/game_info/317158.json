(free)", "description": "Three seconds until the shell blows your hull. Six enemies on the Grid, some protected by shields, one charged with energy and about to blow up.<br/><br/>Two seconds. An item that increases the score multiplier appears. If the Pulse reaches the charged enemy the chain reaction will clear the grid, but you won't survive this time. Quick, think!<br/><br/>One second. You set your path, a bit convoluted, but it will do, and your ship leaps forward, just a few milliseconds away from death. It slides through the Grid, through your enemies, through the powerup. Your score increases and you break your record.<br/><br/>More entities appear, one shoots a homing missile. Three seconds until it blows your hull...<br/><br/>An arcade puzzle game where quick thinking and path planning will slide you toward the highest score in the leaderboards!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:38:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a1/4a1dc7bd908e3b2a6f89f21ce5a3b134_iIG9Jmk.jpg", "website": "http://playmedusa.com/slider", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Medusa"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Luis Anton Canalis"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
