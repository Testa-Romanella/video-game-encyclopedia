Players can lay track (including tunnels and overpasses), pick from over 40 locomotives from early steams to modern bullets, choose to haul over 35 types of cargo in a dynamic economy, and participate in an advanced stock market.<br />\nThe new 3-D engine takes the franchise to the next level, allowing smooth scaling from an &#39;eye in the sky&#39; view of an entire continent down to super detailed close-up of a beautifully modeled train, building, or just the landscape.<br />\nRailroad Tycoon 3 also includes more multiplayer support than its predecessor, integrating an on-line chat and matchmaking service. To top everything off, the game&#39;s soundtrack features another installment of some of the best authentic blues, bluegrass, and Americana music around.<br />\nMultiplayer available in LAN mode only.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2003-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-25T12:13:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d2c/d2cadf03e51279f747c453310bc22cb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.17, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 25, "owned": 530, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 12}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 455, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PopTop"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["2K Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
