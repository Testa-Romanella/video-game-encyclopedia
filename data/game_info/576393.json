Like any great video game, it combines the need of great game sense, as well as mechanical skill to be able to progress.  For the moment, you can play against an A.I. or online, and are able to customize your games.  Obviously, your can choose from an ever-increasing selection of countries (each with their own amazing water polo caps) and select your game-length as well as the number of players per team.  We have an ambitious, yet realistic, 4-phased plan to turn this game into one of the all-time best:<strong>Phase 1:</strong> - Feb - April 2021<br/>       This is the release of WIN onto the Steam market - remember it's <strong>completely free!</strong>  During the first few weeks after release, we hope to adapt the game to the community's wants, such as a broader control of gameplay, and patch any rare bugs that might appear.<strong>Phase 2:</strong> - June  2021<br/>       Here we will introduce a competitive game-mode with skill-based matchmaking and a ranking system - obviously there will be world-leaderboards and the top-ranking players might be asked to play in an all-star game with big rewards for the winners!<strong>Phase 3:</strong> - End of August 2021 and beyond<br/>     Finally, WIN looks like a top-ranking video game and is starting to look at an <strong>ESPORT SCENE!</strong> The game will bug-less, smoother to play, and you will have inventories to collect items to trade or use.  From now we will (or try to) have monthly updates with new competitive seasons, and fun new features.<br/><br/><br/>Invest into WIN because we <strong>promise</strong> that it'll be worth it.  You could be looking at the next best game!  Do you want to be the best?  Do you want to be the greatest?  Then start playing early and it will pay off. Who knows, you may become a <strong>world Esport champion!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T02:58:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13c/13c536056e07163a713fe8d4d2f14d1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laugames"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Laugames"], "esrb_rating": null}
