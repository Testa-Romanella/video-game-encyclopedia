The game was designed to simple to start playing but increasingly\u00a0difficult\u00a0when trying to achieve higher score. The\u00a0leaderboard system was implemented with LootLocker.</p>\n<p>The theme \"Magnetism\" is included in the game trough the interaction\u00a0between the planets and other game elements. Even though in a narrative sense there is no magnets in the game the interactions are heavily inspired by how magnets behave.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong>lrdazrl</p>\n<p>DrPetter's sfxr tool was used to create most of the\u00a0sound effect<br/>Shift\u00a0asset package was used for sprites and one sound effect.<br/>LootLocker\u00a0leaderboard system was implemented based on their documentation and tutorial. I had completed a\u00a0part of tutorial before the jam start time so part of the\u00a0code for leaderboard\u00a0\u00a0scripts is based on \"premade asset\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T20:31:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/9821dd1bf17ca02f3cb238fc0231f777.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lrdazrl"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
