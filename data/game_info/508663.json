But none actually got finished, and eventually i ended up returning to the main idea i was aiming for. The Beginner Circle Game Jam got me a hell of two weeks of hard work and developing and that was so fun, YES nothing came to light of my two week of work but just the experience is enough, and the game has two levels i hope you like them and Thank you\u00a0Angry Smile owner of the jam for making the jam.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY?</strong></p>\n<p>The game controls are so simple :\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>A &amp; left arrow : go left.</li><li>D &amp; right arrow : go right.</li><li>W &amp; up arrow : fly up.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Music are from\u00a0Robert Tar very amazing track.
