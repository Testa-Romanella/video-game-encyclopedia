Your only goal: GET THE FOG OUT.</p>\n<p>In<em> Get the Fog Out</em>, you, the player, ran into some misfortune on your space travels and crash landed on a desolate planet covered in a thick, ominous fog. With help from Nexy, your ship\u2019s emergency Nexus Drone, you fight your way through the fog, soon discovering that it isn\u2019t as docile as you first thought.  </p>\n<p><em>Get the Fog Out</em> is an isometric game that takes inspiration from real-time strategy games and base builders. It was made in Unity by Under Ctrl, a team of third-year games students from Swinburne University. The game has been showcased at Swinburne Open Day 2019 and PAX Australia 2019 alongside other games produced by Swinburne games students.  </p>\n<p>Website: http://underctrlgames.xyz/\r\n</p>\n<p>Presskit: http://underctrlgames.xyz/presskit/index.php\r\n</p>\n<p>Discord server: https://discord.gg/RF92UYE</p>\n<p>Twitter: Under Ctrl\r\n</p>\n<p>Email: underctrlgames@gmail.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Emily Cox: Creative Director, Writer</li><li>Liam Dunstan: UI Programmer, UI Designer, Social Media Manager</li><li>Cyrus Edgren: Lead Programmer</li><li>Matthew Germon: Sound Design, Programmer</li><li>Josh Hardy: Producer, Designer</li><li>Sam Huffer: Fog/Tutorial/Dialogue Programmer</li><li>James Latham: Composer</li><li>Nikkie Loney: 3D Artist</li><li>Michael Nuttall: Technical Artist</li><li>David Sam: Programmer</li></ul>\n<p>Our thanks to our lecturer Andrew Trevillian and our tutors Joe Park, Laura Voss and Tom Baker for their professional input and feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:38:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/005/005fe230fc793f145cc7f605d02fc9ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheAioliGuy", "Aravien", "liamcgd", "huf0001", "Manticore", "UnderCtrlGames", "david-sam22", "Nikkita Racquel", "emily97", "MJGermon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
