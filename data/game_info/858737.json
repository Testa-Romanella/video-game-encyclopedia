I also thought (not yet implemented) making the plants spawn only from the borders (possibly from\u2026 factory \u2018plants\u2019).<br/></p>\r\nUnfinishness and (at least) a bug\r\n<p>The game is quite unfinished, and partially broken/buggy, as it can reach the limit number of sprites and then keep throwing an error, if too many stems/plants are generated (you can see this as an unintended game over, I guess\u2026). I did not submit it because I felt it was too lacking, especially since this is a mere one-day first creation instead of a full-blown ten-day one (although I did for Brackeys 2022.2 and it turned out well! But this time, I had to learn the tools, so the result is far less reasonable). I was inspired by some great games from GBJam 9, and thought the ten-day period was a great opportunity to make a rather substantial game, but things got in the way. ._.<br/></p>\n<p>I am interested to know how to print the stems on the background rather than as sprites, as it would solve the sprite limit issue, so I am publishing in hopes someone can answer, and I still learn something out of it!</p>\r\nThe Future\r\n<p>I am keeping this game and page to expand the game as I make progress in Game Boy development; it might get in the direction of a shoot \u2019em up. It might also not. Still experimental!</p>\n<p>Glad to have started to learn and experiment with Game Boy development. :) I also tried out GB Studio a bit, but I think RGBDS will be the way to go for me in the future, as it makes the most sense for both optimisation (using ASM assembly) and freedom reasons.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T13:43:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda9e0a002bd09953e9c97302bd1fd94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mossieur Patate"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
