Spend your money on any other thing if you don't have any sense of humor - it's the world's request, not mine. <br/>In this game, you need to close the pop-ups, what is popping up. (Such creative description, wow) If you have too many popups on screen, you'll lose, but if you close enough popups, you'll have lots of irritating screen glitches, just for fun.
