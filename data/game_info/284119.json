{"id": 284119, "slug": "cannon-balls", "name": "Cannon Balls", "name_original": "Cannon Balls", "description": "A simple game of shooting balls from a cannon to fill moving buckets, but watch out: each bucket needs a specific number of balls to be completed and if it reaches the bottom with insufficient balls then you lose a life! <br/><br/>The buckets come faster and faster as time goes on, and since you have a limited number, you should use your balls carefully. Only balls that don't make it into a bucket are lost.<br/><br/>If you're stuck in a tricky situation you might be lucky enough to have a power-up appear. Just shoot a ball at the power-up to collect it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T03:13:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e2/4e26bbabeeba583f15287cc39e5671b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Wix Games"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Wix Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
