Discover what happened in the circus 25 years ago!<br/><br/>Our story started quite ordinary. You got an offer to visit a legend circus but you will forever remember that trip! The exploration went wrong from the very beginning: horrible atmosphere, broken lights, and insufficient cell-phone battery to make a call.
