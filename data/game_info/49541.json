Sail on ancient seas, explore unknown worlds, and witness one of the world\u2019s most important ancient sites. Experience it now!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLithodomos VR has painstakingly recreated ancient Ephesus, allowing you to step back in time and explore the city in all of its original splendour and glory. You are a sailor in the 2nd Century AD, and your mission is to deliver precious goods - but your ship is off course, and you must first steer it safely into the harbour. Be careful along the way: piracy is well known in the Roman world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis Lithodomos VR experience is not just engaging and entertaining, but is a valuable educational tool of great historical significance. Every detail has been researched and approved and is backed-up by archaeological evidence. If you can\u2019t travel to Turkey, or travel back in time, then this is the most important cultural experience you can have.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e35/e350471488cf88f4977e22e3524a390a.jpg", "website": "http://lithodomosvr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lithodomos VR"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Lithodomos VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
