This was my first project assembled in Unity and was coded using C#. The sprites were hand drawn with ink on tracing paper for Inktober. The purpose of the assignment was to utilize vector forces for controls and physics. I recently added a bit more juice and functionality to the prototype to flesh it out as a portfolio piece.</p>\n<p>Navigation</p>\n<p>Unity Project Files<br/>C# Scripts<br/>Documentation<br/>Citations<br/>Sample Video<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/938e6907b990deecffb798a5209c8b4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TuckerBurke"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
