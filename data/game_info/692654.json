One morning, a carrier pigeon arrives at Doc Hendersen\u2019s farm with a message. The message comes from Communion Creek, an isolated settlement in the far north of the Fairborne Mountains. The news is amazing, a woman in Communion Creek is pregnant, and due to give birth. In order for the baby to have any chance of survival, Doc knows he has to inoculate the child as soon as it is born.
