As such, the quality may be subpar and the game might be full of bugs. It might even randomly crash.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A game submitted to the\u00a0Fragment Jam.\u00a0 A small roguelike prototype meant for both standalone and Android I created in 2014. I focused mostly on balancing and equipment drops so the rest of the game suffered. It also has a major bug causing the level generator to crap out after floor 3 or so, so that floor gets repeated infinitely. Yay.</p>\n<p>I imported this in Unity 2019.3 alpha and made builds for different platforms including WebGL. That process probably caused some more bugs, but that's just how the cookie crumbles I'm afraid. I also had an original (probably working) Windows build from 2014, but it slows down my beefy PC to a crawl when trying to launch it and doesn't even show anything.</p>\n<p>I've included an Android build I found from the original dev folder back in 2014, you can try that if you're brave enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow keys or mouse: Move / Attack<br/>Mouse: Use menus and inventory.<br/>ESC: Open game menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T05:20:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c5b7bc34ba9ae804e56c48a05f2bf5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["BlackDragonBE"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
