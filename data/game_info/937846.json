To help them navigate the hazards and debris, the player comes equipped with omni-directional thrusters, magnet boots to walk on walls and ceilings, bombs to clear out debris and their trusty Singularity Cannon, a device that shoots artificial gravity probes. With those tools and their ability to plan out trajectories in zero-gravity, the player needs to explore as much of the station as possible to collect loot within the time limit. Once the imminent destruction is near, the station starts breaking down, urging them to escape. Some push their luck trying to collect just a little more loot to please their corporate overlords, even when it might become a one way trip. Sometimes, that\u2019s a risk worth taking for a higher payday in this galaxy.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Walk / Use directional thrusters</li><li>Spacebar - Jump</li><li>Left Click - Shoot Gravball</li><li>Right Click - Shoot Bomb</li></ul>\n\r\nChangelog\r\n0.02\r\n<ul><li>Gravball throw cancelling\u00a0</li><li>Added placeholder art</li><li>Added bombs\u00a0</li><li>Added player stun state\u00a0</li><li>Added new mechanics\u00a0<ul><li>Gates\u00a0</li><li>Plug and socket switch\u00a0</li><li>Electrified surfaces\u00a0</li><li>Passthrough structures\u00a0</li><li>Explosive barrels\u00a0</li><li>Breakable hinges\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Added new rooms<ul><li>Corridor\u00a0</li><li>Collapsed corridor\u00a0</li><li>Elevator shaft\u00a0</li><li>Reactor room\u00a0</li><li>AI room\u00a0</li><li>Lounge\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Added alarm state (gates lock and floor lights blink red)\u00a0</li><li>Added post-processing, lighting,\u00a0various feedbacks and effects\u00a0</li><li>Misc. tweaks</li></ul>\r\n0.01\r\n<ul><li>Initial Prototype</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T19:51:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/860/860268da8a93278410496e0bfe0d9443.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mista Lounge"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
