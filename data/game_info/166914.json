In this demo, there's a placeholder tutorial to teach you the basics of how to play, and one opponent for you to fight against.</p><p>Changelog:</p><p>+Gamepad support added! You can now play through the entire game and navigate all of the menus with X-input compatible controllers, such as an PS4 or Xbox One controller. You can't rebind the controller bindings in this build, but that is a feature I have planned for the future.</p><p>+The game new runs in a widescreen resolution by default.</p>\n<p>+Many changes to Paahul's AI. Enemy collision has also been completely rewritten from the ground up. Most hit registration bugs have been fixed as a result.</p><p>+Many small changes to make controlling the player character feel more responsive.\u00a0</p><p>+New title screen art! Because that's important enough to list in a changelog, I guess!</p><p>+Many bugs squashed!</p>\n<p>Known quirks/issues/changes in this build:</p><p>-There's *still* no audio, sorry. Audio is hard!</p><p>-While playing in the tutorial, the rapid jabs and rapid hooks super attacks don't loop correctly.</p><p>-Attempting to force the game into fullscreen on windows 10 can cause a hard crash. This is a Gamemaker 1.4 compiler\u00a0issue I can't fix without porting the game to Gamemaker 2. I'm in the process of porting the game over to Gamemaker 2 for next demoday, but until then please don't try to force fullscreen the game on windows 10.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58a/58a3afdd23b0269791255357479f6c78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kickindev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
