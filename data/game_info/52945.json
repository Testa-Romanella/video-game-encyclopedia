TOSE ported both titles from the Super Nintendo Entertainment System; each had been previously released as individual Japanese PlayStation ports in 1997 (Final Fantasy IV) and 1999 (Chrono Trigger). Several bonus features were added to each game, such as art galleries, bestiaries, and cutscenes\u2014including computer-generated full motion video used at the beginning of Final Fantasy IV and anime scenes used throughout Chrono Trigger.</p>\n<p>Final Fantasy Chronicles was received well by players and critics, who praised the peripheral features and the fact that Square was offering RPG classics to a new generation of gamers. Conversely, reviewers sharply criticized \"long and frequent loading\" between areas and battles due to poor emulation. Enough copies of Chronicles were sold to warrant a second release as part of Sony's Greatest Hits in June 2003.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-24T22:26:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce6571adfa8a7a3fda23c569ce112621.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 8, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Square", "Tose", "Tose Co."], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "Square Enix", "Square"], "esrb_rating": null}
