It's only barely illustrated though, haha.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Quick word about adventure games:</strong>\u00a0The game will present you a short text and will ask you: \u201cWhat do you want to do now ?\u201d. You will dialog using only words that you type with your keyboard, and then press \u201center\u201d to validate. You can use only one word at a time (because it is a limited adventure).</p>\r\nYou need to play the rom on an emulator ! Here's a cool one online\u00a0https://virtualconsoles.com/online-emulators/c64/\u00a0!\r\n<p>This adventure exposes how I wish video games culture was more inclusive. I don't want to imply that girls don't play videogames, as I'd be ill-placed to say that. I have a ton of gamer girl friends, but here I focus on girls I've met that don't identify as gamers. Or rather that self define as \"non gamers\".\u00a0</p>\r\nSo, hi to everygirl I've talked about games \u00a0at parties ! It was always super cool \u2764\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>To play the game: </strong>drag and drop it on the C64 emulator of your choice. I've found that it sometimes takes some time to load\u00a0on online emulators (but sometimes no ?! Does someone know why ? Is it vice that randomly makes better export ?).\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want to make games using Graphic Adventure Creator, it's available for free on super cool archive sites like gamebase64 (but it's also available on the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. So many possibilities !).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:53:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711dc9048aec92d5f861d43a4c3d471b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["matote"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
