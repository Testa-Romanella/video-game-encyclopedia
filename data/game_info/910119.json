The game jam's theme was \" Something Uniquely African\".\u00a0\u00a0My team, Vetkoek Studios, are all from South Africa, so we decided to stick to something that was unique to South Africa. As soon as we received the theme, I immediately got load-shedding, so I suggested that we make our game about load-shedding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you do not know what load-shedding is,\u00a0\u00a0it is when our electricity supply is purposely switched off by the power suppliers\u00a0to avoid excessive load on the generating plant.\u00a0 It can be very frustrating and takes a toll on us South Africans.</p>\n<p>But, with our load-shedding game, we won first prize! This awarded us with an incubation that sponsors us for the year,2023, to work on this game.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T08:11:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffd/ffde880d62de8ea5becf2cf12cfc086a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Feral Jalapeno"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
