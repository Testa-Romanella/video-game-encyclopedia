Note that he will get faster over time. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move around. I think the game fits the theme because you are on a small island.\u00a0The font is Inika Bold and made by Constanza Artigas Preller. Feedback on the game would be appreciated! <strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> if you are playing the web version, do not press the quit button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T07:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8f9a9650af64b8b8cc0b4e840eae3e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["A J"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
