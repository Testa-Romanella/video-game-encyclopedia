Just a silly urban legend. A game made to scare kids by other kids. And it's working. None of your friends at school wanted to try this game with you. But you're no chicken. You know that it's just a little game. You're not scared of some words you found in a dusty book.</p>\n<p>But it didn't take too long for the feeling to sink in that this isn't like the time you said Bloody Mary three times. This isn't like the time you stacked pencils on paper and asked Charlie Charlie questions about life. The air around you has changed, like something has marked your spot on the earth, and as you sit in your bed waiting to play... You can't shake the feeling that this is something real.<br/></p>\n<p>The rules are simple. From 11PM to midnight in the waning minutes of Halloween night, you must play a game of keepaway. Your opponent is Samhain, the ancient ghost of Halloween. Your goal is to keep him at bay with your lights, and his goal... Is to snuff your brightest light out. They say that everyone who's played this game has failed... Maybe you'll be the first.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T06:39:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb7/cb745439368b170d6a4ac59fe738994e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eclipse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
