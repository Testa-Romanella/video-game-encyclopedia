This theme first triggered the idea of having people helping each other in order to reach a higher level goal, all together and in a positive mood. The\u00a0first draft was a human tower reaching a pinata.\u00a0<br/>I decided to implement game mechanics showing people supporting each other,\u00a0collaborating even when playing solo : multiple characters to control, with several small goals allowing\u00a0the team to reach the ultimate goal : the pinata.<br/><br/>My personal challenge here was around efficiency and quick decision making: I participated alone, and\u00a0only had 2 and a half day to spend on the JAM, to\u00a0do what I usually do in at least 4 days.</p>\n<p>If you liked the game and spent 5 nice minutes playing it, and\u00a0want to support us... the best way is to share the game to some friends, as well as\u00a0to follow us\u00a0to keep informed about upcoming releases. Arcade Eleven is a young game development studio, consisting in 1 guy and some casuals friends/guests/contributors.\u00a0 Leaving a comment is always a great source of motivation, and it also helps us to see if there's an interested in going further with the game.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>The JAM version is using several assets\u00a0under CC licence.
