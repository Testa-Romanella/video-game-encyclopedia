Your illigal activities will make money for you, whilst you plot your next scheme,\u00a0 but be weary, the police are on your tail, and they are closing in. When they get too close, you must pause your illigal activities to avoid being busted, and resume them whenever the police has backed off. But while you wait for the police to heat to die down, the police will be compiling evidence of past activites, potentially leading to a bust.\u00a0this is all up to you to manage! Get rich or die trying.</p>\n\n\r\nGameJam\r\n<p>This game is made specifically for the Mini Jam 60, with the theme of crime, and the restriction that all games must focus on pausing. The game was made in one day, and still needs a bit of balancing.\u00a0Sound and animation has been added, as well as an introduction to the main mechanichs\u00a0 at the start of each game.\u00a0Please enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:24:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b40/b40541937b698d7420810af1e500df1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tail Clap Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
