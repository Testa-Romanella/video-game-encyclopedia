The novel breaks new ground in exploring the relation between the individual and power, asking why the villagers so readily submit to an authority which may exist only in their collective imagination.</p>\n<p>This is an interactive adaptation of the novel allowing both an immersive and non-linear exploration of the text, as well as the ability to make a few choices differently than Kafka's protagonist \"K\" leading to alternate outcomes. Kafka's own novel was incomplete, literally ending mid-sentence, so similarly this work can, also, only ever be incomplete.</p>\n<p>The current release implements chapters 1 through 5 of the novel.</p>\n<p>To run the standalone gblorb file (not yet available) you will need to install an interpreter such as Gargoyle:\u00a0https://github.com/garglk/garglk/releases</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:03:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae4/ae4104747014e1b16659677e8b8c8f2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jesse Burneko"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
