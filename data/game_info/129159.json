There is no meta progression and there is only one character deck. (You can play as The Poet by clicking around but no specific cards). </p><p>I did not have the time resources to put in a tutorial (watch the video for an ideo of how to play) and some parts (any cards with a skull symbol on them) were mostly working working but I turned them off for this version due to bugs.<br/></p><p>Speaking of, there are a few lingering and hard to produce bugs in the game. but if you encounter any, I am sorry. The biggest one is that sometimes when you run out of cards, the game will freeze and I am not sure why.<br/></p><p>Content creation is a bear for a card game  but I feel I learned a lot through the experience as always.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1f/f1fbeb9a18c10ca3a0f4ea38f520c967.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zbaker5"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
