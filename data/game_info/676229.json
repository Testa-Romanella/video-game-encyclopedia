The nest is very unstable and will tilt easily. Correct relocation of center of mass is crucial for you and the eggs to not fall over the border. You can grab and throw eggs around to balance things out.</p>\n<p>Wind forces that get more frequent and stronger over time will require you to react fast if you want to succeed. Tipp: Use your airborne stomp attack\u00a0to create a big impact and turn things around for a moment.</p>\n<p>There are predators that are out to get their paws on your delicious unhatched siblings. Throw those intruders out of the nest before they can manage to steal any eggs.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to keep at least one egg unharmed for as long as possible. You lose once all eggs have fallen out of the nest or have been stolen. You will see how long you managed to survive on the game over screen.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nAssets and Resources\r\n<p>All assets and resources have been created ourselves.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T12:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5db/5db11c3e9baf767ce991aba556a5eea5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Andreas Roschal", "woergbi", "BananaBobBert"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
