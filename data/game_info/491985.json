Ostracized by his family, he decided to live alone. But he found that the outside world is full of danger, he had not met so many monsters, he can only avoid them to get food, he is not willing to accept defeat so home.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBarbarian adventure is an adventure game. Players only need to \"up and down\" control left and right movement, \"space\" jump to operate the barbarians to avoid the monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can use all the routes you want, as long as you can eat all the \"food\" in the scene, you can go to the next scene.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou won't get to the next scene without eating all the \"food.\" There is no way to attack in this game. All you have to do is avoid it. The movement patterns of monsters need to be explored by the player himself. It's easier to find patterns. I want the player to get the food and get to the next location as soon as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMaybe you'll find some unexpected surprises in the game. Maybe we will find more beauty in the casual.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T08:37:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c7/9c7c1c23aca5cf71a2f6f00aeb8f1e5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScGame"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ScGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
