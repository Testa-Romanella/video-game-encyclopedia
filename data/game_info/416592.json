The occult has taken over half the the nation with demonic influences. But Monotheos City is the location that the occult needs\u00a0to really put an end to\u00a0the city's Godly influence on the other surrounding states. Because Monotheos is surrounded by some of the largest bodies of water in the nation, it is a huge asset for the Demonic Occult. The occult wants to use the water to accelerate their demonic\u00a0serum\u00a0agenda. They want to steal the city's landmark\u00a0Bible tech and apply it in advancing\u00a0the ease of their own Occult bibles. The city's bibles are infused with state-of-the-art technology that makes the bible easier to understand and remember for visual learners within the city.\u00a0The occult leader puts his plan in motion and uses five of his demonic occult generals to steal the city's technology. The occult leader then goes after the potential Godly\u00a0threats in the area to solidify his\u00a0plans\u00a0to take over Monotheos.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/778/7787f82fee3aa8da00b425333cf4acaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Devon B."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
