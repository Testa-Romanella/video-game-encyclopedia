I would suggest playing in Chrome instead. Games may sometimes have the audio heavily desync with the game in Firefox.

You can find that script here.</p><p>Thank you to @DesignInVan for coming up with the algorithm for making the pretty backgrounds, and letting me use it in my game. <br/></p><p>Big thanks to everyone who has helped  playtest this game and offer feedback and advice during its development.</p><p>Getting all of this together was a huge challenge, especially in regards to making everything fit, but it was a really great learning experience and I enjoyed figuring out how to make everything work in an elegant way.</p><p>Thank you for playing!
