It is just classic Tic-Tac-Toe. It is for 2 players only. When the game asks you to put your X or your O in a spot, you have to type in one of these: tl/tm/tr/ml/mm/mr/bl/bm/br. Those are all the different positions on the board. For example, \"tr\" means top right, or \"ml\" means middle left. It is always the row followed by the column (top right, or tr because it is on the top row and the right side/column), and \"mm\" means middle middle. So the very middle of the board.\u00a0Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T04:35:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df3c70a1252297059e7fed1b547c1247.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Henry"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
