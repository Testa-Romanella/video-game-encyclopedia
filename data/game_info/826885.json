Pick up your blood-sword and investigate - are these intruders the old enemies from your past, or as yet unknown foes to conquer? No matter, they have rooted themselves into the ship and defiled all that is sacred to you with their foul presence. It is time to drive them out into the void and save your people.<br/><br/>Awaken prince, and carve a red ruin!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Diluvian Ultra: Chapter One includes 10 levels + a hub, 6 different weapons with 30 different upgrades and 13 enemy types. <br/><br/>Further chapters continuing Atilla\u2019s story as well as expanding his arsenal and the roster of enemies to obliterate will be released as paid DLCs at a future date.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Diluvian Ultra\u2019s combat is built around a dual-damage system where you have to combine weapons to be effective. Armour absorbs damage, but some weapons are designed to quickly strip it off your targets - unable to kill them, but exposing them for a single lethal blow. You have to be careful though, as enemies will mix their attacks in the same way. Collect and consume blood to upgrade your weapons and pick up various power-ups at the opportune moment, to become vengeance incarnate - if only for a while!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Surviving in Diluvian Ultra is all about mobility. Dodge enemy fire while you chain together ranged attacks with close combat blows and devastating ground slams. Double-jump, dash, find cover and even deflect projectiles with your sword, but never stay in one place for too long!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your spaceship home is a living combination of flesh and stone, and so it is with your arsenal of weapons; use both traditional Tech weapons as well as grotesque, living Organic armaments, and don\u2019t forget to take good care of your closest companion, your sentient Squire Gun, Bella.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Diluvian Ultra may be an over the top retro FPS filled with frenetic action, but all that carnage is set on a background of an epic, tragic story tackling the themes of fanaticism, trauma, betrayal and hope for redemption, playing out in neo-gothic architectural set pieces and immense, cathedral-like spaceships.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T05:51:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/404/4045a88d51324d13eda8aa26f245f2df.jpg", "website": "https://diluviangame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 521, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crest Helm Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fulqrum Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
