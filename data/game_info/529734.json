There's no objective. There's really only an exploration of an idea that I'd been toying around with in my mind for a long time. While trying to define my manifesto, I kept coming back to this idea- though\u00a0I originally couldn't quite parse the reason for this. After fiddling with this prototype for a few days, I think I finally started to understand why:\u00a0<em>my manifesto is still in flux</em>. I'm still discovering aspects of games and software of which I\u00a0approve/disapprove. I'm still limit-testing my personal flavor, the tools I use to make games, and the creativity I find in everyday things that inspire my games. Of course, I have a few concrete rules to my games: they should always be fun win or lose, they need to be presentable, they should feel \"smooth,\" and they should demand a player's attention. But what do these pieces really mean in isolation?\u00a0Not much. The combination of these parts is still something I'm searching for, and the only way to find it is to keep making games!</p>\r\nL/R ArrowsMoveU/DRotate while in the airSpaceJumpSShow statsRRestart the level", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T07:41:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80a/80a0af4c5dba8cdac89be1ad7b03a07b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
