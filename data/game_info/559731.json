It's written from scratch in C++ using SFML. Despite that it's quite feature rich.

It's definitely possible to finish. I've done that many times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The source code is available here. Though it's not much to look at.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:15:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20b/20b41a50dfec9ae61d7e915a5e51d893.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Korotkiewicz"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
