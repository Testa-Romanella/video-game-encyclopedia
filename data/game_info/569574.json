I would love to spoil what's coming, but I'll save the teasing for when I'm ready to release more. This is a solo project, so things may be a little slow.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nGame Descriptions\r\nHeir's Sword\r\n<p>Rise up against your own bloodline. Navigate the cruel treacherous labyrinth populated by all manner of creatures, take down your foes with the weapon bestowed upon you by the very father you are destined to destroy and claim your right as king of the land.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\nMenu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n<strong>KB+M</strong>\u00a0\r\n\u00a0<strong>PS</strong>\r\n\u00a0<strong>Xbox</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIRM\r\n\u00a0Space\r\n\u00a0Cross\r\n\u00a0A\r\n\r\n\r\nBACK\r\n\u00a0Esc\r\n\u00a0Circle\r\n\u00a0B\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeir's Sword\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n<strong>KB+M</strong>\u00a0\r\n\u00a0<strong>PS</strong>\r\n\u00a0<strong>Xbox</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVE\r\n\u00a0WASD\r\n\u00a0D-Pad/Left Analogue\r\n\u00a0D-Pad/Left Analogue\r\n\r\n\r\nJUMP\r\n\u00a0Space\r\n\u00a0Triangle\r\n\u00a0Y\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACK\r\n\u00a0LMB\r\n\u00a0Cross\r\n\u00a0A\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERACT\r\n\u00a0F\r\n\u00a0Square\r\n\u00a0X\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTIONS\r\n\u00a0Q\r\n\u00a0Circle\r\n\u00a0B\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVE CAMERA\r\n\u00a0Mouse\r\n\u00a0R1/L1/Right Analogue\r\n\u00a0RB/LB/Right Analogue\r\n\r\n\r\nPAUSE\r\n\u00a0Esc\u00a0Start\r\n\u00a0Start\r\n\r\n\r\nQUIT DEMO\r\n\u00a0Home + End\r\n\u00a0Start + Select\r\n\u00a0Start + Back\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nRecommendations\r\n<p>If possible, play this with a controller. KM+B will work just fine, but where's the fun in that. :(</p>\n<p>If you plan to play this on a CRT monitor, there is an extra ini setting you will likely require. If you go to <game folder=\"\">\\UPSXD\\Config\\DefaultGame.ini and scroll to the bottom, you will find a setting called <strong>CRTMode</strong>. If you set this to true, the pixelation post process will be disabled.</game></p>\n<p>If this is your first time running a game made in Unreal Engine, please go to\u00a0<game folder=\"\">\\Engine\\Extras\\Redist\\en-us for an exe that will install anything required by the engine to run.</game></p>\n\r\nAttributions:\r\n<p>http://www.freesfx.co.uk</p>\n<p>Menu Music: Acid Trance by Shane Ivers - https://www.silvermansound.com</p>\n<p>\"LowPoly character pipeline(Fear Effect 2 - Rain)\" (https://skfb.ly/6TsEo) by Henry VIII is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</p>\n<p>\"Lowpoly PS1 Basemesh Male, Unwrapped, Segmented\" (https://skfb.ly/6XVJQ) by BitHack is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</p>\n<p>Terminal Grotesque</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/681ba355593628611b413148b2a7e25c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Warwolf"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
