The good news was that an extremely talented coder named Rafael Garcia has written a point and click adventure engine, the Bladecoder Adventure Engine, complete with an intuitive editor, that runs on my preferred game framework, LibGDX. The bad news was that I couldn't find any decent free artwork to use for the game - so you get hand drawn squiggle-vision instead! </p><p>Code by me (and my dog): @RubyIsDog<br/>Music by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Created with Bladecoder Adventure Engine and LibGDX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/433/43399e4c288d21969d3063e6747bb9ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["adventuretron"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
