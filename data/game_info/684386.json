Keep moving! The monsters are fast but moving should help!<br/>2. Ready the bow when they are closing in!<br/>3. If you hear footsteps, look a bit up!<br/>4. If you hear cripply crawling sounds, look down!<br/>5. If you hear screaming, hold still and get ready to shoot whatever is coming!<br/>Bonus: Don't waste your arrows in the pumpkins, they are just for show!</p>\n<p>I might release a build that makes it a bit easier later</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T08:36:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e52/e5211b6d716f9fe735168e3f8af0ea8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Default"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
