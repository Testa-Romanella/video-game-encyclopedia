After enabling the expansion, you can continue to play The Quest with your existing character(s) to explore new areas and quests. However, if you don&amp;#39;t have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>Your ship has run off course, Hero. You find yourself sucked into a black hole that warps you far away. The world you know so well is gone. It&amp;#39;s as though there were a huge explosion. All around you the asteroids appear on fire. You feel great pain and pass out . You wake up in a strange room with an unearthly creature looking down on you.<br/><br/>The Asteroid Mage will send you on daunting missions - if you prove yourself worthy. If you survive her tests, you can fight tough monsters - join the miners&amp;#39; guild - mine minerals - smelt weapons and armor - cook a potion - clip a dragon&amp;#39;s toenails - mix cement - bag Red Mole Men for a bounty - trade vrauk horns - wield a laser sword - fall in love ... But, beware, Hero, there are perils everywhere, especially in the mines!<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select &amp;quot;Roids&amp;quot; as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 40 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion. Please note that after you have traveled to your destination, you&amp;#39;ll have no way back for a while (except if you have Marked a spot), so it is also recommended that you keep a save in Mithria.<br/><br/>The Quest - Escape from Asteroids has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/825/825821c8e09ed4ffcb3cf8692343ca46.jpeg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
