{"id": 736879, "slug": "horde-2", "name": "Horde?", "name_original": "Horde?", "description": "<p>Hi! This is a new game made by me! This game is all about surviving a horde of zombies. Simple but stressful! There are two types of zombies. 1. The regular zombie and 2 The shockers. The regular zombies are a slow breed of zombies that move very slowly. The shockers are the exact opposite of regular zombies and move very fast. Most suggested tactic \"Prioritize the shockers first than prioritizing the regular ones\". Shockers will play a special sound effect, indicating that they have spawned (Which has not been implemented yet and will be implemented in the future).\u00a0 The only weapon in the game is the FAL which can kill both the regulars and the shockers in one hit. There is a glock-18 which has no function just yet but is in the game files! Try the game and try to provide some feedback (All feedback is appreciated!).</p>\n<p>https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/571826518/\u00a0(Heres the browser version. Hassle free and all you need is... wifi...... shit) To be exact, the FAL is the L1A1 SLR (british version of the FAL)<br/></p>\n<p>Also sub to my devlog channel on YouTube (Thanks)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:45:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da5b5b14af923a9ec2788dc138c22e90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["milkbooooooiiiiii"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
