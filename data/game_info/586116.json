With moderate sized maps and 10 player servers this means the main game play is collecting weapons and surviving a harsh environment to get enough weaponry to take down other players and grow your economy. The game is completely free with optional cosmetics to support development if you enjoy the game. If you played classics such as day-z, war-z, or un-turned this game is heavily inspired by my love for the genre.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T03:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65dc9aa5a0971c88722a8f58c125ce56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeckbeardProductions"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NeckbeardProductions"], "esrb_rating": null}
