(V4NN)", "description": "<p>This is a very simple endless game.\u00a0The way to play is very easy, by avoiding long navy blocks and trying to take small white blocks as a score enhancer. If you touch the navy blocks, your point will be back to 0 and if you collect the small white blocks, it will give you +1 points.\u00a0The control is very simple, namely by tapping on your handphone screen / clicking left mouse button on your computer screen. I will update some features for this game, and then I will make a different games.\u00a0This game can be played on Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, Mac platforms (IOS platform not yet because I haven't downloaded the required assets). If you like the game pls support me by donating some of your\u00a0sustenance, Thank You :) and sorry for my bad English because this is not my native language.</p>\n<p>My Patreon :\u00a0<strong>https://www.patreon.com/V4NN</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T06:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/956/956b6d8c1e34ac295c386bd69de91cf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["V4NN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
