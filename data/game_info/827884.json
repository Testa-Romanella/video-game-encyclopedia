Most of our facilities that were invaded are built with Titanium walls, so these bullets ricochet a couple of times before it blasts. QuadraX trained special forces called Ricomen, to effectively use these ricocheting bullets. They are teleported to the invaded facilities, to procure data boxes that help us create more powerful weapons, that can annihilate the Aliens settlements.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Move : Arrow keys or ASDW / gamepad Lstick.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim : Mouse / gamepad Rstick.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Shoot : Left mouse click / gamepad Rtrigger.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Play : Left mouse click / Gamepad X or A.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reset : Left mouse click / Gamepad O or B.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Home : Click home button / Gamepad options.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T14:29:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/978/978665d5d6e111aa31e481adb12956a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Macrobeing"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
