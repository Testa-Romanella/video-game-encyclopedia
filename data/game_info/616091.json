The basic gameplay is the same; destroy enemies who are not your colour, and touch the ones who are the same colour to absorb their energy. Fill up your rainbow gauge to maximum, and unleash a beam to eliminate everything in your path!</p>\n<p>Here's a list of changes from the original:</p>\n<ul><li>Improved graphics thanks to the Pixel Spaceships asset pack (PIXEL SPACESHIPS (Shoot'em Ups Assets) [HD] by MedimonGames (itch.io))</li><li>100% more sound effects</li><li>Enemies will now shoot at you. The frequency increases as you advance</li><li>Enemy movement patterns added. More patterns unlock as you advance</li><li>Gamepad support</li><li>Added graphical effects</li><li>All enemies on screen are destroyed after completing a level, to give the player a breather</li></ul>\n<p>Overall, I'm very happy with how the game turned out, but the game also reminded me again how much work goes into creating even super small games. I wasn't even starting from scratch and the game still ended up being a lot of work!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programming and game design by me</li><li>Graphics by Medimon Games\u00a0https://medimongames.itch.io/\u00a0(particle effects were by me)</li><li>Music from the game Space Megaforce, a.k.a.
