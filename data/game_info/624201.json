So credit to that.</p>\n<p>Also credit to Depiik for teaching me how to make an fnf game.</p>\n<p>I usually use arrow keys, so to make it different for me, I made the controls WASD and I don't usually use that.</p>\n<p>Also, this was made on scratch, so just click on the green flag to play! Also, don't forget to fullscreen!</p>\n<p>I tried to shade it good, so tell me what you think in the comments.</p>\n<p>Anyways, enjoy my first game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:01:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f64/f645c353145f999f613395bdcae6a2f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Mason"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
