You probably won't get that far though, so don't worry.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f7/9f720bfc60d8c36fe3b0b2a57290e5f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mutant_llama1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
