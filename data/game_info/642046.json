Use flares (or your igniter, if you're desperate enough)\u00a0to light your way and rendezvous with your crew before it's too late!</p>\n<p>Assets from\u00a0kenney.nl\u00a0and\u00a0freesound.org.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my second game jam entry while I learn\u00a0Godot. I was interested to experiment with 2D lighting and tilemaps, although I wish I had had time to make the map more interesting, or even procedurally generated. Instead it ended up being a one-off single level game with no replayability, but I\u00a0can live with that.</p>\n<p>The first version was way too hard, so I added a \"map\" that appears after the initial interaction with your crew. It was worth the effort because I got to learn about cameras and viewports, and hopefully it makes it easier for the player\u00a0to figure out where to go. It's rough but functional, and I kind of like that it's a live zoomed-out view of the whole level (explained away as an \"aerial view,\"\u00a0of course).</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T05:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8e/d8efd78dc40769a6dd80d9fe05122160.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mtk4000"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
