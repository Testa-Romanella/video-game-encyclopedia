The contact between the director and the Hunan police was not smooth, but the other party reluctantly agreed to send a police officer to take a look at the scene. However, due to the recent theft of tombs and the frequent occurrence of strange phenomena near the tomb, the absolute security of the police cannot be guaranteed.<br/><br/>Liu Qingchun came to Changsha, Hunan, and the police arranged him to an archeological team. The leader was Lao Cui, who had been a few years old. At first glance, he returned to hire him for archeology. On the road, Lao Cui and Liu Qingchun said, \"You didn't come at the right time. The archeological site was closed. A few days ago, a group of grave robbers went wrong in the newly excavated cemetery No. 4. One came out, according to archeologists who had seen him This man was insane and insane. He cried when he saw someone. He said, \"It's over.\" They were the tombs of four people, and the whereabouts of the other three were unknown. They haven't come out yet. Later, I heard that they were excavated. A plague erupted at the scene. It is also strange that the local villagers were okay, but the archeological team were all sick, but when they were transferred to the Provincial People's Hospital, the disease was all right. Several large iron gates were blocked. You said that the incident of Zhang Zhenhua's tomb robbing should be the current location of No. 4 cemetery. The comrades in the bureau just said, if you have to go, do n\u2019t stop, send some other comrades Just wait outside the pit. \"<br/><br/>Liu Qingchun touched the bridge of his nose, pondered for a moment, and said, \"Go to No. 4 cemetery.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T02:49:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8f/c8f26638c4e8e4c55869995bf59901df.jpg", "website": "https://www.qzqstudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QZQ Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["H.P.Y.S,LLC"], "esrb_rating": null}
