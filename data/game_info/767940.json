Our results are our most important thing. Your unwilling participation, and expiration is deeply apreciated.</p>\n<p>Tech test is a prototype game, made solo by Mauricio Albanese,\u00a0for the ludumdare 50. based on the theme \"delkay the inevitable\".</p>\n<p>In TECH TEST a company has bringed a \"Voluntary subject\" to its company test grounds to try out the new mech's, weapon's and arsenal that they are developing in a flurry storm of metal, laser's and misile's. As TECH TEST logo say's your expiration is expected, and greatly apreciated. Drones and mechs wont stop spawning until you meet your inevitable fate, in fact they will increase in number's. all for the sake of TECH TEST.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROL'S:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>move: w,a,s,d</strong></p>\n<p><strong>shoot: left mouse button (LMB).</strong></p>\n<p>In TECH TEST your inevitable fate is met not by a timer. but by your own skill. You will die, but at your own pase. Your HP is linked to your controller's, each control is worth 2 hp. meaning that you have 10 hp. for each 2 hp you loose you will loose briefly the use of one of the control's. But if you survive long enoughyou can regain them again. This means that every time you loose a control and enemy's are greater in number will bring your expiration even sooner... all for the sake of TECH TEST result's.</p>\n<p>Have fun and good luck.</p><p>you can get the source code here:</p><p>https://github.com/mjad86/ludumdare50<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T04:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c59/c596d580943b31d5b3e84e8e2f4a358f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mauricio Albanese"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
