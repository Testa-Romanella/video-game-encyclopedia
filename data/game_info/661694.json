This is an old version of the game, it has many flaws\u00a0and there is a lot of things that would have been improved before considering it done. But it's better than nothing!<br/><br/>In the Tutorial, there are suppose to be\u00a0text which pops up when different tasks are completed, these disappeared when building the game for WebGL. The messages sent are the following:<br/>1. \"Press A to move to the left\"<br/>2. \"Press D to move to the right\"<br/>3. \"Good job!\"<br/>4. \"Avoid cars and jump over logs with Space\"<br/>Then when the player collides with a car the message \"Avoid hitting the cars\" are shown, and when colliding with the logs \"Jump over the logs with Space\".\u00a0<br/><br/> Also when the Tutorial ends, you can't (in this build) exit the Tutorial-scene which was fixed in a later version. There are also more problems like the \"HighScore\"-scene in this build being the same as the HighScore-scene shown at the end of a game-run (also fixed in a later version) and the HighScore itself not working properly, which I <br/>tried to make up for in a new very simpel game just to show that I can create a Highscore-system that works and have sounds connected to the gameplay, here is the link to that game:\u00a0https://ennell.itch.io/komplettering<br/><br/>My intention was of course to fix these problems\u00a0but couldn't because I no longer have access the project files.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T00:21:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb70c40742a81863cf334539b63a4e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ennell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
