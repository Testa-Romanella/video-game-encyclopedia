Most of the audio was also created during the jam, other than the ambiences, which are all contributions to the crowdsourced 'My Home' library, which Sam contributed to earlier in the pandemic. One of them was recorded by Sam in Exeter, and the others come from different parts of the globe.</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam was 'Strength Lies in Differences'.

I chose to represent these with lightbulbs.</p>\n\r\nTools\r\n<p>Made in Unity with Wwise audio middleware.</p>\n<p>Logic Pro and Pro Tools</p>\n<p>iZotope RX plug-ins</p>\n<p>Pen and Paper</p>\n<p>Oils on canvas</p>\n\r\nGameplay VideoMore on Generative Music", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:00:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e43/e4368b62c8111329238779bfadc75f31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samuel Hollywood-Summers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
