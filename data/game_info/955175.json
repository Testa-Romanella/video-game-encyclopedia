Each form allows you a distinct movement option, and you have to time your transformations as you play to be able to use these at the right times. Reach the flagpole at the end of the level to win, and get there as fast as you can to beat your record! Playable on keyboard or XBox controller.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Main menu music <ul><li>https://pixabay.com/music/beats-game-music-loop-2-144037/\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Controller button images <ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/free-keyboard-and-controllers-prompts-pack\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Keyboard buttons <ul><li>https://icons8.com/icon/set/computer-hardware/fluency\r\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T13:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edc/edc894fc64851e46e59cc6294ff8990c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["remivaughan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
