Maybe a bit too much.</strong></p>\n<p>This is my entry for Ludum Dare #40, where the theme was \"the more you have, the worse it is\". For this entry, you can consider the theme as in the main character has too many friends or simply too many feathers. I made this in about 5 hours on Monday after some, ah, technical difficulties\u00a0aka I dropped out of Ludum Dare on Saturday\u00a0but here's my entry! I hope you guys enjoy this rather short story.</p>\n<p><em>This was made in 5 hours on Twine 2. The background image is from Unsplash.
