The player will play a third party to decide which side to help.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 3 small levels in the game, namely kidney, lung and brain. At each level, we offer a limited number of drugs for players to make decisions.</p>\n<p>In the style of art, we chose the style of Micky and morty, trying to create a fantasy and grotesque feeling.</p>\n<p>Although the overall production is not mature enough, I hope you can have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:53:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/127cea06d679a794510e62934ac60b55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dongfangliu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
