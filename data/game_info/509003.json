Thus, you will have to\r\nplay on the official game, this is not a rom hack.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe\r\nsoftware will randomly associate a certain number of key items of the\r\ngame to different locations, called checks.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nTo make\r\nthe randomizer possible, a single number, called Seed, is generated\r\nupon launching a new game through the software. Each Seed is unique\r\nand corresponds to both: </p>\n<ul><li>\r\n\tThe\r\n\tplacement of a key item at a designated check\r\n\t</li><li>\r\n\tThe\r\n\tlist of hints that are provided to guide your run\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYour goal\r\nis to unlock all key items required, then defeat Ganon to beat the\r\ngame. Of course, the logic of the randomizer is made to ensure each\r\nseed can be completed.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAs you\r\nwill play on the original game and not on a rom hack, this software\r\nrelies on self-management. When starting a new run, all items will be\r\nforbidden to use. Each time a check is completed, you will have to\r\nnotify the software. It will thus be able to inform you of which item\r\nwas unlocked. Once a new item is unlocked and allowed to use, new\r\nchecks will be made accessible, allowing you to unlock more items\r\n(and so on). Again, more details will be provided later in this\r\nguide.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYou will\r\nbe able to keep track of items you unlocked through an inventory\r\nwindow. Checks completed and unlocked can also be followed via the\r\nHyrule map. The map is provided and updated by the software itself. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThis\r\nrandomizer can be either played alone or with other players in\r\ncooperation mode, so long as a connection is established between each\r\nplayer\u2019s computer. </p>\n<p>Don't hesitate to join this randomizer's community on Discord: https://discord.gg/qkeXZGv<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-23T22:24:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/225/2251a2d0486e7e578b7381a9de868442.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zarwaldo"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
