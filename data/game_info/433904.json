{"id": 433904, "slug": "city-soundscapes", "name": "City Soundscapes", "name_original": "City Soundscapes", "description": "<p>You are the mayor of a nice beach city. Unfortunately this location is very attractive to burglars and other \"nice\" people.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time you got to defend your city. But of course as a mayor you cannot go out on the streets to fight. Instead you send your police and you try to do everything you can to help defending the city center.</p>\n<p>In City Soundscapes you get control over a few roofs where you can build speakers (in fact line arrays) to play music all over the city.<br/>Humans of course like some music styles and dislike others. The bars above their heads are mood bars. If the mood of an intruder goes down to zero, he will flee and leave you (or your officers) alone.<br/>But beware! The intruders also like some styles of music. This will make their mood better. They will continue fighting you!</p>\n<p>Other way round your own personnel will get annoyed over time if you play the same music over and over. Switch styles in different parts of the city to keep them on a pleased level of entertainment.</p>\n<p>Other than for intruders, you can check the exact mood of your personnel.<br/>Simply click one of the heads of your policemen to see what styles of music they currently like. If one of the bars goes to zero, any beat they hear from this specific kind, will cause their mood to drop.<br/>\"Music tolerations\" recover automatically over time if the style isn't heard by the entity.</p>\n<p>If the mood of your policemen drops to zero, you will hear a cry and they will walk to the city center and stand near the fountain .<br/>If you want to recover them, click the fountain to open a special salary menu. It will cost quite a lot of money so watch out! It will further be more expensive, the more score you earn and also the more policemen to recover.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/><em>It's kind of a point and click game, so everything is controlled by using your mouse.</em></p>\n<ul><li>You can build line arrays on the roofs of some houses - look out for stages!</li><li>You can select a song to play, by clicking a line array.</li><li>You can recover policemen near the fountain by clicking it.</li><li>You can view the individual policemen music tolerations by clicking them (click the ground to hide)</li><li>Zoom in to show more detail (scroll wheel) - This might also help if you can't click entities!</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>\n<p>From time to time intruders as well as your policemen tell about their feelings by showing their thoughts in bubbles. Every green bubble is good for you. For enemies a green bubble means \u201cI hate this \u2026\u201d - A red bubble means \u201cI love this\u201d. But for your own entities a red bubble means \u201cI hate that mayor\u201d which means their mood drops.</p>\n<p>The small circle near the center of the screen shows the point where the sound scape in the top left corner is measured. It has no effect for the game.</p>\n<p>The distance of entities to the speaker within its range makes a difference of up to 25% on its effect</p>\n<p>Overlapping sound fields add up together up to 100%</p>\n<p><em>And sorry but we know that there are some glitches in the movement when there are many entities on a single point. That however doesn\u2019t affect the game flow. It\u2019s just graphical.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>WARNING<br/></strong>Mac and Linux builds are experimental and untested.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update Changelog</strong></p>\n<p>On 2020-04-21 we uploaded a bugfixed version that contains the following changes:</p>\n<ul><li>We accidentially left a debug value in the cost calculation for the recovery fountain. That has been fixed. This is the only \"game-changer\" in this bugfix.</li><li>We\u00a0 tweaked some settings that might increase performance drastically</li><li>We lowered the brightness of the sunlight a bit (we left this high for testing and forgot to turn it back low before build) for moodiness.</li><li>The Policemen did not spawn with full mood bars - this was implemented for testing purposes. This has also been fixed.</li><li>Made the policemen colliders a bit higher\u00a0 for easier clicking</li><li>Fixed the seam of the sand texture. That one looked ugly...</li></ul>\n<p>Sorry for the quite huge change list. This is uncommon for us but we had some major issues on the second day which did cost about\u00a0 5-6 hours and a medical issue on the third which costed additional 90 minutes of worktime so we weren't able to do any field tests during the jam...</p>\n<p>If you do not agree on those changes as a clean bugfix release, we left the original submission in the downloads. However, if you rate, tell us in the comments which version you played.<br/><em>Thanks for your understanding &lt;3</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T07:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/363afbf1a7547d3c3b3631c85c21d6ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Firesplash"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
