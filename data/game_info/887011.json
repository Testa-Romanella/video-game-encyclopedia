Drop the\u00a0cards on eachother to combine them. Not all cards combine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T08:53:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dde/ddeb9218dffa44a2b9c3ef393c217f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Samet Hope"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
