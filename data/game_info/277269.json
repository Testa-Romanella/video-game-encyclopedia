The game can be played with as many categories as you like. You have 40 seconds, or until the first person is finished. The answers are written on paper, and read out after each round. People who share the same answer, get 5 points each, and people who have a unique answer get 10! If you couldn't think of an answer, you sadly don't get any points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins!\u00a0The game has no player limit, so it is ideal for a family game night, or when you just need something to play.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Letter: N</p>\n<p>Stadt(City) - New York</p>\n<p>Land(Country) - Nigeria</p>\n<p>Fluss(River) - Nile</p>\n<p>Antworten(Answers) are going to be added to the game shortly, so you can look up some of the more popular answers offline. I am always open to suggestions on how to improve my games, so feel free to send me an Email! I hope this application makes playing a little bit easier, and have fun!</p>\n\n<p>- Will</p>\n<p>Email:</p>\n<p>OpenDoresGaming@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cdd50db6d0ba77e3ae0ac3e0f13c556.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["OpenDoresGaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
