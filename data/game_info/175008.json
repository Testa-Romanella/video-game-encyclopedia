You play the part of Smiling Bear who wants to make sad faces happy by shooting at them with pink hearts. There are different levels with varying degrees of difficulty.</p><p>I designed this game with my kids. I made it for many reasons. To introduce a passion of mine to them. To get them excited about being creative. Perhaps most importantly just to have fun.</p><p>My family had the wonderful idea to share it with the world.</p>All this work was done by your family?<p>You bet! My family and I did all the art work, and I built the game. The music is done by my brother who happens to do this sort of thing professionally!
