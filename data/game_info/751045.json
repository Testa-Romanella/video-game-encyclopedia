I say that, but I've been working on it for ~6 months.\u00a0 Expect bugs or\u00a0 not fully fleshed out features. The bones are there though, so if you like the bones, let me know.</p>\n<p>There is no story to this game, you load an arena and survive for as long as you can. You can find an arsenal of spells throughout the arena, leveling them up and swapping loadouts to slaughter the ever-growing mass of enemies.\u00a0It doesn't matter how long you survive, only how many enemies you take down with you.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Controls are currently keyboard and mouse only, but controller support is planned</p>\n<ul><li>W, A, S, D\u00a0 to move</li><li>Shift to sprint<br/>\n</li><li>Spacebar to jump</li><li>Mouse to rotate character</li><li>Left click to cast the equipped spell</li><li>Right click switches to aiming mode, with a reticle appearing to help target</li><li>1, 2, and 3 switch between spells on your spell bar</li><li>1, 2, and 3 also purchases spells and equips them to the corresponding bar</li></ul>\r\nEnemies\r\n<p>This game will have a variety of units, spawning in increasing numbers and increasing varieties the longer a player survives. Different arenas will have different enemies in each of the 7 classes available. The 7 classes will be divided as follows:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Infantry - Kobolds:</strong> Fodder units</li><li><strong>Ranged - Goblins:</strong> Fodder units that attack from afar</li><li><strong>Heavy Infantry - Hobgoblins:\u00a0</strong>Meaty units that hit hard and move slow</li><li><strong>Berserker - Werewolves:\u00a0</strong>Heavy hitters that move fast and go down faster *Not Spawning*</li><li><strong>Cavalry - Chimeras:\u00a0</strong>Large units with a variety of attacks *Not Spawning*</li><li><strong>Siege - Golems:\u00a0</strong>Very slow, very tanky, long reach *In Development*</li><li><strong>Boss - TBD:\u00a0</strong>Special Attacks and Special Stats *In Planning*</li></ul>\r\nIn The Future\r\n<p>This is an ongoing project, with features planned and in the works. I started this project as way to test my ability to integrate Asset Workshop bundles and stretch my skills as a coder.\u00a0\u00a0Some planned features will be dependent on player interest, while others will be implemented by me to continue my practice. If you have any suggestions, feel free to leave them in the comments.\u00a0This is supposed to be a power fantasy game, so go crazy.</p>\n<strong>Feature</strong><strong>Description</strong><strong>Stage</strong>Working SettingsThe settings are just for show at the moment.
