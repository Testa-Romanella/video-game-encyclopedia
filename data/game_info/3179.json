It was developed by British Media Molecule studio who before LPB developed only one semi-experimental game Ragdoll Kung-Fu. The game tells a story about the adventures of Sackboy, but there is no actual plot to follow in the game. The main focus is on the gameplay.</p>\n<p>The game bets on user-generated-content and invites everyone to add something of their own to it. Each new level is a new story, and the ability to create your own levels with the built-in editor greatly increases the time spent playing. You can go through the game alone or with your friends: on one console or using online services.</p>\n<p>In addition to the level editor, players can customize the Sackboy to their taste. In the creation of costumes for the main character of the game participated other developers: for example, Supermassive Games, Fireproof Games, Tarsier Studios.</p>", "metacritic": 95, "released": "2008-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T22:00:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c32/c32fd6c512c48b3e2f10686a6e06690d.jpg", "website": "http://www.littlebigplanet.com", "rating": 4.09, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 1575, "beaten": 460, "toplay": 56, "dropped": 213, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 66, "ratings_count": 542, "suggestions_count": 492, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 544, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Media Molecule", "Fireproof Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
