You must collect healing potions constantly to stay alive, while still collecting as much loot as possible.</p>\n<p>Created for My First Game Jam Summer 2022.</p>\n<p>By the way, I (the developer) am completely aware that this game, in its current state, is not in a finished state at all. The gameplay is an unbalanced mess, the artwork leaves much to be desired, and overall the game lacks features and polish. I plan to work much more on this game in the future, but for now, I need to have something to submit to the game jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:58:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cb4e029e2419a00015f9de92d1279e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HatchGreenChili"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
