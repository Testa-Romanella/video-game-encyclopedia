What does that even mean, you ask?\r\n                        Well it means, that we bring together the best out of two worlds. One player plays a shoot 'em up, while the other one plays an jump and run! You are reliant on each other. So practically speaking, the one can't survive without the other. That principle is mirrored in the gameplay. If one of you dies, the game ends and you have to restart!\r\n                        So grab a buddy and dive in heads first!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T02:24:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/618100a8a33c636520fe3abf966523e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["himamori"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
