How far are we from the Sun? What does it feel like to be inside a nebula? You can now find, from your own perception, the answers to these questions.<br/><br/><strong>Much more than a documentary, OVERVIEW is an immersive real-time simulation tested with astronauts in zero-gravity flights. It is the journey to the stars we have all dreamed of.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-24T06:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f3863d53f4cc248777b4a0868589486a.jpg", "website": "http://www.orbitalviews.com/overview/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orbital Views"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Orbital Views"], "esrb_rating": null}
