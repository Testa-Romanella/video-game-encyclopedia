For this : a fake \" Le Monde \" article on a researcher having transferred his dead wife's consciousness into a computer program. The program simulates an artificial intelligence named Mary with whom the player meets. He is free to choose his answers and \u201cMary\u201d will answer accordingly. To help him progress in the adventure, the player can use the information in the article, allowing him to obtain new dialogues. The experience allows us to observe a dystopian situation in the face of the suffering of an artificial intelligence becoming aware of its situation of being both living and non-living. This project was the first mixing narration and interactivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Warning : This game is getting old, many bugs and faults are no longer correctable.
