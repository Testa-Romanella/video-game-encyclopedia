You can put it in any free (gray) place, simply touching the destination slot. <br/><br/>Once you have placed your piece in the target place, if in some of the adjacent places there are blue pieces with lower numbers, they will automatically be changed to red.<br/><br/>Then the adversary's turn comes, and he will put a blue randomly numbered piece in a free place of his choice. <br/><br/>And if there are red pieces with lower values in the adjacent places, they will be changed to blue, and so on.<br/><br/>When the board is full, red and blue pieces are counted. If the red pieces are more than the blue ones, then you win, otherwise you lose.<br/><br/>Hit the Restart button at any time to start a new game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a7/8a76cf71195ee971cd37ca307f397201.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "esrb_rating": null}
