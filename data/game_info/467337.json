Unlike traditional survival games, Mean Screen removes the player's ability to control the screen (which normally follows the player around). Instead, the camera pushes you ever onward to the right. If you lag behind, you'll be destroyed!</p>\n<p>Construct barricades to slow down your encroaching doom. Build better tools that last longer and allow you to\u00a0mine faster. Discover new crafting recipes, and\u00a0find more valuable ore to construct sturdier objects and stay ahead of the screen!</p>\n<p>See if you have what it takes to go toe-to-toe with this crazy side-scrolling adventure!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Intense single-player gameplay</li><li>Simple &amp; intuitive crafting recipes</li><li>Responsive controls</li><li>Controller support in addition to traditional keyboard &amp; mouse</li><li>Easy to follow tutorial</li><li>High blood pressure\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls (Keyboard &amp; Mouse)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move with WASD</li><li>Break blocks with SPACE or E</li><li>Place blocks or drop items with Q</li><li>Select inventory slots with mouse scroll wheel or digits 1 - 5</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls (Game Controller)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move with left analog stick</li><li>Break blocks with primary button (typically A)</li><li>Place blocks or drop items with secondary button (typically B)</li><li>Select inventory slots with L / R triggers or shoulder buttons</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Developer Thoughts</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This was my first time participating in a game jam and while my brother has some experience in video game development, I had next to none. Both of us found this to be a very rewarding\u00a0- albeit stressful at times - experience, and I am personally looking forward to participating next year. Huge shout out to GMTK for making this possible. Please leave feedback for any ideas on what could have made this a better gaming experience.\u00a0Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:07:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b28/b2812662bf03fb110b478789d861f59b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["littlehawk93"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
