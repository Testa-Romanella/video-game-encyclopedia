Let's help it successfully receive water together. In the game, we need to draw lines to guide water into the water cup to pass the level. Drawing lines requires ink, and the less used, the higher the star rating. <br/>\r\nNote that you can use fixed objects around you to maintain the position of the line segment.<br/>\r\n The entire game has almost only two shades of blue and white, and the characters and scenes are also outlined with extremely simple lines.<br/>\r\n Simplicity exudes a sense of mystery and looks unique. With beautiful graphics, elegant music design, and simple yet compact operation, the game can bring players a very relaxed gaming experience.
