This is the most basic attack.</li><li><em>Lightning</em>: Hits enemies and connects to nearby ones for fast kills and possible large group kills. \u00a0DOWNSIDE: If the enemies are too close the character the lightning can connect to and hurt him too.</li><li><em>Tidal Wave</em>: Launches a massive Tidal Wave across the map. \u00a0Has a lethal zone where enemies within it will die (that the player is aiming). \u00a0DOWNSIDE: The wave leaves behind a splash that blocks enemies and can push the player which can make things chaotic.</li><li><em> Tornado</em>: Creates a vortex that moves somewhat randomly killing and flinging enemies around. \u00a0DOWNSIDE: The tornado can not only run into the player if placed poorly but can also fling enemies closer to the player.</li><li><em> Elemental Storms</em>: Two slow moving storms of fire and ice that decimate enemies. \u00a0DOWNSIDE: If they come in contact with the player the player gets heavily pushed aside and takes heavy damage.</li><li><em>Black Hole</em>: Sucks enemies towards the center of the black hole, smashing them together and killing them. \u00a0DOWNSIDE: Also affects the player.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><em>Random Attack</em>: Quickly fires a random elemental attack with a short cooldown. \u00a0Attacks move at the same speed to help players aim.
