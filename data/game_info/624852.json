Just like our inspiration, the game is a slapstick-stealth-sandbox.<br/><br/>Gnome Gname was developed over 9 weeks\u00a0as our graduation project at The Game Assembly in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. <br/><br/>We hope you have as much fun playing it as we had making it!</strong><br/><br/><br/>Disclaimer: We have had some issues with getting the game to work on certain computers, specifically if you use an AMD graphics card.
