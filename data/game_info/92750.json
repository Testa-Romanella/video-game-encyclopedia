It was created solely for the purpose of learning Unreal Engine 4.</p><p>When I started, I had only the very basic knowledge of how the engine works (watched/completed only few tutorials for beginners). After slightly over a month of almost non-stop reading/watching tutorials and trying things out in the editor I ended up with the game you see in front of you. It's nothing super fancy, but I think it's pretty OK for something done by a complete noob, who never done anything in the UE4 or other engine of similar magnitude.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0d/a0d1a8bc92a52577478558bb37963045.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KorinOo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
