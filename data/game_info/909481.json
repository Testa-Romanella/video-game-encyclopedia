One you press the left mouse button, your gun will fire once per second on its own. When you step past the initial spawn room, your aim will follow a set point around the room. Try to hit as many targets as you can in what I have aimed to be a sort of inverted version of your usual rail shooter. While they normally control your movement and let you fire and aim by yourself, this does the opposite.\u00a0</p><p>Note that after 60 seconds you should get control of your aim back, so feel free to have an easier look around the firing range and see how many targets you had left.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:55:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ac/8ac255c7599bb71ed27fe7d830aece2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["riceby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
