{"id": 24795, "slug": "blades-of-steel", "name": "BLADES OF STEEL", "name_original": "BLADES OF STEEL", "description": "With stick in hand and confidence brimming, you are looking to bring \n      home the cup, win the MVP award, get on the covers of major sports \n      magazines and date a beautiful model (not necessarily in that order). \n      But soon you will learn that, in this league, nothing is ever given to \n      you, and before you can reach your goals, you'll have to put the puck in \n      the net and score some. You'll need both the artful skills of a finesse \n      player and the bone-crushing brutality of an enforcer. Defend your own \n      goal against unrelenting power plays, or put the pressure on your \n      opponent's goalie and try a slap shot of your own. Don't forget to \n      defend yourself when anger flares because the gloves come off and fists \n      start flying. So strap on blades of steel and prepare to either make a \n      name for yourself or be put on ice.\n    <p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
