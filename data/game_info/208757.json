The purpose was to create a simple platform game, but since I know how to code, I needed a challenge. So I created this skilled based game. During the production, I went to a birthday party and asked the DJs to record the performance and send it to me to be the soundtrack of the game.</p>\n\n\r\n-&gt; Special Thanks\r\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0- Jo\u00e3o Garcia (Iguana Garcia)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Spotify</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Bandcamp<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Facebook</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0- Jo\u00e3o Moreira\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/141/1415af79964cde5a0712cfd24e4a2084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jerg33"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
