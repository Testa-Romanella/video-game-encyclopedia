I really want to see some speed runs on this game, this is my first ever 3d unity game so there might be some bugs, but you can still find your fun in the \"BUGS\"!</p><p>If you still don't have the ideas of the controls you can read on from here. the controls are basically WASD but the W key is the north direction of the map, and the S is the south direction of the map, and the A is the west direction while D is the east direction. so you should keep that in mind. there is also a space key in the game. the space key will allow u to infinitely jump which means that you will \"FLY\"!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T11:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e3/5e3bffd1b8bff7189c6f6562c4c866b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["NightmareOlogy"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
