Place explosives together to create stronger explosions. Every object has HP, and some objects are more sturdy than others, which means you will need more explosives to blow it up.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created by @Krazune, and @IndieWafflus, in 7 days, for the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions<br/></strong></p>\n<p>A dynamite <em>(Q)</em> is used to detonate <em>(E + Click)</em> barrels <em>(1)</em>, gas <em>(2)</em> and boxes <em>(3)</em>.</p>\n<p>By spawning a dynamite and clicking to detonate <em>(left mouse button on the detonator)</em>, a timed explosion will be set and the dynamite will explode after a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Exploding something close to another explosive <em>(such as barrels)</em> will create another explosion, meaning you can create a chain of explosions if explosives are close enough to each other.</p>\n<p>Explosives can explode only after a few seconds if they were within radius of another explosive <em>(when they explode)</em> but not too close to it.</p>\n<p>When an explosive explodes, it will go back to your inventory so that you can use it again.<br/></p>\n<p>You start with one free barrel and one free dynamite. By destroying objects in the map <em>(some objects are sturdier than others, thus more difficult to destroy)</em> you will be rewarded with cash. You can open the shop <em>(B)</em> to increase the limit of explosives you can hold and spawn.</p>\n<p>You can move around using the <em>(W A S D)</em> keys and your mouse to look around. You can also jump <em>(space)</em>, crouch <em>(ctrl)</em> and sprint <em>(left shift)</em>.</p>\n<p>By pressing <em>(F)</em> you will be set into the <em>(Free Camera)</em> mode, in which you can use the same keys to move around. <em>(Space) </em>will be used to move up and <em>(Ctrl)</em> to move down, while <em>(Left Shift)</em> is used to move faster. Pressing <em>(F)</em> again will leave the <em>(Free Camera)</em> mode and teleport you back to where you were when you got into the\u00a0<em>(Free Camera)</em>.</p>\n<p>You win when every object in the island is destroyed.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Notes<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The game currently has no Save &amp; Load system, as well as no settings adjustments.</p>\n<p>We recommend that you download the executable files, since the WebGL version has worse performance.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Skybox is from the Fantasy Skybox Free Asset.</p>\n<p>Sand texture is from Tileable Pack 01 Free Asset.<br/></p>\n<p>Song is \"Sea Shanty 2\", belongs to Runescape, and was created by Ian Taylor.</p>\n<p>Water shader was created by following the 3D Stylized Water with Refraction and Foam Shader Graph - Unity Tutorial from Binary Lunar on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Explosion particles effect was created by following the Unity - VFX - Toon/Anime Explosion Tutorial from WuzzyWizard on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Public source code</strong></p><p>All the files from the Unity project are available at the GitHub Repository.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/925/9251fb1e1ac204a29118e2bae4713338.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["krazune", "Wafflus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
