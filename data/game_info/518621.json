{"id": 518621, "slug": "impavidvm", "name": "IMPAVIDVM", "name_original": "IMPAVIDVM", "description": "is a physics based platformer with puzzle solving components where you have to overcome increasingly complex obstacles, testing your abilities and observation skills.<br/><br/><br/>You cannot jump again in mid-air, you cannot fall from 10 meters and hope to live. You will not acquire mysterious powers by accumulating points and leveling up. Do you want to jump? You will need a support foot and momentum. After all you are just a person, right? So throw off your super hero cloak... in <strong>IMPAVIDVM</strong>'s world, it will not help you!<br/><br/><br/>You are trapped in a giant fortress, seemingly for no reason. Your initial goal is to find a way out, but over time you will begin to feel the need for explanations. \"Why am I here? How did I get here? Who trapped me? What is this building, and why does it look so obvious that it's testing me? Is there anyone else here, or am I alone? Am I being watched? Is this a conspiracy against me?\"<br/><br/><br/>Make your way through the fortress and search for answers. They will eventually come, but you may not like what you hear.  <strong>IMPAVIDVM</strong> is not a fast experience, but it is precise, and it is fair. It is a game of pace and precision, specifically designed for players who like to perfect their technique over time, but not to be so punitive as to be frustrating for those who prefer to play without stress and enjoy the discovery of the plot.<br/><br/>At the end of the first play through, options specifically designed for speed runners will unlock. The game will help you perfect your technique with an internal timer and verbose statistics to help you understand where you can improve, what you did right, and what you did wrong.<br/><br/>Finishing the game requires moderate effort. Finishing it as quickly as possible will be a challenge to the very last frame.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T02:13:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f1/1f1ac2c220848d9206fd31e56e56adf9.jpg", "website": "https://www.pimarkgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 390, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PiMark Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PiMark Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
