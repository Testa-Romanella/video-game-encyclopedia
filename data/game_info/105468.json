This is a collection of 15 games made over the past 5 years by indie game developer FlashChaz &amp; friends!</p>\n<p>As the sun sets on Flash and methods of delivering web games change, I wanted to honour my time making Flash games by packing up my favourite releases from the past\u00a0 5 years into one handy collection! <br/></p>\n<p>I thought <strong>The Skeleton Key </strong>would be a really nice way to cap off what has been a huge part of my life over the years; aside from the games themselves I have packaged up videos for games that never made the cut, prototypes for game ideas I had, soundtracks for the games and other various music bits I've made, a cute little Infodex.pdf with some tips on the collected games and other little bits and bobs that might be of interest to you!</p>\n<p>I am hoping to eventually update the games to have no branding or adverts in but this is a little tricky for a few reasons; when it happens you can be sure the collection will be updated! (As well as any additional content I come across I feel is relevent to the collection!)<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Whether you're familiar with my games or are just discovering them, I'm sure there's something here for everyone.<br/></p>\n<p><em>All donations are most welcome and are ploughed straight back into doing what I\u00a0 love...making games!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ed/2edcd18468c3b61734f35b69d645dad6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FlashChaz"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
