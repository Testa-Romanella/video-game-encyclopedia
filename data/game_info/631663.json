Just like your favorite childhood toys but without any limits of physics, space, or time.<br/></p><p>IncrediMarble is a fairly straight-forward, physics-based idle/incremental game. You build plastic slides, earn money rolling marbles through them, then spend the money upgrading and building more slides! Creativity can lead to better earnings but it's really just nice to sit back and be mesmerized by the marbles rolling around.\u00a0The game is technically still in Early Access, as I have been fixing bugs and adding features while trying to ensure all three desktop platforms are running smoothly. The game also has Twitch integration, allowing your stream audience to place their names on marbles set up for racing.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong>DLC for the itch.io version is available here! Do not try to purchase through the in-game prompt!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:03:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48a/48a738bc8de7bd7779a1706e34779d9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DaveKap"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
