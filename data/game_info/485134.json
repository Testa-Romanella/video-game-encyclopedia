They have many strange requirements for their new homes: some have an affinity for pollution others have a taste for colder temperatures and piles of Woolyfant leftovers. To each their own. You have been contracted to Climaform these worlds. Flying between asteroids and planets with your crew of Rebots, you will explore an ecosystem of wacky plants and animals. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach alien race has specific requirements for habitats, meaning you need to transform and design ecosystems, while dealing with the local wildlife, and potential sentient beings that might not condone your lease on the land. You are basically changing the climate of existing ecosystem, so you experience first-hand the effects of climate change and migration.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSetting up loops to process resources will enable you to alter the very atmosphere around you and deal with the consequences!  To make your robots work, you need to program them. Or rather, you need to instruct your robot managers to instruct your robots workers. Hence, you learn how to program by creating your code and instructions directly in the world and seeing your robot operation automatically carrying out your carefully designed program in real time. You will feel the power of changing the environment and discover the mysteries of this robotic Galaxy. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe levels are both handcrafted and procedurally generated using adventure graphs, creating diverse challenges tailored to you and your preferences. This creates endless yet diverse adventures for every mission.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T22:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/beb/beb16321a1771127a095553ee01f0812.jpg", "website": "https://www.rebotsgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlatPonies"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FlatPonies"], "esrb_rating": null}
