It was built using Godot Engine v3.3, and all art and code was done by Sam Bigos.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong>: Move - your fleet will follow your lead.</li><li><strong>Left Mouse</strong>: Command your fleet to shoot towards the mouse cursor. Note: Fighters will not friendly-fire! After shooting, they will back off while reloading to allow others to shoot.</li><li><strong>Right Mouse</strong>: Hold to enter 'shotgun' formation. This aligns your fleet in a narrower line which allows more to fire at once. It is also helpful for avoiding enemy fire.</li><li><strong>K</strong>: Toggle between window sizes (960x540, 1920x1080, fullscreen).</li></ul>\n<p>You will encounter waves of enemies, after defeating each wave, you will be able to choose a perk which upgrades your fleet.</p>\n<p>Survive as long as you can!<br/></p>\r\nLinks\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Features these music tracks:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Metre - Taranis</strong></li><li><strong>Visager - The Great Tree</strong></li></ul>\r\nFont\r\n<p>The font used is <strong>Fibberish by Caffinate</strong>.</p>\r\nOther\r\n<ul><li>Follow me on <strong>Twitter</strong>.<br/>\n</li><li>Source on my <strong>Github</strong>.\r\n</li><li>More of my stuff on <strong>Itch.io</strong>.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:42:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afe0e3db63bb6250b1f1b182152709cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Sam Bigos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
