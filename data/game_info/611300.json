While moving through this world you must destroy blinking, disruptive roots that are burdening your path and the space around you.\u00a0Sometimes these roots spawn new life, and sometimes a human, Charlie, appears. As you play through, the world will gradually saturate and life will begin to populate around you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is your choice if you do\u00a0or do not want to engage with Charlie's story as she walks through the forest.<br/><br/>To play, use <strong>WASD to move</strong> through the space and <strong>click the left mouse button</strong> to swing your arm. You can move slightly faster by <strong>holding Shift</strong>.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T08:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15a/15a48c796a484703f0a99d693cae703a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jes Klass"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
