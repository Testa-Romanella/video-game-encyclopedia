To do this, you need to first crush the ore rocks with a hammer, sweep out the rubble with a broom and heat up the useful ore into ingots with a flame.</p><p>Select a tool from the top: hammer, broom or flame, then click the ore to process it. Each type of ore needs to be processed a different number of times with each tool.</p><p> You gain score when ingots reach the end of the belt. For every 3 delivered ingots a new type of ore unlocks, the recipe unlocks when you successfully make and deliver an ingot made from it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa3/fa3fa554ea3996f5a5b209edfc8c3cc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["LiamLime"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
