The game doesn't have a save feature, yet. There's a basic save, more or less half way the adventure,\u00a0 so the player is not punished too hard in case \"something goes wrong\". This save, however, is only for the current playthrough. Whenever you quit the game and start a new one from the main menu, you will always start at the beginning.</p>\n<p>Bugs: I think the game is more or less bug free, if you encounter one, it will probably be getting stuck somewhere (there's a lot of furniture in the game, and maybe I missed some spots). If that's the case, you'll have to restart the game. I apologize in advance for that. Contact me if you find one, and I will fix it asap.<br/></p>\n\n<p>***Graphic settings***</p>\n<p>Because it's my first game i didn't plan beforehand the separation of persistent data with different map zones, to be able to load separatedly. This means the whole chapter is loaded into a single scene, wich runs till the end. However I put a lot of effort into optimization, and thanks to aggressive occlusion, and according to the testings, game runs fine in graphic cards like nVidia GTX 960 and even older ones. There's 3 graphic settings you can change pressing F1-F3 at runtime. Being F1 \"High\" and F3 for low spec PCs. Default setting is high.\u00a0</p><p>***Complete walkthrough***</p><p>BEWARE OF SPOILERS</p><p>If you don't have enough PC or enough time to play, you can watch the entire walkthrough of the game here:</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T21:10:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af3c85e0093f65c65494b77db0e3c144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kitsune Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
