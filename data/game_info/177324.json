When you move, your shots (and the enemies!) move. Beware.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To shoot, use the button in the center of the arrow buttons and select where to shoot at\u00a0</p>\n<p>(<em>Tip</em>:\u00a0Instead of clicking the arrow buttons,\u00a0you can use the arrow keys to move!)<br/></p>\n<p>Enemies have 3 hp. You have only one.</p>\n<p>Kill every enemy and collect every item drop to get to the next enemy wave.</p>\n<p>Try to survive 5 waves (and all the bugs too).</p>\n<p><em>Note:\u00a0While making it, we really like the idea of offsetting shots from tile centers. We think the whole thing could be really interesting to explore (add more shot modifiers, level your shot stats, enemy variety, etc.)\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>#7drl is an amazing experience everyone!</p>\n<p><em>Credits:</em></p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0Fernando Mart\u00ednez Ruppel</p>\n<p>Game Design and Development:\u00a0@NicoSaraintaris</p>\n<p><strong>Superhotlike</strong> is a small\u00a0#7drl game by Beavl.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03d63c398831bd8f6230d9946dd9a748.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Beavl"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
