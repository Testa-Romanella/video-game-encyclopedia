Queen Ella's intelligence and cunning has caused the kingdom to flourish in ways it never has in generations passed. However, this rendered the king as an accessory to the throne, confidence in his authority gone, and that's not even the worst part.</p><p>Four years after their marriage, while the two are seen to be getting ready for the Annual Grand Ball that will happen on the Friday of November 13th, King Idris gets a prediction a week prior that a tragedy will occur on the same day.</p>Author's Notes:<br/>- This game is meant to be a submission to My First Game Jam of Winter 2019. I intended for the demo to be longer but a lot of shenanigans in school, and code breaking came up.<br/>- This was very loosely inspired by Cinderella but in the perspective of the prince after they've been married. I've seen many complain about the tale of Cinderella which was the story of a woman who waited for her prince charming to save her to get out of a bad situation. I have incorporated that here in my characterization of Ella.<br/>- Now, having brought up Cinderella, I pose the question: \"Is it really a smart idea to marry a girl you just met?\" Then every way this decision Cinderella's made could possibly backfire came to mind and I thought this would be an interesting perspective to write from.Demo Features<p>- Original CGs, BGs, and Sprites</p><p>- About 2000+ words</p><p>- Four character appearances</p><p>- Prologue Only</p>What to expect for the Full Game<p>- Total of eight characters</p><p>- 3-4 routes</p><p>- Minimum Word Count Target: 50,000 words</p><p>- Seven endings with variants (Subject to change)</p><p>- Tentative Release Date: June 2019</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T04:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8a453be0fa8cff954dfcb093211640f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skai2blue4u"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
