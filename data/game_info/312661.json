You should check it with this game! DELIVERED! is an addictive logical game where you have to divide your attention and concentrate on many things in the same time to successfully finish the levels! There are two game modes, ten levels and three difficulty levels in the early access version which guarantees many hours of fun (and sweat :) )!The storyYou are a clerk in a parcel delivery company and your job is to dispatch the packages from the storage to the trucks. This sounds easy at first but the smallest mistake and you found yourself in a big mess! The complexity of the levels increasing as the game advances, but don't worry, as you playing the game, your reflexes and concentration ability will be better and better! The primary game mode was so intense that I implemented a secondary (the popular color matching) one with a more relaxing gameplay. If you finish a level, you can replay that level anytime, without restarting the whole campaign.The funIntense gameplay and very nice music which adds a lot to the mood! Additionally, with the built-in level editor you can easily modify the existing levels or you should create completely new ones!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/738b41a0c73d7a925fed4e13150668e8.jpg", "website": "http://railcatgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rail Cat Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rail Cat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
