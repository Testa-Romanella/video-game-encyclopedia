Living aboard makeshift flying cities has made humans reliant on scrap: parts of machinery that are consistently recycled to repair necessary systems such as engines, weapons, and air filtration systems. However it is occasionally necessary to build something new, especially amidst desperate circumstances. K.I.N. is the story of a newly built robot aboard the airship New Dawn, and things aren\u2019t clearly as they should be. Venture through the recesses of New Dawn on a journey in discovering purpose and self identity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T05:00:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a6/7a61cc253656f69e4a5701d997691d0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Windreda", "koopastroopa", "Cplshephard", "Gonellicon4", "JLawless", "Hazedoron", "Zhakyria"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
