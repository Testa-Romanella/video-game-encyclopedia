{"id": 70727, "slug": "classic-ludo-offline-online", "name": "Classic Ludo Offline & Online", "name_original": "Classic Ludo Offline & Online", "description": "Ludo is a strategy board game for 2 to 4 players and is being widely played in India, Nepal, Algeria and many Asian, Latin, European countries. It is also called as Parchisi, Parcheesi, and Laadhuu. The goal is simple, each player has to race their four tokens from start to finish (home) according to rolls of a single die or dice.<br/><br/>DESIGN<br/><br/>You got classic wood and neo-Ludo boards (paper &amp; white). The wood board, die &amp; tokens are a timeless design. It gives you a better visual experience and nostalgic feelings. The sketch marks and crystal clear tokens will make us feel the same old classic ludo board.<br/><br/>The board is the square shape with 3 columns of squares and supports up to 4 players (2, 3 &amp; 4 players in combination with Computer). Each player will take one color from bright yellow, green, red and blue. You can also assign all players as Computer and quietly watch each, it is quite a lot fun. :)<br/><br/>DIE ROLLING<br/><br/>I built an entirely new physics engine for die-rolling mechanics that will simulate the real-time rolling of a die or dice. The physics behind die-rolling was very challenging and I am proud to be the first one to implement. This will make it look like a 3D Ludo game.<br/><br/>SETTINGS<br/><br/>It has an extensive set of game settings. You can play a match in 100s of variations to favor your own country rules. Some of them include,<br/><br/>Star Squares (safer)<br/>Barrier Squares (Squares that will stop opponents to pass by)<br/>Home Squares (Entering without returning opponent tokens)<br/>Magic No (Die result that makes a staged token to enter its starting square)<br/>Token Moving &amp; Die Rolling Speed<br/><br/>OFFLINE<br/><br/>Options to play with one or more Computer or Players or combination. You can also choose the intelligence of Computer (Trained, Expert and Strategic) to increase the complexity level.<br/><br/>ONLINE<br/><br/>Play with your friends, family or a random player across the world by logging into Game Center / Facebook or as anonymous. You have options to invite your friends or join a match hosted by your facebook and Game Center friends. You can see your total wins &amp; your rank in Global Leaderboards. There are several achievements to unlock in the kingdom of Ludo.<br/><br/>You can also emote your tokens, and message with your opponents while playing the match.<br/><br/>GAME AI<br/><br/>The AI behind the game is built, by keeping-in-mind that the outcome of dice is always random and unpredictable whether it is thrown by player or Computer. Computer's intelligence is only to decide which tokens to choose from and to return the opponent's tokens from its squares or not. It doesn't have any control over the outcome/result of the die or dice.<br/><br/>OTHERS<br/><br/>Player Names &amp; Colors - Can be manually decided<br/>Last Played Match - You can quit the game and play from where you left last time<br/>Game Instructions &amp; Help - Helps you to follow the match easily<br/>Multi-color dies - One can easily understand who's turn is current<br/>Decide - Before returning your opponent's tokens in your square<br/>Real-time die feature - You can have a die or dice on your hand, and toss it. The outcome can be fed back to the game.<br/>and much more.<br/><br/>Please leave us your valuable feedbacks &amp; rating, will definitely update the game with the improvements &amp; fix the issues you report.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60f/60fa7edb5567c3d2c0785863c8d5915d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SUDHAKAR KANAKARAJ"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["SUDHAKAR KANAKARAJ"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
