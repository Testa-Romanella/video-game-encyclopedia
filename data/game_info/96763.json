This game is stylized after N64-era graphics and games such as <em>Vectorman</em> and <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em>. It's purpose is to tell a story about crossing boundaries, self-discovery and change. Mostly though it's just about swimming around and collecting yellow triangles.</p><p>Made for #jamforleelah</p><p>Big thanks to @killscreen and @CPriestman for the sweet review!
