So I decided to try to finish it regardless. The theme of the jam was \"Death is not the End\", so my game is an investigation minigame where you sacrifice subjects \u00a0to get more info from them. The less subjects you sacrifice the better.<br/><br/><strong>Rules of the game</strong> (They are inside the game as well):</p><p>The objective of the game is to find out who is the Assassin among the monsters and what weapon he used.</p>\n<p>Each monster has a set of Weapons and favorite Places.</p>\n<p>You can click monsters to ask them about their Basic info. (Weapons and Places).</p>\n<p>The Assassin will always kill using one of his weapons and the place must be one of either the Assassin's or the victim's favorite places.</p>\n<p>If the Assassin has more than one weapon at his disposal he will use the same one until the end.</p>\n<p>Each night the Assassin will kill a monster (for the night sacrifice).</p>\n<p>You can choose the sacrifice for each night but if you don't then it'll be chosen at random.</p>\n<p>Monsters killed don't reveal their basic info but can answer questions about the murder Weapon or Place or about the Assasin itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:16:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a8/6a805f3ef7b183c81a2a5c802dbcd953.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fahrenheit"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
