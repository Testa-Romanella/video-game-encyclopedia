The two genres I mixed were Rhythm and Endless runner. I am not a musician so I picked songs that I thought would be fun to play rather then just using music I made, because I tried and it wasn't very good. I originally started with the idea that I would make a rhythm racing game, but the idea quickly got scrapped because it was too hard to focus on driving and keeping the beat at the same time. For this game jam as well I imposed the restriction on myself that whatever I made had to be in 3D, as a way to test my self and learn more, as many of my previous games had been in 2D.\u00a0Post your best scores in the comments and check out my other games!</p>\n<p>The audio visualizer doesn't work in browser, for the full experience please download the game!</p>\n<p>Github repo<br/></p>\n<p>Song Credits:</p>\n<p>She Did It - Rush Garcia</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0s3dMwdJlM&amp;ab_channel=RushGarcia<br/></p>\n<p>Megalovania - Toby Fox</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTnKoi3-fi1Vcl7R3a4hvuA<br/></p>\n<p>Changing - FELT</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/Gr2A6J5tYZk<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T06:12:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/924cd74b78383a1c4b516b9ab49cb3fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RyanVentus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
