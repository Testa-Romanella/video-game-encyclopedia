I do not know why this does not work as it seems to work in the engine. One fix right now is to task manager and quit the game there.\u00a0 Sorry for this, I will try to find a actual fix.</p>\n<p>Update: The bug is fixed now.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------Warning:-------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game contains flashing lights, if you suffer from epilepsy or any other harmful reactions when viewing flickering lights you should not play this game. Also this is a horror game, so if you are weak of heart please continue with discretion.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------Description:-------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>You are an employee working in a building which just experienced a power outage; the boss asked you to go down to the basement and turn on the power generator. As you venture down into the basement you find yourself in an unfamiliar place of the building. Is this eerie location really a part of the building that you have never seen before or is it something else entirely?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Greetings and Welcome :D. The Halls is a very short horror experience made by me.\u00a0 This is my very first attempt at making a horror game, therefore I am looking for as much critique as possible. It is made as a way for me to test the waters and learn the mechanics in the horror genre so to speak.\u00a0All criticisms will be much appreciated. This short game took me longer than it should have to make, I started last summer but given my studies I had to take huge breaks in between development sessions. Overall, it did not meet my expectations but I\u00a0decided to finish it anyway and hope that it can provide you with at least a small amount of entertainment ;)</p>\n<p>Notice: All assets used in this game are free from the unity asset store, they were used to model the map because I am a CS student who does not have a lot of money T_T. The scripts and gameplay mechanics, however, are made from scratch by me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>------------------------------Credits:-------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>All sound effects are from freesounds.org.</p>\n<p>Sounds are taken from Jagadamba: https://freesound.org/people/Jagadamba/sounds/256008/, InspectorJ: https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/415873/, and TheDweebMan: https://freesound.org/people/TheDweebMan/sounds/277192/.
