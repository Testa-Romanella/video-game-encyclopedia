You are going to visit your friend, and the path is long and it will take many days. As you plan and trace your route on a cloth map(or paper), using needle and thread(or pen), you will use and answer story prompt cards to discover the stories and primary incidents behind your friendship, find strange and wonderful objects and people on your path, and build your own narrative of this particular journey and friendship.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p><strong>A Mending is a</strong>\u00a0<em>keepsake game</em><strong>, a term that I use to describe the kind of game I make - games that produce beautiful, memorable physical artifacts through the gameplay</strong>\u00a0<strong>process.\u00a0</strong>These keepsakes are a collaboration between me, as a designer, and the players, who all create their own unique objects. This honors my lifetime love of tinkering and making, and reduces waste by producing something worth keeping.\u00a0Jeeyon Shim\u00a0and I began using this term while making our keepsake game, Field Guide to Memory, to describe the work we do.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>For more information, you can visit the game's Kickstarter page.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This download includes the printable files to make your own version of A Mending, and the instruction booklet as a .pdf.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please note that this is not a ready-to-play game from the moment you download the files.\u00a0Because of this game's card and map elements, it is recommended that you print and prepare a <em>physical</em> copy of this game. Several people have made their own versions of the game - I think you'll have fun making a physical copy of the game!</p>\n<p>This document\u00a0has printing recommendations; I recommend reviewing it so you know your game prep options!</p>\n<p><strong>This is what is included in the download:</strong></p>\n<ol><li><strong>CARD FILES\u00a0</strong><ol><li>48 cards, as individual .jpg files, as well as the card back designs.</li></ol></li><li><strong>MAP FILES</strong><ol><li>The cloth map, in color and B&amp;W .jpg files.
