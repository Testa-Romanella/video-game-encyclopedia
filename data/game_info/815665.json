Anything. Even though this is an extremely short game (only 3 levels), I wanted to see if i could figure out Pulp and Pulp Script. It is very basic, since i don't know what i'm doing yet. Ha.\u00a0 I did plenty of things wrong with this, but it was a learning experience. Hopefully, I\u00a0can make a second game that is a true game.</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T07:35:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ce/8ce6f7439edfff05815c8f130e1b5d1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gogamego"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
