{"id": 391962, "slug": "monsters-on-my-mind", "name": "Monsters on My Mind", "name_original": "Monsters on My Mind", "description": "<p>This game was developed during the \"PLAY19 - Of Monsters and Games - UE\u00a0Game Jam\" at the University of Applied Sciences\u00a0Europe - Campus Hamburg. Over the course of two days, the three developers teamed up to bring the initial vision, of dealing with ones inner monsters through the process of\u00a0meditation, to fruition.<br/>This game purposefully juxtaposes the spiritual and heavier topic at hand with a cartoony art style, to frame a potentially serious matter in a rather light-hearted and jovial manner.</p>\r\nGame Description\r\nSynopsis\r\n<p>\"Monsters on My Mind\" allows the player a simplified glimpse into an exemplary meditation process.<br/>The player, in the form of a female teenager, plays through two stages of a mindfulness meditation. The first stage of the game deals with the processing of thoughts that occupy and sometimes tend to\u00a0cloud the mind. The second stage will draw forth the inner monster, which will then have to be identified and dealt with accordingly to allow the player (character) to move on.<br/></p>\r\nKey Features\r\n<ul><li>Modern Meditation Methods - Take a glimpse at how meditation can be utilised in the modern world, void of temples and incense.</li><li>Serious Games Can Be Fun - Experience a fun game with a serious\u00a0topic.</li><li>Cartoon Fans Welcome - If you enjoy cartoon art, this is the game for you.</li><li>Quick Inspirational Spark - Keen to expand your game experience horizon?
