It was a lot of fun and it was a good\u00a0opportunity to try out what I learnt over\u00a0the last nine months about programming and\u00a0game design at\u00a0The Indie Quest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea082ee1089952d0d31c202a7a2a82e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rymdlingen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
