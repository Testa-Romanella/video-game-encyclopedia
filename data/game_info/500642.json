Partly it depends only on You because the game has several options to make a choice, plus you can enjoy the original bonus chapter to dive in the spirit of this epoche. And the excellent graphics and atmospheric soundtracks will plunge you into the gaming atmosphere like into the movie. It was an actual human story. <br/><br/>Deja Vu is a hidden object adventure game, but the game doesn't follow the same formula usually used for Hidden Object Adventure games:  take the same game format and copy &amp; paste it from one game to the next, change the graphics and the plot, but the Hidden Objects scenes &amp; Mini-Games are in the same places and in the same order in every game. You are following the same familiar paths and doing the same familiar steps to get from point A to B because it IS the same formula. But this game won\u2019t give you DEJA VU about such formula anymore, this is a REAL adventure! Exceptional graphics, color, sound, excellent music.
