Passive aggressively change the radio station by pressing E! Once you're done chopping up the carrot, walk over the the oven and press space to win.</p><p>This is a game about making lasagne with your dad and fighting about what music to listen to. I really do enjoy cooking with my dad, and it usually isn't that passive-aggressive, but just making a game about happily chopping up carrots would be kinda boring, I thought. This isn't really anything at all like I wanted it to be, because coding is god damn impossible. I'm gonna keep working on it until I feel like I could show it to my dad without him vomiting all over my computer.</p>\n<p>I really like 3D modeling, so that part was fun. Of course, I couldn't actually get most of the nice models I made to show up the way I wanted them to in unity, so I guess all those hours were pretty much pointless. Otherwise, I couldn't really find anything I enjoyed doing about the project, and it mostly just made me wanna die even more than before. Anyway, at least I've realized that game design probably isn't for me? So I might just give up. Or exclusively make games about being cripplingly depressed. One of those.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bb/8bbf65dee2f456785b13b341ef5dc8ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cat_efalls"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
