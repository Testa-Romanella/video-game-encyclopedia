{"id": 498664, "slug": "blinkspace", "name": "BlinkSpace", "name_original": "BlinkSpace", "description": "<p>BlinkSpace is a minimalist bullet hell survival game where you must cut enemy ships apart with your ship to survive. Attacking too much without killing an enemy will cause you to lose. Attacking the wrong part of an enemy will cause you to lose. Crashing into an enemy projectile will cause you to lose. Try for the highest score or highest kill count. Your runs with the highest score or kill count will be saved. Killing multiple enemies in \u00a0a row without missing will cause a combo multiplier to increment. Missing an enemy will cause the combo multiplier to reset to 1.<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>Tapping the screen will cause your ship to move to that position. Moving into a red or blue object will cause your ship to explode. Moving through a green bar that is attached to an enemy will cause the enemy to die. If you kill an enemy your energy will be restored. Every move that does not kill an enemy will deplete your energy level by 1. Having 0 energy left will cause you to lose. Energy remaining is indicated by the green circles in the top left of the screen. Passively passing through a green energy bar of an enemy will not cause any effect, only active attacks can kill enemies.<br/><br/>How To Avoid Dying<br/>Only the very center of the green circle (your ships energy source) is relevant for calculating if you will die or not, other parts of your ship can overlap with enemies and projectiles without losing. If the center of that green circle on your ship falls within a red or blue circle you lose. If you cross a red or blue line or circle while attacking you lose. Holding still can sometimes be a good strategy but not for long.<br/><br/>Can you get to 100 kills? 200?<br/><br/>Note From The Publisher<br/><br/>Hello! I am excited to see that you are on my itch.io page! I am a solo developer and this is my first published video game. Currently this game is in development with more enemies and effects planned but I hope that you will take the time to play it and possibly support the project. I believe it is already quite addicting and I would love to hear feedback.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T04:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8be/8bef14b01435ad31f6d45f710fb47005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["not_the_fox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
