It's not so simple when you take into account that you're playing as a neon bar spinning around at high speeds.</p>\n<p>The game has three separate difficulties to play on, and each one is twice as hard as the last.</p>\n<p>Basic Instructions: Red is bad, blue and yellow are good. Press space or A on your controller (X on playstation controllers) to reverse the direction of your spin.<br/></p>\n<p>It's recommended that you play with a controller, but keyboard works too. Also, because of some weird stuff with the engine, you need to use a mouse for the main menu.</p>\n<p>It may also be important to note that the game slows down if your framerate is below 60 fps. If it seems to be running in slow-motion, turn the graphics down.</p>\n<p>Also, it doesn't keep track of scores for you. You'll need to do it with a pencil and notepad like yon caveman ancestors of the arcade age. Or wait... didn't arcade machines have a scoreboard? Eh.</p>\r\nWIP Update:\r\n<p><strong>The new update I'm working on will improve the game in a few notable ways, including:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Framerate independent gameplay, so regardless of how good your computer is you can still play.</strong></li><li><strong>Mac and Linux versions (if possible)</strong></li><li><strong>Additional play modes for more fun</strong></li><li><strong>Functioning high score, possibly with a leaderboard to compete against your friends</strong></li><li><strong>Graphical update</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys/Left Joystick : Move</p>\n<p>Space/Bottom Face Button : Change rotation direction</p>\n<p>Backspace/Back : Exit to menu</p>\n<p>Escape/Pause/Start : Pause Game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d92fcb35bd08f93465cc01c2f7c4ce45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skeletonbane"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
