Try to imagine a game simple in its basics, but demanding from the very first level, where everything might kill you. Even the camera and the main protagonist are against you as both of them constantly move forward. Add some barbed wire, spikes, and sawblades and you'll get Red Game Without a Great Name. And in this game <strong>you will die a lot.</strong><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>You control a mechanical bird that serves as a messenger in a hostile, steampunk world. To get the letter from one cage to another you have to maneuver the bird between all the obstacles. However, you don\u2019t directly control the main hero. The bird moves at its own pace, as does the camera. The trick is you can only order the bird to teleport from one point to another by clicking on it and draging to mark its destination. <br/><br/>Don\u2019t worry about frustrations though (not too much at least), you won\u2019t notice loading screens between the restarts, and the swinging music, as well as the one-more-try syndrome will keep you playing until you complete all of the 60 cleverly designed levels. There are three different power-ups to help you out in your mailman duties, but beware, they may work as double-edged swords if used without caution.<br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><ul><li> Simple to grasp, hard to master game mechanic \u2013 click &amp; drag to teleport<br/></li><li> 60 difficult levels<br/></li><li> 180 gears to collect<br/></li><li> 3 power-ups to enhance your abilities.<br/></li><li> Unique art style dominated by red <br/></li><li> One more attempt syndrome<br/></li><li> Swinging music</li></ul>", "metacritic": 55, "released": "2015-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a19/a19d52ae48a271fa56c7d1c86ae86ad0.jpeg", "website": "http://ifun4all.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 102, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["iFun4all"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["iFun4all"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
