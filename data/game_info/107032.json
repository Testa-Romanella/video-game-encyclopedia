See bottom for changes.  Earlier betas are now deleted from this site to preserve space.  </p><p>Welcome to The Outsider.  An adaptation of the short story by HP Lovecraft, author and father of the modern horror genre.  In this game you are the outsider - bought up in a dark and dank castle forever cast into a gloom and fog who yearns to find a way to climb out of the fog and cloud to the sunlit sky above.<br/></p><p>Explore dark sunless caves, open secret passageways and solve puzzles to make your way through the sprawling castle and caves.  Will you make it to the dark tower and ascend to the light?  Will you discover the secret of the darkness, will you discover your purpose or will you go insane?</p><p>Released as a 12 chapter game, the outsider will release in parts as each one becomes ready.  Chapters one and two will be free however purchasers of the game will get all twelve parts to download as they are ready as well as additional material including behind the scenes \"how do they do that\" videos, concept sketches and more.  </p><p>This is a true horror game, you are unarmed and alone.  How will you escape to the light?  You cannot fight that which you cannot see, you cannot escape that which you cannot hear.  Follow the clues, avoid the lurking fear and find your destiny.  </p><p>This is an early access game.  Please be aware that there may be minor bugs which I will be patching constantly during the lifecycle of the game.</p><p>Once you have played the early access free beta, please take a moment to go to www.facebook.com/theoutsidergame and like it and then fill in the survey linked on the page so that I can correct errors.  </p><p>System requirements.</p><p>CPU: 2 GHz Dual Core Processor</p><p>CPU Speed: Info</p><p>RAM: 2 GB</p><p>OS: Windows XP SP3</p><p>Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 8800/ATI Radeon HD 2600 (256MB minimum)</p><p>Sound Card: Yes</p><p>Free Disk Space: 10 GB</p><p>Although it will run probably fairly horribly.
