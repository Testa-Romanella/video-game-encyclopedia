{"id": 672408, "slug": "balls-mania", "name": "Balls Mania!", "name_original": "Balls Mania!", "description": "\"Balls Mania!\" presents a truly unique and creative fun filled game that is 100% mouse controlled!  You'll need quick reflexes and lots of practice to conquer this game and establish your high score as the king of this game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse your mouse to maneuver your ball to catch the blue balls on the screen while avoiding contact with all of the red balls bouncing around the screen.  As you progress, the action will speed up and make things much more challenging.  You'll be able to snag ball goop and place it with your left mouse button in the path of fast moving enemy balls to slow them down and try and gain some control back.  Capturing a sword will allow you to slice enemy balls in half by just moving your ball near them.  Shields can also help protect you from death, but be careful because in this game, you only get one life!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T03:18:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/289/2891fafe2d4531f74cde40dcc7f94c10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZaxtorGameS"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ZaxtorGameS"], "esrb_rating": null}
