Attacking the enemy or healing yourself is up to you. See how many enemies you can defeat. The enemy class is random so you'll either get the same enemy again or a different enemy class\u00a0 to fight. Remember to turn CAPS LOCK on when the fight begins as this is your only hope of getting through the catacombs.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T08:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/639/6394e49c4c2de95453c2c1aacc5c90a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mblenkhorn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
