This is my first ever 'complete' game, and I'm proud to have done it in just over 48 hours. This was a challenge, and I found that just getting rolling was one of the hardest parts. I actually started developing two different games through the 48 hours, and what they had in common was utilizing gravity and joint/rope physics. I'm very happy with the result, and hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/470/470fecd12b62dfa4d1169ccb87dc1858.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Quoclon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
