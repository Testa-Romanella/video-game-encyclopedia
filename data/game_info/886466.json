A land filled with knights, monsters, sorcerers and dragons. A land of promise! A land of possibilities. A wild and majestic world, just waiting to be conquered!! But not by you. You will not train and become strong. You will not fight any dragon. No princess will be saved by your bravery. You, my friend, will serve ale. <br/><br/>In this game you take the role of an NPC, and more specifically, a bartender. Your job is simple, give beer to players when they walk in. The fun of the game is seeing all the weird, odd and wonderful characters generated by the game. There are over a hundred different assets, and a nearly infinite amount of different combinations of these. They also have voice lines and names that are unique to their character, making each of them feel like real characters, with stories behind them. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T05:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9d/d9dd5ec0c75edf676c8644443d85d9e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nakras"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
