WHY!? I hear you ask, because you get points.</p><p>The game will randomly sample a colour from the image and select a random target area. All you have to do is zoom in on parts of the image until the pixels in the target area match the target colour. The closer they match, the more points you'll win.</p><p>First ever game. Written for just for Qazijam 9.5. It has a few kinks to work out and is just a prototype but I think it's okay for my first.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2d70081b66c479f496d0fea5030ef2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Eumenedies"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
