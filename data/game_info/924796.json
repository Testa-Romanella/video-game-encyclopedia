The more roots you have, the more resources you consume, so you must harvest more, and the cycle repeats!\u00a0</p>\n<p>But remember, all that matters in the end, is that the root must GROW.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made as my submission for the Global Game Jam 2023 on the theme \"<strong>Roots</strong>\". It was entirely made in 48 hours, and I created all the code (in Python) and visual assets.
