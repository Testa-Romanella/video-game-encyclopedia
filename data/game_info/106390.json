These crazed warriors will charge forward recklessly as players can turn left and right but are unable to stop or slow down.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTo achieve victory players must collect flaming spheres to gain speed. Use said speed to eliminate slower foes through collision while avoiding faster enemies for obvious reasons. Also avoid stationary objects and foes of equal speed as they will leave you stunned and reset your speed. Lastly keep in mind that high-speed collisions with anything other than slower opponents will result in your imminent blood-spattered death.
