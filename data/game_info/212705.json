Well how about your ball falls into a new board and you just keep going! We needed to add a new ending mechanic so we added lights that need to be activated on each board. When all the lights are lit the next board you drop into will be the victory board.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Attribution:</strong></p>\n<p>Developed with Unity 2018<br/></p>\n<p>All music and sounds are from FreeSound.org and are listed below. <br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/summonhue/sounds/21685/<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/hihirex/sounds/66876/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Brokenphono/sounds/344152/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/VSokorelos/sounds/346183/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/jameswrowles/sounds/380639/<br/></p>\n<p>All other assets and scripts were made by us for this project.</p>\n\n<p>\"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.
