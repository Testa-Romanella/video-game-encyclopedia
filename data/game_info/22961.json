{"id": 22961, "slug": "hitman-3-contracts", "name": "Hitman: Contracts", "name_original": "Hitman: Contracts", "description": "<p>Hitman 3: Contracts is an assassin simulator game developed by IO Interactive. It is a third installment in the Hitman series.</p>\n<p>Bleeding out Agent 47 tumbles into one of the rooms in an unknown Paris hotel. He passes out and starts hallucinating about his previous contracts. Each of these memories is a single mission that has to be completed by the player.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the previous game, the detection can be avoided much more easily. The enemies barely notice the Hitman dressed in someone else&#39;s clothing. They can still notice you if you stand in front of a guard for too long or openly carry a knife. Players have a lot of options for killing their target. Environmental kills are now much more common. For example, in one of the missions, the player has to eliminate a target using a pillow. </p>\n<p>The game now features a much more gritty tone. It usually takes place in foggy, rainy or snowy environments. There are many locations in a game ranging from a gothic manor to a meat processing plant where a BDSM party is held. 7 of the game&#39;s 12 levels are remakes of Hitman: Codename 47.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2004-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T21:00:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/07b/07b5abbe6330a76d6b30636d3aa5e0f3.jpg", "website": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-contracts/", "rating": 3.93, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 170, "owned": 2166, "beaten": 480, "toplay": 53, "dropped": 106, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 473, "suggestions_count": 434, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 475, "platforms": ["macOS", "Xbox", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Square Enix", "IO Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
