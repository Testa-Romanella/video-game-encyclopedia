But be warned; allowing the power to run out may be very bad for you.</p>\n\n\r\nMade in under 72 hours for Ludum Dare 39  (Running out of Power)\r\n\r\n<p>Was pretty disappointed in this Ludum Dare game, ah well. :\\</p>\n<p>Down is to interact btw, I forgot to put that in the tutorial bit.<br/><br/>To avoid some tedium when the power runs out, pressing R will respawn you back at the start, though this will, however not bring the person with you. Also, I advise heavy usage of the tram system.</p>\n\n<p>You do not lose any progress when you die, you only drop any person you're carrying, should've explained that in the game somewhere.<br/><br/></p>\n\r\nBy: \r\nRobin Field - Programming/Art\r\nBilly Hobson - Music/SFX", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04d/04d3b42e6c2b59a2c8096287a4a7ac2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robin Field", "Juicy Brucey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
