Driven by natural selection</p>\n<p>The creature you witness at the beginning is\u00a0<strong>randomly generated</strong>. But it only wants two things:<strong> <em>eat and reproduce</em></strong>. Every creature has it`s very own <strong><em>genome</em></strong>. They all differ from speed, max size, the range of their vision and so on. When they eat enough, they split and <strong><em>create a child</em></strong>. In most cases it will be a identical clone of the partent but there is a small chance, that a <strong><em>mutation</em> </strong>happens. Will the child be more successful as the last generation? And what about the other islands of food far from the parents colony. Might it present a possible new habitat? What will evolve? And which creatures will become extinct?\u00a0Let`s find out...</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Info about creature - Left click on creature</p>\n<p>Info about\u00a0random creature - Right click OR click on INFO</p>\n<p>Different simulation speed - Left click on gamespeed OR press 0-8</p>\n\n<p>INFOs:</p>\n<ul><li>Evolving higher speed, vision or similar skills\u00a0will requiere more energy and the creature has to eat more to stay alive\r\n</li><li>A mutation is displayed in the name of the creature.
