Finally, you can get out of work and head home... it\u2019s winter again, and the days are shorter - It\u2019s pitch-black already.<br/>Maybe at the end of the year, you\u2019ve saved enough money for a car but for now, public transports will do.<br/>You\u2019ve read about issues in this city, but certainly not in your neighborhood! Everyone seems very nice so it certainly shouldn\u2019t be a problem; you will do just fine!\r\n\n<p>In\u00a0<em>Commute,\u00a0</em>you will play as Sam, a young worker in a big city. It is your responsibility to get them home safe while navigating through the streets at night\u00a0and beware of\u00a0their inhabitants. \u00a0During the game, the player will face harassment and possibly dangerous situations, as many people do daily.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game was made as a masters'\u00a0final project for the Fine Arts Faculty of Lisbon. The thesis\u00a0discusses women's paths in gaming environments, be it as gamers, students or professionals. In relation to this, the effects of feminism are considered and serve as a foundation to most of the game's structure.\r\n</p>\n<p>This being a prototype has missing features, and possibly bugs - thanks for understanding. After finishing my master's, I\u00a0will keep working on\u00a0the game and have it finished!</p>\n<p>Sofia Santos - Concept, Art, Music, Programming;</p>\n<p>Francisco Barros - Lead Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T03:23:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2e9fa4c0f853550762257ab8896e284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Francisco Barros", "Sofia Santos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
