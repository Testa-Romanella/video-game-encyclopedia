Still, be careful. Some say that your left arm is strong with the help of your grapple, and your right one is for his little rocket launcher.<br/>Please remain safe.<br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>Controls: ZQSD for basic movement<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spacebar to jump<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Left-click uses your grapple<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Right-click uses your rocket launcher.<br/>In this game, you have to flee from a black hole on the planet you are sent to and get back to your ship alive.<br/><br/>The team :<br/>Game Design: Cl\u00e9ment Navarro, Simon Dialinas<br/>Game Art: Mathis Calmettes-Sombris<br/>Game Prog: Th\u00e9o Driutti, Lucas Guichard, L\u00e9o Nimsgern<br/><br/>Music: Kai Engel - Meekness<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - YouFulca<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T06:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e9/3e91f56ef907705eb9e5daff720c9a9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheoDriutti", "L\u00e9o Nimsgern", "Taki_cn", "DisturbedBanana", "SDLNS", "Mat_99"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
