Therefore I have based the game around this memory from when I was young.</p>\n<p>You play as 80's kid who is having a nightmare, he finds himself outside his house and has lost all his pocket money, you must guide him through a procedurally generated level made up of various rooms themed on old arcade games to find his lost pocket money. Once all pocket money has been found you can then find the final screen and enter the arcade to spend the hard earned money.</p>\n<p>There are 2 difficulty levels easy mode has you collecting 3 coins, hard mode has you collecting 5 coins across a larger number of screens. There is also the option to turn on infinite lives like cheats from the old days.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Left - Left arrow</p>\n<p>Right - Right arrow</p>\n<p>Up - Up arrow</p>\n<p>Down - Down arrow</p>\n<p>Jump - Space Bar</p>\n<p>Player can also be controlled using a game pad</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:22:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b97/b972381bc00c78c33b6c34a98621eb70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Frozen Well Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
