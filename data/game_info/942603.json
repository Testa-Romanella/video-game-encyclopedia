My goal in this challenge is to remake 20 classic games that I remember from my childhood with my own touch. I have ranked 20 classic games according to their difficulty (in my opinion). First there was Pong Game.\u00a0Thus the Pong-like Game was born (I know, very original name)</p>\n<p>The Pong game was originally developed by Allan Alcorn and released in 1972 by Atari corporations. Soon, Pong became a huge success, and became the first commercially successful game, on 1975.</p>\n\n<p>Pong-like Game is a simple fun game that can be played with one or two players. The aim is to send the ball to the opponent's court and score a goal. As the game is played, the accumulated global points pass to the player who scored the goal, and the game continues until all lives are exhausted. Starting with 5 shared lives, the points will become more valuable as the game progresses.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Single\u00a0Player</p>\n<p>W or Up Arrow Key - &gt; Move Up</p>\n<p>S or Down Arrow Key -&gt; Move Down</p>\n<p>Two Player</p>\n<p>Left Player moves with W-S Keys</p>\n<p>Right Player moves with Up-Down Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>M -&gt; Mute the music</p>\n<p>N -&gt; Mute sound effects</p>\n<p>Tab or Q -&gt; Go back to Main Menu</p>\n<p>R -&gt; Restart the game</p>\n<p>P or Pause -&gt; Pause the Game</p>\n<p>In The Menu</p>\n<p>up-down-left-right or WSAD keys to navigate</p>\n<p>E or Space key to choose</p>\n<p>Q or Tab key to go back/cancel</p>\n<p>Note: In game info text says Press Escape to go to the Main Menu.
