The longer you survive, the harder it gets, bigger, and also, faster asteroids will appear. It is a spinoff of a legendary arcade Asteroids, but you can't shoot, so use your skills and evasive maneuvers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:39:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93b9e8fb43307bd581f56a3915bb7e20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tof"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
