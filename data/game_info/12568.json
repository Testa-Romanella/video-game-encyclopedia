Help him and his crew fix their ship before spaceworms attack!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHALP! is a single-player VR sandbox puzzle game where you help a stranded robot captain and his crew fix their broken ship... or where you DON'T do that and instead poke around and mess with the ship's various gizmos and contraptions. Put out fires! Fight giant carnivorous worms! Shoot some hoops! Make a general mess of things! There's plenty to do in HALP!'s colorful and light-hearted world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHALP! is best played with tracked motion controllers such as HTC Vive, or Oculus Touch OR with an HMD and gamepad, but we recommend using tracked motion controllers for the ideal VR experience!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:10:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a8/2a87d4817eaa6704d1fbf9051bb24f5f.jpg", "website": "http://www.FunBits.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 165, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 570, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fun Bits"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fun Bits"], "esrb_rating": null}
