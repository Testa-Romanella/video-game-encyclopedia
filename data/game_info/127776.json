Soon after arriving she became an employee for a beautiful multi based market. Her life was finally looking up, until one night at work that change everything!<br/></p>\n<p>This being a prototype is very short with the game time being at max 15 minutes. It gives a small taste of whats to come. The final release will have custom graphics, artwork, music, and a detailed story-line to follow through out the series! Yes you heard that right, this game won't be one! So as you play, gauge the feeling I\u00a0am trying to convey with the placeholder graphics.<br/><br/>I\u00a0like to thank the team over at RMMV for the One Map Challenge that inspired this project.
