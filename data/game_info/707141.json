Our primary goals were\u00a0to prototype the different controllers (First person zombie, hand, and eye) with the systems that would be used with them and to prototype the environment aesthetic. Specifically we wanted the hand climbing walls to feel great and similar to the hand from the Adam's family, the zombie to feel slow, and the eye to feel limited and constrained since it is only 1 eye. The environment we wanted to feel dark and drab like an old abandoned house to add an element of horror to its narrative.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T19:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf8b305f65030370a516e7b797c6a1c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Jacob Welch - Game Designer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
