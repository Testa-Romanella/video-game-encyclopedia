{"id": 918722, "slug": "downright-fierce", "name": "DownRight Fierce", "name_original": "DownRight Fierce", "description": "A visual novel about fighting game gals finding themselves, losing themselves, and finding themselves again.<p><em>The current version of this project <strong>contains some harsh language</strong>, but that's about it in terms of warnings for now. The planned story will include more mature scenes, descriptions of violence,\u00a0and darker themes that would probably put it in an 'Rated M' kind of territory.</em><br/></p>\n<p>The slice-of-life shenanigans of visual novels like <em>Butterfly Soup </em>and <em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em> meet the quirky, power-infused worlds of fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Rival Schools</em> in this character driven visual novel. Designed to feel like the fully fleshed out backstory of a small fighting game roster, <em>DownRight Fierce</em> will have players riding shotgun with protagonist <strong>Nishiko Shimomura </strong>as they are shipped off to a private school after acting out one too many times by abusing their latent Street Fighter -esque powers. Nishiko will have to navigate relationships in Windy Pines Academy, a strict boarding school designed to train those who are able to wield Ki-Flow, the ability to manifest one's own soul and spirit energy into physical form.</p>\n\n<p>Make choices that will influence Nishiko's personal growth, from physical attributes to friendships and, if you're lucky, perhaps some sweethearting on the side. The choices you make will alter Nishiko's abilities, affecting how they perform later on in fighting scenes, as well as unlocking or locking dialogue options at various points. Think of this like a <em>TellTale/Life is Strange</em> styled game with a primary narrative but branching side scenes and various alternate moments -- much less flashy presentation but a lot more variables and variation in things that can happen during scenes.</p>\n\n<p>I personally do not think a character's identity or sexuality should inherently be considered a 'spoiler,' but I can respect wanting to discover these characters' identities yourself in-universe. So for now, what I will make clear is <strong>that this is a queer, LGBT+ story,</strong> featuring characters of various ethnicities and identities.</p>\n<p>I created this story concept and its main characters\u00a0in 2014, and the release of <em>Butterfly Soup</em> inspired me to start adapting it and rebooting it as a visual novel. I've been working on it sporadically since January 2020, and this is the first public release of my progress so far. As of this build (January 31, 2023) I've managed to edit the Prologue through to much of Chapter 2. I'll leave what I have past that present in this build, and intend to do a follow-up update in February or March to bring things up to the end of Chapter 3 before progressing further into the game's development using feedback I get from this public build.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing as <strong>this is a total work-in-progress</strong>, please excuse placeholder items, especially backgrounds and some sound effects. The sound balance probably needs a lot of fine-tuning as well, given the OST contains a lot of more intense music and the voicework so far is mostly brief barks, 'hm' and 'oh' and that kind of thing. I'm sharing my work so far in the hopes of getting feedback and support from those who may connect with this project.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to see behind-the-scenes progress on what I'm working on with this or any other project, and/or support my ability to commission assets for this game, please check out the Patreon.</p>\n<p>You can also donate a one-time thing at Ko-Fi.\u00a0All money received through Patreon and Ko-Fi goes directly into creating art/music/etc. for this game!

You can quit the game at any time from the side menu when pressing [Right Click.] The option is on the bottom of the list. If you're on the main menu, go to settings, and 'Quit' will be on the list on the left.</p>\n<p>While I've tried my best to weed out any bugs or errors, there may be odd instances of sprite parts popping out of existence, or spawning in incorrect locations.</p>\n<p>Sound has NOT been mixed much, so apologies for any potential imbalances. Feel free to let me know about any specific things that seem especially egregious.</p>\n<p>If you run into a situation where the entire game crashes, try reloading, rewinding, and picking a different option for now, but please feel free to let me know if you find any instance of this I've managed to miss. I have quick tested full run throughs just to make sure it's possible to clear through things but there could be choice-specific variables I've missed so far.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is not a Linux version due to the time it takes to build/upload, but if someone requests one, I'll build it and upload it for you, just ask!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T12:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a9/8a9d508d47b2f96666c584126897ca0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Destiny-Smasher"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
