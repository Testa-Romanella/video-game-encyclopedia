Creating a game that makes people feel smart seemed like a worthwhile goal, so he counted his savings, realized he wouldn't starve for a year, and jumped into making Terraforming Earth.\u00a0</p><p>His vision\u00a0and early prototypes\u00a0convinced his friends at\u00a0Noppa Design\u00a0to drop some actual customers and\u00a0take up the project's\u00a0art\u00a0direction. Csaba Kalman and Loci Alvegi filled Andras's dry and technical world with\u00a0beautiful landscapes\u00a0and\u00a0quirky characters.\u00a0</p><p>Untainted by industry expertise, we are here to surprise you with something new and memorable.<br/></p>Early Access: Summer 2019\r\n<p>The game is under heavy development, this\u00a0is is an Alpha Demo. There are already many more obstacles in the game than the demo shows you.\u00a0For the Early Access release in June we plan to add more puzzles, more mission types, more environments, and of course the story will unfold and you'll find out\u00a0where did all the humans go.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:32:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcd/fcd3bcce7ecb909c72564e3a10204a62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Andras Csibi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
