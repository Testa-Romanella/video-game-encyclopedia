I'm not an itch.io pro, so I'm not sure the best way to go about adding it here. I'm not able to uplaod it as a zip as the files require a web server to correctly serve the pages without the .html ending</p><p>Welcome to Scriptless Pipes!</p>\n<p>This game was made entirely using only HTML and CSS. Not a single drop of script is contained in this project or was used to make this!\r\n</p>\n<p>The goal of Scriptless Pipes is simply to get to the bottom of the webpage! You utilize the pipes to take you deeper and deep to the various layers of each level.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some levels have additional tasks like flipping levers, or finding/ solving a code before you may progress to the next level.\r\n</p><p>This game works on mobile, (It's HTML and CSS why wouldn't it), but I do recommend you use landscape mode to prevent things from getting bunched up and over top of each other.</p>\n<p>Have fun and enjoy my game!\r\n</p>\n<p>Why did I only use HTML and CSS?\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>I don\u2019t really consider my self a true \u201cGame Dev\u201d, but over the past year I\u2019ve been recreating games with \u201cunconventional game engines\u201d, such as Snake in Discord, Tetris in Minecraft, and Battle Ship on Twitter. I like the unique challenge these bring, so I thought I\u2019d try to continue with the challenge for this Ludum Dare! HTML and CSS were chosen simply because they are both pretty powerful, but you would never think to make a game using only them.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/42848bb84620ac007d27afe14a706bdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TurkeyDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
