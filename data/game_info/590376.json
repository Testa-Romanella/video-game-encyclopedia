{"id": 590376, "slug": "project-two", "name": "Project Two", "name_original": "Project Two", "description": "<p>This is certainly a unique one. <br/>Project Two is a first person puzzle game where the player has control over one of two bodies at a time. The player must swap between these bodies to access different parts of the level to progress. As I liked to say, \"You must work cooperatively by yourself\"\u00a0 However to swap between these bodies you must do something one might not consider at first. You must simply look at it. Not with the camera, but with your eyes. Yes, the\u00a0main means of interacting with the world is not the keyboard, but their eyes. Using an eye tracker (which is needed to play the game) the player can use their eye gaze to interact with the world. To pull levers, to pick up objects, to swap between bodies, and even some unique interactions I will not reveal here. The eye tracker makes players think in ways they have not before and adds a new layer to some puzzles that can not be captured without the use of an eye tracker.<br/>What is currently available was indecently developed over the course of 10 weeks as a senior project. I had not thought highly of it but after being extremely well received by my peers I figured I would continue developing the game and see it through to a final ending. Along that same vein I decided to\u00a0post my in progress work and get more opinions on it. Any and all opinions on my work would be greatly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:20:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d9/4d901b6ba356a15390ffc602ae36386d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AHouston"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
