{"id": 15853, "slug": "star-wars-starfighter-2", "name": "STAR WARS Starfighter", "name_original": "STAR WARS Starfighter", "description": "<p>This is a flight simulator in the most famous sci-fi universe created by George Lucas. The game was released on the original Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC. The plot of the game unfolds before the Battle of Naboo, and the events of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.</p>\n<p>The plot tells of the heroic deed of three heroes during the Invasion of Naboo: pilot Rhys Dallows,   Vana Sage, and Feeorin pirate Nym. Three storylines, which at first seem unrelated, along with the course of the development of the plot, combine into one story.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise Starfighter is an arcade spaceflight simulator. The player has to go through more than 14 story missions, which include raids on enemies position, escort cargo, and massive space battles. Critics also note the high quality of graphics for consoles of the sixth generation, and art-direction in general that only increases the movies effect, telling a related story. In the game, the only singleplayer mode is available to play, for multiplayer battles it is required to get a special edition of the game.</p>", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2001-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-23T18:54:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d1c5bbec6febd7fdfcb0c6f5a172110.jpg", "website": "http://www.lucasarts.com", "rating": 2.93, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 112, "owned": 1626, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 40, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 87, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 57, "reviews_count": 89, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "LucasArts Entertainment", "Lucasfilm", "Secret Level"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Disney Interactive", "LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
