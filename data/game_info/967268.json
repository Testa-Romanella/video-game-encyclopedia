You must use an array of Pea Pod Powers - including long vines and exploding peas \u2013 to defeat the alien scourge and save our world!<h3>Explore a wide world of fantastical islands</h3>Each island level is carefully (painstakingly) designed with a different theme and artwork, to complement the crops that live there! Watermelons live underwater, peppers live in a volcano, and who knows what else you\u2019ll find in the other levels! If you make it to a village, you might even get some helpful hints from the locals! <br/><h3>Power up your Pea Pod! </h3>Woah\u2026 like the name of the game! Your pea pod earns experience by defeating enemies, and gets stronger when it grows to a higher level! You can learn new attacks and upgrade its stats after finding enough minerals. Every new game gets randomized base statistics, so each pea pod is different!<h3>Defeat the alien fungi </h3>The aliens have really run amok! They conquered most of the island locals, teamed-up with giant insects, and even made grotesque hybrid bosses that now rule each island. To stop the fungi you\u2019ll need to defeat the insects and the boss of each level... and ultimately face-off against the lord of all fungi!<h3>Find collectables </h3>Every island is absolutely loaded with collectable items! Some items heal you, others give you minerals, and rare ones can even upgrade your pea pod! Sacred seeds are the most important items\u2026 the islanders hid them when the aliens invaded. After you defeat the boss, you\u2019ll need to find the sacred seeds hidden on each island!<br/><br/><br/>Can you power-up your pea pod, find the sacred seeds, <br/>and defeat the alien fungi once and for all? <br/><br/>We really hope so\u2026 these fungi are not fun guys!<h3>Features </h3><ul><li>12 Exciting attacks and abilities<br/></li><li>16 Large and diverse levels to explore<br/></li><li>14 Bizarre bosses to defeat<br/></li><li>Tons of enemies to fight and collectables to find!<br/></li><li>Upgradable player stats and player level system<br/></li><li>Custom music composed for each level<br/></li><li>Full support for keyboard or game controller<br/></li><li>Detailed UI, including menu, settings, full maps, and mini-maps<br/></li><li>All artwork and music were custom-made by the game developer for this unique digital experience! </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T02:30:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfc/bfc97baa6a4f2559e99e50891f921c03.jpg", "website": "https://www.aspergillusstudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aspergillus Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aspergillus Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
