The assignment brief gave me freedom in creating pretty much whatever I felt like as long as it\u00a0involved some form of 'interactive media'. I decided to create a handbook that incorporates various data visualisation techniques.</p>\n<p>This project was inspired by children's books/interactive websites with the idea being that it would be easy to understand and intuitive to play with while still incorporating the 'interactive' aspects.</p>\n<p>This project was created in Processing using Java. Any images used were found on Google Images and were free to use.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T08:35:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/757/757d96a6fda3b6aa9c17f35d8c320571.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garnet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
