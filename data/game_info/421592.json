Characters goal is to get back to the surface, collecting all the Starlight to propel themselves back to the stars. The player will experience no frustration through-out the puzzles allowing the user to focus directly on the gameplay experience. With layered backgrounds and environmental storytelling player is guided through appearances of different wildlife in various depths of the ocean, as the player completes puzzles and collects stardust they learn more about the creatures motivations and purpose of their existence. Each puzzle will also provide context to why the creature is on this planet and allow the player to fill in their own narrative.<br/></p>\n<p>Listening to relaxing instruments whilst playing can reduce the anxiety in the underwater world. The aim of the music is to relief stress to calm the player setting them into a deep thought mind-set. Using instruments such as, kalimba, synth and stylophone allows to create a distraction for the user to explore their emotions in the low beat sounds. With natural colours of de-saturated/muted greens, blues and browns the player will experience more homely and comfortable atmosphere as the user would come across those colours daily in their own home. Familiar colours and shapes will make the player feel confident and peaceful. Along with the music and the colours used we will also be using subliminal Induction of meditative state through respiratory mimicry of complementary audio-visual inputs, which consists of slow and soft breathing.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T04:26:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27b/27ba0fee9ee771fdbd78cbdf72cccf2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["itsVehx"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
