Is he even actually an adventurer? Who cares? Not the Crafting Goddess Joann, apparently! All she wants is a slave to make crap for her, and that slave appears to be this poor soul. I guess now that he's been chosen by a trans-dimensional entity to do some kind of bidding he doesn't really have a choice of sorts.\u00a0<br/><br/>At least there's some fun to be had as he traverses the dungeons generated from your old high-school reports and questionable images.\u00a0<br/><br/>Wait a second, did I just say old high-school reports?! They have value now?\u00a0<br/>You sure bet!\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>You'll have to delve deep into your hard drive's dungeons to create the list of items the goddess has bestowed upon you to create. All the dungeons are randomly generated from the files that you select on your hard drive, with bigger files creating bigger dungeons, and different file types designating different kinds of loot you can find. Items, craftables, and monsters all have generated names with randomly selected adjectives attached. Even the requirements to make the crafted items are random!\u00a0Use every menu and tool at your disposal to collect items and serve the goddess</p>\n<p>An alpha build from 2017 is also available for free, back from before the rebranding effort and when things were super simple.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Features</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\tRandomly generated dungeons based on your files </li>\n<li>Randomly generated items </li>\n<li>Randomly generated crafting recipes?</li>\n<li>A not really fresh take on the genre </li>\n<li>Being able to play with one hand with a beer in the other</li>\n<li>A not try-hard personality</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Buy the game on itch.io and get a key for the Steam release too!</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>\r\n\t* itch.io may not always have the latest builds of C:\\raft.
