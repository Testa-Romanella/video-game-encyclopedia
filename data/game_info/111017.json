So, thinking about the end of this year and what I learned, I decided that I wanted to do a reboot of the game in Bitsy. That way I didn't have to focus so much on the graphics and could focus more on text.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Using randomized text, there are tons of plants, interpretations of tarot cards in the major arcana, gemstones, and spells you can unearth on multiple playthroughs. It's not so much a story as much as it is just an interesting exploratory escape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just as in Activist Tea House, this game is an experience for people that need to take a break and be somewhere beautiful and have a cup of tea, or something else.\u00a0</p>\r\n\ud83c\udf38Thank you for coming and I hope you enjoy your time in SweetPea Village\ud83c\udf38", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/97776b389de51baa9270d028fcb4e6b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["magicalbitch"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
