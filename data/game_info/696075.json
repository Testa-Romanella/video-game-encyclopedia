The combustion of Gravitae in shipborne engines has enabled massive naval vessels to take to the skies, nimble as birds. New trade routes have been discovered unimpeded by land or ocean, bringing obscene wealth in a short period of time to a select few who control the extraction of this wondrous resource.<br/><br/>The rich and powerful have used Gravitae to levitate the most fertile lands and valuable assets out of the reach of ordinary people. They have built floating towns and cities saturated with comfort and luxury, unburdened by the destruction caused in the extraction of Gravitae.<br/><br/>Driving this massive change is a globe-spanning power unaccountable to any nation: the Dynamic India Company. It is rumored that the two DIC heads, only known as El Jeffe and Il Doge, are plotting to create an entire new world in the heavens for themselves to rule, by combining the stolen riches of the earth and the mass of the moon. Unstopped, this will spell certain and terminal disaster for everyone left on earth.<br/><br/>It is not too late yet.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T20:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fb/2fbba9ad623ca220ead25748a9a5ee65.jpg", "website": "https://www.piratesofgravitae.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Innerverse Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Innerverse Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
