I was kindly given the permission by Andr\u00e9 Cardoso (Mix and Jam) to use his Celeste Project to create this prototype. It's a collection of short segments that should teach the player the mechanics of the game. I tried using the isolation principle since its often perceived as \"the best\" way to teach players.\u00a0<br/></p><p>If you tried out my protoype, it would help me a lot if you would also fill out this survey about it! Don't worry, it's only five questions and you will remain anonymous. <br/>However I would like to use the data I gained from this survey for my Bachelors Thesis, so proceed on your own accord!<br/><br/></p><p><strong>SURVEYLINK</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please note: ONLY WINDOWS AND PS4 CONTROLLER SUPPORT!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T03:04:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/123/123edf75a9bb639bf2a6afc17671afe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandon Drewes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
