Well, with Ryan's Play BASEBALL, you can guess the next play and win points against your friends!<br/><br/>Game play is easy. All you have to do is select where you think the ball will go next. You can guess one of the nine positions on the field, or the walk / strikeout / hit by pitch option.<br/><br/>If you think the batter will get on base, you can select \"Hit.\"<br/>If you think a run will score or the batter will hit a home run, you can select \"Score Run\" or \"Home Run.\"<br/><br/>If you created the game then you are the default umpire, which means you are in charge of closing the guessing period before the first pitch is thrown to the batter, then entering the result of the play. The result of the play should include the first fielder to have control of the ball after it is hit, not the first fielder to touch the ball.<br/><br/>Umpires are also players in the games they create, so make sure that results entered are fair and accurate.<br/><br/>*Patent Pending* All Ryan's Play Sports Apps including RP Baseball are Patent Pending.<br/>Coming soon: RP Cricket, RP Basketball, RP Football, RP Soccer and more!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T05:01:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/921b188dd0e8abdb40a1617e575f6899_56BIMW1.jpg", "website": "http://www.ryansplay.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ryan's Play"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Ryans Play"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
