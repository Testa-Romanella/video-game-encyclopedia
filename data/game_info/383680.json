Brain freezeeeee :O<br/><br/>As notes come to you, slice them in the correct order and move to the beat! It's easy to play and fun to master! There are a total of 15 songs. From dubstep to rock, our range will grow and grow! Blocks can be sliced in four different directions; left'n right, up'n down! Now say it with me! LEFT'N RIGHT, UP'N DOWN, WE GONN' PARTY ALL NIGHT LONG! Some blocks don't have directions, so you can just tap, slice or hold your finger on them! Those sick guitar solos will feel awesome when you are playing them!<br/><br/>What are you waiting for!? No seriously, why? Just press that download button up there. Up. Look up. Yeah, that one. Now press it...<br/><br/>Did you press it?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T03:34:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af9/af9f8baa809f9bfb8c321d3b02775d6c_ecm0zsU.jpg", "website": "http://warlockarts.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Warlock Arts"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Warlock Arts Yazilim Sanayi ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
