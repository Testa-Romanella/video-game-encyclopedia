The game is  completely centered around Cooper's adventure into the black lodge.  There is multiple endings and a host of spirits to interact with.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>!!!MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!!!!!</strong>\u00a0\r\n    </p>\n<p>This game is made for fans of the show. You might want to avoid  playing if you haven't seen all of Twin Peaks and don't want it spoilt  for you. Plus it wouldn't make a heap of sense.\r\n    </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controls</strong> </p>\n<strong>Action</strong>\n<strong>Game Boy</strong>\n<strong>Keyboard</strong>\r\nMoveD-PadArrow Keys<br/>InteractAZBackBXInventorySelectShiftMenuStartEnter\r\n<p>The game was made in\u00a0<strong>GB Studio</strong>, an amazing piece of software by Chris Maltby. You can really download the ROM and run it on a real Game Boy, (I've tested it). \r\n    </p>\n<p>Twin Peaks: Meanwhile was made for my love of the show but also as a  way to learn game dev. This is my first actual game as well as my first  submission to any sort of game jam. I made everything by myself from  scratch. \u00a0 As noted in the game, I have more content mapped out but this  a shortened version to submit to the 2021 Game Boy Comp. \r\n    </p>\n<p>Big shout out to<strong> Robert Doman </strong>and<strong> Goodnight Girl</strong>. Their tutorials helped me immensely through this whole process. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:28:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a9e7dd975436b4593c1549fbb7da370.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tory Sciaccca"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
