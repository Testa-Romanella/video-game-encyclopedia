{"id": 2568, "slug": "virus-named-tom-a", "name": "A Virus Named TOM", "name_original": "A Virus Named TOM", "description": "<p>A Virus Named TOM is an indie puzzle strategy game developed by Misfits Attic.</p>\n<p>In a utopic world, a scientist gets fired by a giant corporation. He creates a virus and names it TOM. The only purpose of it is to get revenge. </p>\n<p>The game features 50 single-player levels in 6 different areas. With every completed level, the player disrupts one of the systems of the device that was infected with TOM. Each area represents one device which is used by humans in a utopian world. 50 more are available for cooperative play. The players objective is to connect all the nodes creating connection paths for them while avoiding the anti-virus drones present in the game. Sometimes, the player has to correctly turn the nodes in order to establish a connection. The enemies move in a repetitive pattern of traveling back and forth. While easily avoidable alone, the game gets harder and harder as the number of enemies increases.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2012-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-12T21:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35f/35f953424c1aada018490265f76e934d.jpg", "website": "http://www.avirusnamedtom.com/", "rating": 2.3, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 107, "owned": 1541, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 40}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 70, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 70, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 3", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Misfits Attic"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Arcade", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Misfits Attic"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
