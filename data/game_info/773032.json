Build 2.04 is our Pre-Alpha therefore it lacks many of the features of the Android /\u00a0PC Alpha Demo build.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Also, because the Avatar has been replaced with a flying camera many features of this build won't work if an avatar is required to interact with the feature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There lots of known issues with this build, however, enjoy seeing the foundation of the Gas City Metaverse from the sky.\u00a0 :-)<br/></p>\n<p>We know that this is probably all new to you but Gasflip puts our fans, customers, and supporters first, and for this release event, that means you get to look at this demo which is pre-release code. Consider this Flying Demo\u00a0a behind the scenes peek at the city from the air,\u00a0 and we're ok with showing you something we love despite the rough edges.
