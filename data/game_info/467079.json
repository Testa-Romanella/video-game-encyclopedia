The reason we believe this fits the \"Out of Control\" theme is because the only way to stop the animals from devouring your livelihood\u00a0is with your trusty herding dog, Shelby, that will stay within a certain distance of you, the farmer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is one twist though, if Shelby isn't pet frequently enough then she wanders farther and farther away leaving your crops stranded. Hopefully you can keep up\u00a0 with Shelby and still\u00a0make enough money selling crops to hold onto your farm before the bank takes your land, dog, and animals away.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce8/ce8c1cbbaab6869375b93cf285bd89e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WhiffKing"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
