It is the first of four total Nintendo DS titles.</h2>\n<p>Come step into the shop, we have so many seals for you to choose! Select and rent one of fourteen lively available seal pups, and take them under your wing to look after for the year. During your time together, you&#39;ll both come to find that you&#39;ve grown quite fond of each other&#39;s company. Receive a weekly fund from the &#39;Garden&#39; to aid with fostering your pup, as you feed them a variety of rice (some types are preferred over others), teach fantastic tricks via microphone, tank cleaning sessions, and organizing routines that your seal will adhere to- they&#39;ll remember what time supper is!</p>\n<p>Once the year is over, it&#39;s time to say goodbye and return your nurtured pup to the garden. But don&#39;t be too distraught; you&#39;ll be honored for your work, and you&#39;ll receive a chance to foster a new seal. Who knows? You may even come back to find your first seal has had pups of their own! Regularly visit the ever-growing town centre to explore its facilities, and utilize them to continue bonding with your pup.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-17T02:40:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1dfcc233654321158457452715328c0.jpg", "website": "http://www.san-x.jp/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Creative Core Co."], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
