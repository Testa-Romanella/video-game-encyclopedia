The additional notable change is the lack of the dynamically increasing game speed. This was cut for multiple reasons, but the biggest was just that it didn't feel very fun. Enemies would often jump you if you looked away for even a second, and this often causes chain reactions that just led to unavoidable deaths, making it more frustrating than expected.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:36:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39f/39f65c8dcc7a3b210b74667b43de4517.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cal Maher"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
