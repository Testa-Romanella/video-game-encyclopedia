I created a prototype for an incremental game in which the player is a god and trying to gain power through followers and prayers. The game features a moral pull between good and evil. While this project isn't the best I still like to look back at this project to see how far I've come in designing games.</p>\n<p>How To Play:</p>\n<p>Click the hands in the middle to gain prayers.</p>\n<p>Click on the upgrades to gain things like (More prayers per click with lightning, or followers over time with churches).</p>\n<p>Some upgrades like sacrifice, require both prayers and followers.</p>\n<p>Occasionally a choice will pop up, depending on the choice, morality will change, and upgrades may increase.</p>\n\n<p>Since I didn't build the credits into the game, here they are.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Forest fire background colorful cartoon<br/>BSGStudio<br/>http://all-free-download.com/free-vector/download/forest-fire-background-colorfu...</p>\n<p>Forest Background<br/>http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrEx6yvKINaFFcAcNWjzbkF;_ylu=X3oDMTBtdXBkbHJyBHNlYwNmcC1hdHRyaWIEc2xrA3J1cmw-/RV=2/RE=1518573871/RO=11/RU=https%3a%2f%2fcreativemarket.com%2fMicroOne%2f1129080-Cartoon-seamless-forest-background/RK=2/RS=OoKBjOK8JsuTuiMGRp9nmivkDH8-</p>\n<p>Cloud God Rays<br/>http://dawallpaperz.blogspot.com/2005/03/god-wallpaper-desktop-background.html</p>\n<p>God<br/>http://www.clipartbest.com/clipart-dirL7X4i9</p>\n<p>Little Church Building<br/>Liz<br/>http://sweetclipart.com/little-church-building-1351</p>\n<p>Man Face Cartoon<br/>Gerald_G<br/>https://openclipart.org/detail/386/man-face-cartoon</p>\n<p>Jail Bars<br/>http://www.clipartbest.com/clipart-9ipeXqk4T</p>\n<p>Cartoon Sheep Clip Art<br/>Kelly<br/>http://www.clker.com/clipart-175891.html</p>\n<p>Lightning Bolt Clip Art<br/>Jamie Allen<br/>http://www.clker.com/clipart-lightning-bolt-6.html</p>\n<p>Praying Hands<br/>https://pixabay.com/en/praying-hands-faith-hope-pray-2535750/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/559/559223ac083a19443ca144de77740a62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Noah Souser"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
