He will have to try and keep the doors open by making potions, with the various ingredients, scattered in crates throughout the shop. But the only way Marty can collect the ingredient in the crate is if he beats the magical game that's also inside. Time also flies so when Marty's in a pinch he can go to the mysterious merchant to buy ingredients if Marty's in a pickle. By end of day Marty will either supply people with drinks for the town or close because he can't keep the doors open. Either way he will be in for one heck of a business day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:17:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c74/c741a1ae01ac8e041501a42bbaa1f577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kadinwhitegames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
