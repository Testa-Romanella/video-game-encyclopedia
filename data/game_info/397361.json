You must survive as long as you can together; blasting asteroids.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Player use their laser pistols to shoot asteroids in order to break them up. They each have a separate health bar which is damaged if they drift into an asteroid or piece of space debris. The direction that a player shoots affects the trajectory of their spin, which may cause their partner to be hit by an asteroid or position them for a perfect shot at the life support they need.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>David\u00a0Dam: Modelling, Texturing, Lights and Coding Assistance.</li><li>Brendan Mcfarlane: UI, Sound, Art, and Coding Assistance.</li><li>David Sam: Lead Programmer, Mechanics, Implementation.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T03:37:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d581597f1df4ce8cb03738bb1bddae2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["david-sam22"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
