Each episode will revolve around a different character, so there will be more than one protagonist. The first episode will contain futuristic themes, city life, and what makes a person feel \"alive.\" The plot in these games will also be straight-forward, but if you don't take the time to explore the whole city, you could miss some important details. There are two ways to play the first game: <em>casual</em> and <em>curious</em>.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sunny Saturday</strong> is the sixth android in the NAN.AI.IRO System to be made by the ingenious Professor Amita. Once she is booted up, she is given a task by the professor to learn about the many different emotions both humans and non-humans share. However, she won't be alone on her mission. Join Saturday and her two siblings as they wander throughout the \"city that never sleeps\" and meet new and mysterious faces along the way! Make friends, help out the fellow citizens of the city, and unlock mysteries and secrets that are hiding within the concrete jungle!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tHow many emotions will you find on your trip? Who will you encounter? What things will you learn? \r\n\t<strong>It's time to get curious!</strong></p>\n<p><em>This is just a <strong>demo</strong>, as there will be later builds and an eventual full release in the future.</em> <em>There are possibilities that there might be bugs in the game, so please report it to me if you spot any! Once again, I repeat,\u00a0<strong>this is just a demo</strong>. The story in this game is incomplete, and serves as more as an\u00a0<strong>open introduction into the game's actual story</strong>. As a side-note, RPGMaker games may not be for everyone. Don't judge it when someone else plays it, but judge it by how\u00a0<strong>you</strong> play it.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d9/1d9e1064d0cba7dcdaee931cf639e981.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kura"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
