The last step of every mission is to get back to the mothership safely, which is done by finding or placing an antenna. If the antenna must be placed the players also have to defend the antenna while it builds up energy (does not apply if the antenna is already built).<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Features</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Two weapon types:<br/>The players have the choice between two weapons in the mothership.<br/>- The SMG is a high fire rate type weapon which deals a low amount of damage for every bullet but can shoot many.<br/>- The Shotgun shoots three bullets at once which deal high damage but can\u2019t be shot as often and as fast as the SMG.<br/>Mothership:<br/>The mothership functions as an interactive menu where players can test out the controls,<br/>Choose weapons, access a tutorial area, gain knowledge of the mission and embark on that mission.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team:</strong></p>\n<p>Production: Raoul Seresse Game Design: Max Raabe<br/>Level Design: Vicky Hohmuth<br/>Lead Artist: Dennis Alp<br/>Artist: Caterina W\u00f6lfle<br/>Artist: Manuela Obrist<br/>Sound: Benjamin Feder<br/>Programming: Maxi Karnstedt</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T04:27:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2cce68c680ce26ab6d74b02f08c7129.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxiMelone"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
