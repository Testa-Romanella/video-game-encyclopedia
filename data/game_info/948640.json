It is an action horror game known as Dracula's Castle. Wow, this took an extremely long time to make but I finally released alpha 2. This version contains twice as much content as the last version with 2 new floors to explore, resulting in 4 floors overall. I would consider this to have a full early game as well as a little mid-game.  I have also implemented a new mechanic: the silver stake. This is a more powerful version of the regular stake that deals twice as much damage and can pierce through up to 3 enemies, making it extremely good at defeating big groups of enemies. There are about 45 minutes of gameplay depending on skill level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T10:33:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b873df5cb96e6e54b0ef6359e3417398.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WhizmageGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
