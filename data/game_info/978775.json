{"id": 978775, "slug": "joe-dungeon", "name": "Joe Dungeon", "name_original": "Joe Dungeon", "description": "Joe Dungeon is a game about managing decisions of risk and reward. The user will have to calculate aspects such as time, distance, enemies, cards, and more when deciding a path. There are objects scattered about the level that can either help or hinder the player. The user will have to make complicated decisions during fights to ration certain cards or not. Due to the high number of varieties in decisions, each run feels fresh and unique.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Joe Dungeon is not all strategy. There are many sections in the game which require the player to avoid spikes, sawblades, fire, turrets, swinging axes, and more. There are also different difficulties in the game if one finds the current difficulty to be unsuitable for their skill level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boards are not just meant to be played once. Each board will score the player based off of their time spent and difficulty setting used. If enough points are obtained, they can be used to permanently upgrade Joe and add unique twists to the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T08:47:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6a/f6acc9230d705e12a383b42ae1d1c5ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Boulder Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Boulder Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
