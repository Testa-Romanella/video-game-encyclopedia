The world has devolved into a psuedo feudal system, corporations represent the new feudal fiefdoms and CEOs are the new kings. Society has stratified into new social classes: managers, the new lords and contractors and workers, the new serfs. Freshly 'redundant',\u00a0Victoria \"Mouse\" Hart suddenly finds herself neither. Previously contracted to the Arisana Corp as a corporate thief, she was skilled in infiltration and corporate espionage. Now she stands outside a hot dog stand in the pouring rain, seeking a new kind of work, and a little revenge on her old masters.</p>\n<p>Made in 15 days for #LOWREZJAM.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Mouse 2064 is an unforgiving shoot first or die side scroller. You have a limited number of bullets. As the levels get harder, you will have to successfully balance this fact with using your stealth, your reaction times,  hacking terminals to regenerate your energy bar, and the countdown timer, to successfully complete each.</p>\n<p>Fast completions, using less bullets and setting off less security alerts will lead to a higher score.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move - Left &amp; Right Arrow Keys, A &amp; D, Numpad 4 &amp; 6, or, Gamepad DPad (Left and Right) or Gamepad Left Stick (left &amp; right)</p>\n<p>Look - Up and Down Arrow Keys, W &amp; S, Numpad 8 &amp; 2 or Gamepad DPad (Up and Down) or Gamepad Right Stick (up &amp; down)<br/></p>\n<p>Shoot - Space, Left Mouse Button, Gamepad Right Trigger</p>\n<p>Interact/Open Doors/Hack Computers - Enter, Control, Right Shoulder or Gamepad A<br/></p>\n<p>Crouch - C, or Gamepad B</p>\n<p>Stealth - X, Shift, Gamepad X or Gamepad Left Trigger</p>\n<p>Melee - Use either Shoot or Interact within range of a Guard to melee rather than shoot them<br/></p>\n<p>Quit - Escape or Gamepad Start<br/></p>\r\nCharacters\r\n<p><strong>Mouse<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Stealthed:</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Guards</strong></p>\n<p>Guards cannot see you while you're stealthed.
