Each level has its own new type of vehicles or obstacles. A new ability is unlocked after a couple of levels ( won't spoil it for you\u00a0).\r\n</p>\n<p>There is a surprise for you at the end of the game.</p>\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The game was developed in\u00a0PICO-8, a\u00a0fantasy console that exists only in software but has almost the same limitations as the retro consoles back in the\u00a0~80s. Due to these limitations I was able to squeeze only 8 levels in the game. The cartridge of the game with all the game code, sounds and graphics\u00a0can fit in a very small .PNG image.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Pico 8 does not have built-in particle effects,\u00a0sprite rotation functionality or physics / collision detection. So I had to build my own methods, from scratch.\u00a0Although the levels might seem procedurally generated only the visual aspect of the traffic is randomly changed\u00a0each time you play.</p>\n\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n<p>Game designed and developed by Vlad Comarlau</p>\n<p>CRT shader by\u00a0Mattias Gustavsson implemented in template by\u00a0carlc27843</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:11:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4eb5a80940ddad42acfce6dfe7928602.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vladcom"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
