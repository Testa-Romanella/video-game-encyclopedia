Six Shooter was made in Unity in 5 weeks. We were inspired by action FPS games like F.E.A.R, Antarctica 88, and Dead Space and wanted to create a slower paced, narrative-driven shooter where players had to use their gun to defeat enemies and solve puzzles.\u00a0Our main goal for this project was to collect player analytics data and make improvements based on player behaviour and feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a huge learning experience for all of us and we welcome any and all\u00a0constructive feedback. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0<em>\u00a0All characters and places appearing in this work are fictitious.
