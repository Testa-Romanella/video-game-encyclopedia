{"id": 595031, "slug": "dwammings", "name": "Dwammings", "name_original": "Dwammings", "description": "<p>In <em>Dwammings</em> you get to manage a team of busy dwarves looking to mine the mountains for some sweet booze. Keep in mind, however, that powers the entire dwarven economy: it\u2019s spent to entice them to perform jobs, and to hire (read: kick out) new dwarves from your wagon, all while making sure each of them has time for a drinking break \u2014 or they\u2019ll poof out of existence. See how deep you can dig, and accumulate as much booze you can!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>At its core, <em>Dwammings</em> is about hectic management; jobs are distributed in real time, and planning ahead is crucial if you want to find your way deeper into the mountain. Dwarves are not ones to perform a job without boozy compensation, eating away quickly at your stock (and score!) should you not manage your resources efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mouse click on a dwarf to assign or remove a job.</li><li>Mouse click on the wagon to hire another dwarf.</li><li>Mouse click on bell icon to call the final booze break and end the game.</li><li>Number keys [1 - 6] to select a job.</li><li>Escape key to deselect job (job removal only mode).</li><li>Space or P keys to pause game.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Jobs</strong></p>\n<p>Pressing the number keys [1 - 6] selects a job to be assigned to a dwarf.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Digging:</strong> Dig down vertically.</li><li><strong>Mining:</strong> Dig horizontally in the dwarf\u2019s facing direction.</li><li><strong>Stop sign:</strong> Stop other dwarves from walking past and turn them back.</li><li><strong>Rope:</strong> Drop a rope down the next encountered vertical shaft.</li><li><strong>Break:</strong> Attempt to return back up, climbing ropes along the way, to take a drinking break at a nearby keg.</li><li><strong>Keg:</strong> Build a keg, allowing closer access to booze for dwarves taking a break.</li></ol>\n<p>Once selected, the booze cost for the job will be displayed. Click on a dwarf to assign them the selected job, and click them again to remove their current task. Be mindful: some jobs have a one-time cost associated with them, while others have a cost per repeated action.</p>\n<p><strong>Hazards</strong></p>\n<p>In <em>Dwammings</em>, just as in real life, dwarves die in only one way: <strong>not getting a break to drink booze</strong>. Dwarves drink in order to exist, or exist in order to drink, one or the other. Hmm. Anyway, common symptoms of dwarven sobriety are turning red, flashing red, and in severe cases, poofing into nonexistence. Be sure to provide them with a break to drink at the nearest keg, but plan accordingly: player built kegs are finite, and will run dry after some uses.</p>\n<p><strong>End Shift</strong></p>\n<p>You can always end the dwarves shift by clicking on the bell button in the bottom right corner. All dwarves will make their way up (if they can!), and your score will be tallied. Try your best to beat your previous scores!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T12:05:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb17dab8fadd504201f11bcee2a5922.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Team Foxden48"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
