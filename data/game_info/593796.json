While some first-years would be focusing on starting classes, making friends, or developing a caffeine dependency, you are looking for love in all the right places.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Romance all the wonderfully beautiful Stuart Art Collection pieces, from the shy What Hath God Wrought, the cool and collected Rock Bear, or even the braggadocious\u00a0Sun God.

Meet such eligible and attractive characters as...</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Sun God:</strong> While Sun God may appear to be just another sexy jock who loves to work out, once you get to know this all-powerful deity, you may find them to be quite the enigma. Sure they love their frat, \u03a3\u03a5\u039d, but they also value community service, and the philosophical queries they posit from classic literature are surprisingly thorough. Their body is a temple, will you get on your knees to worship?\u00a0</li><li><strong>Snake Path</strong>: UC San Diego is chock-full of nerd and dweebs, and Snake Path is no different.

And what a bright visage you see \u2014 full of passions, quiet contemplation and the knowledge that they could find out anyone\u2019s social security number, but choose not to. You don\u2019t really understand them, but that\u2019s fine. Some things don\u2019t need to be understood to be loved.\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>And all the others!\u00a0</strong>Who\u00a0could forget Silent Tree, Rock Bear, or Fallen Star?
