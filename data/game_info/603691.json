Everyone else plays as Kamikazes and have to blow up the Human player by coming as close to them as possible and exploding oneselves.</p>\n<p>Human has a rifle which can wound Kamikazes (causing them to freeze for a bit) and eliminate them. Human's default speed is slower than that of the Kamikazes, but he can outrun them by sprinting.</p>\n<p>The game has 3 maps to choose from and a number of other configurable parameters, such as the number of Kamikazes, target survival time, mouse sensitivity and music volume.</p>\n<p>The game is playable alone (with computer-controlled bots acting as Kamikazes), but is more fun in Multiplayer. <strong>Note that in order to connect to your friend via the\u00a0Internet, you must have your 7777 port forwarded in your router settings and use an IPv4 address!</strong></p>\n<p>Multiplayer supports join-in-progress and replaces Kamikaze players with bots if they leave during the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music and sound resources are from Serious Sam 4.\u00a0Explosion effect is\u00a0from a free pack on the Unity asset store. Rifle model is from Brackey's free Futuristic Weapon pack. Explosion icon is taken from Google pictures. The font used is FiraSans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All else is made by me.\u00a0The game was made in Unity utilizing Mirror as the networking module.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T10:20:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/899/8998e434e6982ce4603ab8d344ce6d0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NSKuber"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
