Thank you!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://arcadegamestudio.itch.io/</p>\n\n<p>Remember the gold rush time? Play as a tireless miner whose goal is not to be a millionaire but to reach the Earth core within 30 days.</p>\n<p>As you mine hard and discover new layer of the earth, the recipe of the new tool will be unlocked.<br/>To craft a tool, you must follow the instructions in the recipe and put the resources in the crafting slot in the correct order. In this way, the new Iron pickaxe will be crafted for you with higher mining speed than a wooden pickaxe.</p>\n<p>Your endeavors may either end in a coal mine, goldmine or even diamond mine.<br/>In terms of game control, simple enough. The bearded miner automatically start digging. You can use the left and right arrow keys to control the horizontal direction, but once you go down, you won\u2019t move up again. Therefore, make sure to move left and right to collect all the coal, iron and gold and other resources you need.<br/><br/>Mine with strategy. Don\u2019t let the land get exploited on a massive scale. Mine smarter with maximum resource collected while less land got exploited.<br/><br/>As you dig deeper into the Earth, you will face new layers that are getting harder and harder, and it will take longer to rip through. However, your miner is very dedicated, so he will continue to mine and craft hard until the pickaxe explodes.<br/><br/>Yes, you read it right. Pickaxe\u26cf\ufe0f will explode in this game. Also if you are tired of digging, you can even set up a bomb\ud83d\udca3 under your feet and blast through the layers in an explosive\ud83e\udde8 manner.<br/><br/>The retro aesthetics of pixel graphics and exciting music, coupled with simple but engaging gameplay, makes playing this game a soothing and enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>This game is simple to pick-up but difficult to master. The relaxing music and enjoyable digging will soon make you fall into an illusion, that is, dig one more day, then you can reach the final goal and put down this game. But you may not be able to achieve it once, twice\u2026<br/><br/>Again, mine smarter with your own strategies, because 30 days can be faster than you think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T05:08:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7e/d7e499ce0509352d3953dcd5d6147fa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arcade Game Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
