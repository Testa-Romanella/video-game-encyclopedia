By showing the 20sec image, my objective is to place a person in a vulnerable state. The image is meant to stay clear in the persons mind throughout the piece. The picture falls into what is been called the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d. The idea states that humanlike objects appear very similar to real humans that \u201celiciting uncanny, or strangely familiar, feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers.\u201d I believe this piece conjures a cocktail of emotions. At first the idea was to just sit, but the idea to prompt the performer with an image with twine was like a wide open door. I had many examples of this imagery and got inspired using an old YouTube video called, \u201cWhy are Things Creepy?\u201d by the Vsause channel. My other ideas were not achieving a goal or having a purpose of their own. I believe this piece uses imagery to stir a person\u2019s thought under an already uncomfortable very public environment with lots of distractions. Giving them another layer of which to make the performer want to just quit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b36/b3617b7f83ba31387e1de24b023b0193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["whsmith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
