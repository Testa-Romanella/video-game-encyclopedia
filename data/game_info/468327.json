The original releases can be found here.</p>\n<p>The algorithm generates a random tilemap that is internally consistent (i.e. no discontinuities between tiles) with a given tileset and accompanying constraint data that determines each tile's legal neighbours. You can think of it as your computer playing a game of TetraVex or\u00a0Carcassonne by itself with an unlimited number of tiles.<br/><br/>This GML implementation of the algorithm\u00a0can be used for\u00a0procedurally generating tile-based\u00a0levels and maps in <em>GameMaker\u00a0Studio 2,\u00a0</em>though it its current state, it is not production-ready yet.</p>\r\nHow to Use\r\n<ol>\n<li>Select a tileset with the\u00a0\u2190 and \u2192 buttons,</li><li>Press the Start button.\u00a0</li><li>Enter the seed you wish to use in the popup that appears\u00a0or leave it as it is.</li><li>Press OK to begin the generating the tilemap, or Cancel to go back and re-select a tileset.</li>\n</ol>\r\nArt Credits\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pipes</strong>, <strong>2-Corner Wang Tiles</strong> - M.S.T.O.P.</li>\n<li><strong>Circuit Board</strong> - M.S.T.O.P., based on the circuit board tileset from the original WFC repo by Maxim Gumin</li><li><strong>Abstract Platform</strong>, <strong>Roads</strong>, <strong>Monochrome RPG</strong> -\u00a0Kenney</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:34:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/5189a96eb9968104cfd74470a7ea72e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["M.S.T.O.P."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
