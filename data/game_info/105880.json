Coffee-break turn-based stealth inspired by Looking Glass Studios' Thief games. The randomly-generated mansions are loosely based on Chinese courtyard houses, with symmetry, enclosed gardens, and a public-to-private gradient from the entrance northward.</p>\n<p>When guards give chase, run diagonally around corners to gain distance (not unlike Pac-Man) or leap out a window.</p>\n<p>Cobbled together out of spare parts for the 2016 Seven-day Roguelike Challenge. This post-7DRL release fixes a few bugs and quality-of-life features and adds visible guard orientations.</p>\n<p>Written by James McNeill. Testing by Mendi Carroll and Mike Gaffney.</p>\n<p>Version 6 (released 2018 January 2) fixes a couple of small bugs:\u00a0a corner flanked by two windows was not getting correctly marked as visible, and investigating guards could step on top of the player if the player moved into their destination.</p><p>Version 7 (released 2018 March 4) adds a view zoom feature to help make the game easier to see on high-resolution displays. Press the 1-4 number keys to set the zoom level.</p>\n<p>Related blog posts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9a607bb48e10fcdf8cfb30f4a9fc000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James McNeill"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
