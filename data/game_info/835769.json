Propel your balloon through the increasingly convoluted obstacles and even face off against the sun in your journey through this, hmm, dungeon in the sky.<br/><br/>Not only is this game restricted to a 64x64 resolution, but also a palette of 10 colors.<br/><br/>The HTML build may run slowly, which could make it more approachable. Download one of the other builds for a buttery-smooth 60fps and the dev-intended experience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:00:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b01/b013eb4db19acc46d34d7b91192d6a56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ferociousfeind"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
