Explosive can only be placed on vertical surfaces. Once the scene is set, you can start the action phase by pressing space (just press space again if you want to go back to preparation phase). In this phase, Jean will run straight forward (and jump if facing a pit). You can activate the elements you have placed (by left-clicking on them) in the previous phase.  Explosive will make Jean jump further and higher if he is in their  detonation radius, and planes are temporary platforms that take a small  delay before arriving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Complete all six scenes to finish the game and produce the best Bollywood blockbuster ever made ! <br/></p>\n<p>This game was created by Alexaline Thomas (dev), Ponton Benjamin (dev and level designer), Prie\u00a0Am\u00e9lie (pixel artist, vfx and animation) and Viriot Ma\u00ebl (music and sfx) for the Coding Blocks game jam 2022 with the theme \"It's following me\".<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T09:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/89157c3ab2dbc257137378bea977c5d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Eddie Breeg", "Megacruxis", "BePonton"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
