In order to escape, you will have to jump and rotate your way through some of the most intense and exotic obstacles ever seen in a platformer game. Your abilities are move (left and right), jump, double jump, and rotating gravity. Although the controls are fairly simple to learn, they are quite tough to master.<h3>Features</h3><br/><br/><ul><li>Over <strong>90</strong> levels total ranging from easy to insanely difficult.<br/></li><li>One of the highest speedrunning skill caps of any known platformer. Rotating gravity can both increase your momentum and allow you to find clever shortcuts.<br/></li><li>Original soundtrack by Nikola Whallon<br/></li><li>Optional collectibles throughout the levels add even greater challenges!
