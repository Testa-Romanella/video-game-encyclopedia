{"id": 103805, "slug": "breakspace", "name": "Break/Space", "name_original": "Break/Space", "description": "<p>Break/Space is a procedurally-generated space strategy game for the 48K ZX Spectrum. The original version was written entirely in BASIC for the 2017 ZX Spectrum BASIC Jam (https://itch.io/jam/zx-spectru...), but the latest release has been compiled into 100% machine code for a slicker gameplay experience.<br/></p>\n<p>After an accident while testing an experimental warp drive, you find yourself stranded in an uncharted area of the universe. Your only chance of getting home is to recover your four warp cores (jettisoned during the accident) and then return to the wormhole that brought you here in order to get back to warp speed and back to Earth.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this part of the universe is inhabited by six alien races \u2013 some nice, some not-so-nice. You can barter and battle with these as you see fit, although be careful \u2013 your actions will have consequences, and beating up an easy mark can make them less likely to deal with you the next time your paths cross.</p>\n<p>Complicating matters more is the fact that your long-range scanners are broken so you can\u2019t see what\u2019s ahead of you until you enter a region. Your ship is also a little underpowered and can only carry a certain amount of fuel and armaments. However, it\u2019s possible to use the few supplies you have to earn money, which you can then use to replenish stocks or improve your ship. And out in the darkness of space, perhaps there are other opportunities awaiting you?</p>\n<p>But don\u2019t take too long. The wormhole will close soon, and once that happens you\u2019ll be trapped here forever!</p>\n<p><strong>Updated to version 1.9 (12/09/17).</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/6180e137308c0cd54e5a1473e59a1650.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blerkotron"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
