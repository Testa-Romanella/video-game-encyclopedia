I ended up in a crunch for time on this project so I was essentially in a \"mad-dash\" to get something put together.</p>\n\n<p>The color palette used for this game is empty_night by Enzo Gray.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS </strong>-\u00a0 (Gamepad supported)<br/></p>\n<p>A - left (Gamepad left d-pad)</p>\n<p>D - right(Gamepad right d-pad)</p>\n<p>Space - jump(X on gamepad)</p>\n<p>Shift\u00a0 (hold X)\u00a0while moving to run faster.(B on gamepad)</p>\n<p>Q\u00a0 (Left Shoulder Button)t o dash left</p><p>E\u00a0 (Right shoulder Button) to dash right</p>\n<p>You can break brick patterned blocks while dashing.</p>\n<p>Collect the yellow \"power\" orbs\u00a0 bolts\u00a0to gain dash 5 charges and 1 hp.</p>\n<p>Collect 100 coins to gain extra lives.</p>\n<p>The small drone enemies can be jumped on, but they will poke you with the spike on their sides.</p>\n<p>The floating knights can be dashed through to be defeated.

I will also be adjusting the controls to feel less \"underwatery.\" The dash mechanic will also be getting changed to a single button on both keyboard and gamepad.</p><p>***I have updated the controls, much simpler now. There is still and issues with \"lives\", but I am working to resolve this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Message </strong>from creator - I was in a \"mad-dash\" to put this project together. My time frame was very limited due to an occupational emergency. There is only 1 level at the moment. I hope that is enough to give you a feel for the game. The controls and player \"feel\" are deeply modeled after the original Super Mario Bros. game with the added mechanic of dashing in mid-air. As usually I have plans to continue production on this project so please leave me any suggestions or comments. Constructive feedback only makes\u00a0 us better developers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T10:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad7a9f466dc9b65d48e26f2d60b33534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
