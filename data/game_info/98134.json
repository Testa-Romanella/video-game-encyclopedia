The group was devastated but I offered to get the only cure....The heart of a Demogorgon. A ferocious beast that traps his victims in a separate reality. These beasts like to play with their prey before hunting them down.<br/><br/>   Jenni didn't like the idea but it's the group that really shoves the pressure down your throat. Maybe they are right, Barren's life is in my hands. And if I don't save his life, my existence here with these people will become hell.<br/><br/>The whole group can go to hell. Making me feel I need to do this shit. I'm probably the only bad-ass in this god forsaken group.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8c/f8c113f934b4b0db1651e8a3a580e013.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jeremy Perkins"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
