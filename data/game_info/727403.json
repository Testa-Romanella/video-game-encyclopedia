{"id": 727403, "slug": "jumpilla", "name": "Jumpilla", "name_original": "Jumpilla", "description": "Jumpilla is a simple but fun game where you control a jumping gorilla. It's an auto runner, so you don't control the speed or direction of Jumpilla. You only decide when to jump and the length of the jump with a mouse click. Longer you press the mouse bigger the jump will be. You need to be as accurate as you can because in some levels if you jump more/less than you should, then Jumpilla will fall into the void and you will lose.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll levels are designed carefully by the developer and played many times. They can get quite tricky to pass and are not repetitive or boring. Real fun to dodge the rocks, fires and holes to get to your target.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n60 carefully designed levels for your enjoyment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T03:40:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee7/ee7356c4322dbd1a8298e1e99963acc6.jpg", "website": "https://games.aliustaoglu.biz/#/jumpilla", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cuneyt Aliustaoglu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Usta Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
