The player has limited vision and has to be beware of the wind , fire and other obstacles.</p>\r\nThe map has 2 regions - Windy and Firey. Windy region slows the player. Firey region has fire pits which damage the player. Is there a path connecting them ?Hmmmm...\r\n<p>The game has <strong>inbuilt LeaderBoard</strong> thanks to lootlocker.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>1. ARROW KEYS / WASD to move left, right , jump and slide</p>\n<p>2. W/ UP ARROW twice for double jump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0AIM:</p>\n<p>1. Try to avoid the obstacles and reach the end. There are multiple ways to reach the end . Look at the map in left corner. Find the best possible route</p>\n<p>2. Pipes and obstacles cause less damage. Fire causes more damage. A health bar is the right corner</p>\n<p>3. You will have limited light in the main level.</p>\n<p><strong>PS: The 1st level is a training level to get the player to know about the game and controls. This level is a bit glitchy (sorry for that)</strong></p>\n<p>GOOD LUCK</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0https://www.free-stock-music.com/parkour-introvert.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T09:01:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcc/bcc3cd594f4fb05cadc3d95a1e327eb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fasith"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
