The game is ongoing since June), and it is that same 'Peyo' known as the 'Goalkeeper ' (v2.0.0). I was able to get it for review by asking Outhouse Media to send me the screenshot below.<br/>\nGoalkeepers were created in WoW. Throughout the history of the game, there have been different groups assigned to work in different areas of the game such as the frontline, the center, and the backline, but generally, the goalkeepers were in charge of the backline, center, and the frontline. The name 'Peyo' is due to a large number of references within the game such as 're-creation', 'time' and 'Uses of Yohei', which is the name of an item in WoW.\n\nEverything you see in the screenshot is that of the front line and the center line respectively, and they contain an enormous amount of different changes. The picture to the left is a screenshot from the Newbie mode when playing the game which put everything in place for the frontline and centerline to be constant. This particular screenshot shows the eight different positions of the goalie. The hat is the centre line one, with the gloves on top of the gloves. That is Blizzard's style of protecting the center.\n\nThe picture to the right is the middle line, the line of responsibility. The center and backline rotate individually, and that makes a lot of cogs in</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:21:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdbfb918a0f3aea46048bf04d9fde0f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
