Yet, I'm aware of only two examples trying to answer that question.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One example is a video (Portal through Itself - MinutePhysics). While this is certainly a great video, due to the passive nature of a video one cannot explore these portals by themself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other example is Portal through Itself - Optozorax. I know this program was available in the past, but somehow I can't find it anywhere, anymore. Also, in this case one could not actually go through the portals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because of that, I decided to make my own implementation. Hope someone has some fun with it and let me know if there are other cases of portals in portals that I'm not aware of (or if the second example is still available somewhere). <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Escape, M: open/close menu<br/>Alt+F4: quit application (not in browser)<br/>Mouse: look around<br/>W, A, S, D, Q, E: move camera forward, left, backward, right, down, up<br/>T, F, G, H, R, Y: move red portal<br/>I, J, K, L, U, O: rotate red portal<br/>shift, space: increase movement and rotation speeds</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only the red portal can be moved into the green portal.
