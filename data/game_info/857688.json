{"id": 857688, "slug": "crypt-3", "name": "Crypt", "name_original": "Crypt", "description": "If you've found this game by chance through Steam, I advise you not to play it.<br/>My name is Valefisk, and I'm a YouTuber. I made this game as a joke - it's not designed to be fun, but to be awful to play. And in this it succeeds.<br/>This version that has found its way to Steam is slightly different from the one in the original video. This one is beatable.<br/><br/>Personally I think the way this game is best played is with you making someone else play it with no context as to what the game contains. It presents itself (successfully) as a real indie game until you really start to play it, so feel free to torture your friends with this abomination of an experience.<br/><br/><strong>Enter the Crypt.</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Retrieve the Essence and Make your Escape.</strong><br/>The objective is - on the surface - simple. Steal the jar from the Crypt and then make your escape. The idea is easy, but finding all the keys wont be.<br/></li><li> <strong>Solve the Puzzles.</strong><br/>Can you actually solve the puzzles necessary to access the keys to escape? Sure you can. Does the game include any actual helpful information as to how to solve them? Of course not. Trust your instincts, and not your eyes.<br/></li><li> <strong> Survive Him.</strong><br/>You are not alone down within the Crypt. Someone or something is there with you - and it's never too far behind you.<br/></li><li> <strong> Escape! </strong><br/>Once you've gotten all the keys, you can finally open the door to Escape...assuming you've done everything right. I mean, I put an achievement in for winning so it's definitely possible - perhaps you've simply missed a nasty prerequisite...</li></ul><br/>Good luck.
