You control your focus, and must navigate your way to the 'breathe in' and 'breathe out' pick ups in order to focus on your breathing. Breathing lessens your tension which builds up over time, if you let your Tension get too high, you will lose the game. Avoid intrusive thoughts as they will increase your Tension. You win if you successfully Meditate for 2 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD or Left Analogue Stick\u00a0for movement</p>\n<p>This game was made for the BTP gamejam #3, The Theme is \"Less is More\".
