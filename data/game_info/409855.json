I still have a few unimplemented ideas such as character models, animations, more enemies, and maybe a small puzzle element. Sadly these were cut for low time. Still had fun making this. It was a good change having a short deadline to have a completed project, rather than allowing myself to focus on an aspect of a personal project for 12 hours and not get much done. Thank you for playing my submission!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T03:09:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f5e130173d5cde9e3f3c5ac22101584.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ADHD_ADVERSARY"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
