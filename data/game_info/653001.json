Welcome to the city of the future!\r\n<p><strong>The game has 3 distinct levels:</strong><br/><strong>Cairo</strong> - the city of pyramids, is the most beginner-friendly and comes with an <strong>interactive tutorial</strong>.<br/><strong>Paris</strong> - the city of love, has a strange foundation shape that encourages organic buildings.<br/><strong>New York</strong> - the city of opportunities, has a really tiny foundation, that provides quite a lot of challenges.<br/><br/><strong>Building Blocks:</strong></p>\n<p>1. <strong>Containers</strong> - main building blocks of any city. Use Q and E to rotate and lock them securely. One container fits 4 people.<br/>2. <strong>Solar Panel</strong> - containers alone are inhabitable. Attach solar panels to provide a cosy living space.<br/>3. <strong>Cables</strong> - are versatile tools, they can connect multiple containers and share energy between them. They can also be secured to the platform providing more stability to tall structures.<br/>4. <strong>Buoys</strong> - initially the foundation is stable enough to support many containers. But it becomes unstable once the mass gets too high. Add Buoys to lift more weight and avoid dipping.<br/><br/>Enjoy the relaxing view and gameplay!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T05:00:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0fdc1dc15f4f7ee40962d7f8c7ec6f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Perfoon"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
