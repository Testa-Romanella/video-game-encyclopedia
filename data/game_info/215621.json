I came up with this concept a long time ago. It is a story telling game\u00a0combined with light projection and puzzles. You will need to project proper mark on the objects in the scene in order to help the story to\u00a0 progress. You will gather new marks during the game, and you'll even need to combine multiple projections together to solve puzzles.</p>\n<p>But due to my busy work, I didn't have much of time to make. So I just built up a concept game from scratch within my limited time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm really happy to join in this jam. And\u00a0I really hope you can find something interesting in this game.\u00a0 \u00a0Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/462/46275b381c40db6ffe1fa7397880d64f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bensonhero"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
