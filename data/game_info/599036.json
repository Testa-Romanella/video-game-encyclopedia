Five stars!!\"<br/><br/>Speedygomes \u2014 \"Very Smart Trainer - Asha is 18 mths old and just loves this.

There are a bunch of different songs for free, just download. There's others to purchase if you want.You can record your creations and even email them to people. Pretty cool!I connect my iPad to my stereo system through a 3.5mm plug out from the headphone jack, and I can create music of my own at high volume. My daughter seems to like the techno beats the best, and I prefer making funk music. Totally cool app! Best of the 70 or so apps I have on the iPad so far.\"<br/><br/>Woeisrose \u2014 \"great fun! - The whole family likes to play with this.\"<br/><br/>Majandess \u2014 \"So Much Fun! - I bought this for my three year old son to play with, but everyone in the family loves to play! The music is catchy, the interface is simple, and making your own mixes can occupy you for hours. Thank you!!\"<br/><br/>Kathtea \u2014 \"Fantastic. - The description says kids' songs but they are a pleasure to listen to - i.e. never annoying. It's a brilliant and simple introduction to arrangement and the layers of music. My little one adores this app; he loves composing and playing and I love hearing the tunes. My only (little) criticism is that two of the tunes are almost identical...\"<br/><br/>margaret pomeroy \u2014 \"Baby dj - It's fun", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T04:38:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f3/9f30adf13b473c0100c2431a9ce54f6b_Oj0QUSr.jpg", "website": "http://www.babydj.ru", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["APPLIFTO"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["APPLIFTO"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
