Those who do not believe believe that witches are inconvenient people who should have been removed, those who believe believe that witches are a cancer of society. But has anyone wondered who they really are? What did they feel? Why were they hated?</p>\n<p>Alex: An Adventure Between the Ages is an adventure game in which you will meet Alex, who will have to unravel the whole story and end the curse. You are waiting for skirmishes with ghosts, a lot of puzzles, a funny, but no less terrifying storyline, and much, much more. Try to look around more often, because no one knows where the trouble will be: maybe in an abandoned house, maybe on the street at night, or maybe... maybe even in your own house.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T13:27:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4cef240123c9769c058cfb5fc0df284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanHryGame7"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
