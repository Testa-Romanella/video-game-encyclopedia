Broaden your horizon in this new perspective on a puzzle video game, where the whole idea is to look at the puzzles from different points of view in order to solve them. Like in real life, if you look at a problem through a different lens, everything changes!</p>\n<p>You can run the game on your browser or download the executable for better performance.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was submitted for the Godot Fire Jam 1.<br/></p>\r\nFree and open source!\r\n<p>As in the spirit of Godot, this game is free and open source, with the MIT license for its code and CC0 for its assets. Feel free to \u00a0clone its repository and look through the project and see how we achieved all of its features, from the trippy looking shaders and the crazy perspective changing levels that ignore depth, both on the screen and in the gameplay. I believe that everybody wins if we share our knowledge with each other.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T05:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f2/0f2f6256307feaa825f6c96820e946d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Rafael Bordoni", "Ayrton Sato"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
