The project was an attempt to build my skills as a game maker and successfully complete my first game project.\r\n</p>\n<p>Asteroid Ambush is played almost exactly as you may remember it but with some nuances. And there is an extra weapon feature and bonus item not found in the original game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Move left and right with the arrow keys and attack with the spacebar. Get hit by an asteroid (or its exploding debris) and you'll be knocked out! Then it's time to rapidly hit the spacebar to recover and keep clearing out the asteroids!\r\n</p>\n<p>Destroy asteroids near one another and the debris will start a chain reaction for even more bonus points! If the asteroids start bouncing too low to shoot, hit the Down Arrow Key to fire a shockwave and clear out those pesky \"low lifes\".\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is FREE TO PLAY (out of respect to Nintendo and SquareEnix) but I retain all design credit (along with the artists and composer) for this version of the game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T06:35:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a78dfd0d57a65e9535942ce14779199.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["XionDevGroup"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
