{"id": 963745, "slug": "slugs-and-bugs-conversion", "name": "Slugs and Bugs: Conversion", "name_original": "Slugs and Bugs: Conversion", "description": "If you are tired of the normal everyday adult games with virtually the same stories and cliches- then I invite you to try something fresh, unique, and darker.  Like all Anaxverse games, this one revolves around corruption and transformation fetishes! Slugs and Bugs: Conversion is essentially an adults-only sexual trainer game.  As the Over-Master, you must convert the women into your loyal alien harem before the human forces, Wyatt's Warriors, can save them.  It allows a choice between a Story Mode (avoiding all turn-based combat and resource management) for casual play, or a Game Mode for those that want to breed alien spawn with the women to protect your hive and fight daily battles against your foes.  This is a noncanonical Anaxverse title based on the canon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The main gameplay aspect of SB:C is converting the different women into your personal harem slaves.  There are a total of eight women, each from a different Anaxverse interactive novel.  Now, you can see what would have happened, noncanonically, if the Infectulons had managed to bring all these heroines together in one place.  By dropping the women into different chambers, you can increase their conversion and watch a sexy scene play out.  As their conversion level rises, they become shells of their former selves until finally converted into your personal minions.  Convert them all!<br/><br/><br/><br/>You have a choice, like in all Anaxverse games.  Do you want to relax, kick back, and simply convert the women without needing to worry about creating units, defending the hive, and a possible Game Over?  Choose Story Mode!  However, if you want to try and juggle converting the lovely ladies while impregnating them and breeding armies of infectulonian creatures, staving off daily attacks from the pathetic human forces- and want to do it on a timer- risking your triumph for a bad end- you can choose Game Mode and test your skills!<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Game Mode, you will fight a Battle Phase at the end of every day.  If you are as cunning as you are evil, you will learn which units to breed and use against the attacking mortals.  Different units, both your superior infectulonian ones and the puny human units, have strengths and weaknesses.  In the Battle Phase, you can gain even more units by converting the attacking humans to your cause.  Enslave them, corrupt them, and make the puppets fight their former friends!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Whether in Story Mode or Game Mode, your mission is clear, you must convert the females into your fold.  There are many different chambers, and each woman, based on her Anaxverse lore, has strengths and weaknesses.  Find a woman's weakness, and you can convert her much faster!  If in Game Mode, if you dawdle too long, you will likely be wiped out by the humans.  Find what works best on each woman and turn them into your pets!  Once they are converted, they move from the Prison Chamber to the Harem Chamber, and there you can enjoy their transformed forms.  You can even have them enjoy themselves with each other as they revel in their new, superior bodies!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, the game also features the Memory Chamber.  Here you can witness every scene you have unlocked throughout the game.  Think of it as a gallery of sorts.  But wait!  There's more!  As with all my Anaxverse games, there are commissioned Bad Ends purchased by fans and added for your pleasure.  You can find these in the Memory Chamber as well.  With the Bad Ends, you get to see many different \"What If\" scenarios and enjoy corruption from all new angles.  In all, this title will take hours to finish, and you are bound to find a lot of fun along the way.  So, what are you waiting for?  Create your harem of alien women and conquer the Earth, today!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T06:08:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc6/cc609309a7f9957e8545228b6f22f9f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 514, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Anaximanes Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Anaximanes Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
