He must blast, control time and jump his way through the levels to reach the last sunset he may ever see.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Moments Machine's Mechanics<br/></em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>When you shoot in game, time slows down itself, allowing for RoBoB to breach and clear rooms without a scratch.</li><li>Slowing down time interacts with other things, such as increasing the enemies fire rate to not make it a walk in the park &amp; extending RoBoB's special rocket fuse so it doesn't blow up so soon. Doing this encourages players to go into slow motion &amp; give time to think before making the next move.</li><li>And many more!!!
