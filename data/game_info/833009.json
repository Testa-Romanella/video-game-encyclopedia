The twist? You see through the hostile ship. Also, make sure not to go too far out of the planets, or you'll die.</p>\n<p>Controls are also simple. Move the ship with WASD and reset the demo with R.</p>\n<p>This was pretty fun to make. I'll link a video with the details if you'd like to see how I did it.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T15:01:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bdce84a614b42a0acb545709735ce6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["r3sgame"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
