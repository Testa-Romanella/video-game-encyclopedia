It didn\u2019t particularly end well for them, and to be honest, things aren\u2019t exactly great for another Jack and Jill either.<br/><br/>In Jack N\u2019 Jill DX, players must assume the role of Jack, overcoming many hazards, in a bid to reach Jill, who awaits him at the end of 140 levels, in typical old-school one-button platformer fashion! But, for the players who feel the guy should be the one who needs saving, we absolutely agree and that\u2019s why Jill is available as a playable character as well! All you need to do, to play as her, is swap the graphics and hey presto, the change is complete!<br/><br/>Whoever you choose to play as, as you run and jump to your friend\u2019s rescue across 7 worlds, you will do so to the sound of a chiptune soundtrack that will transport you back to the golden age of video gaming. But the old school feels, don\u2019t end there. With grey-scale monochrome graphics and easy to learn controls, yet addictive gameplay, it will even feel like a game straight up from the days of old, as well. Will you rise to the challenge of reuniting them?Features<ul><li> 7 worlds made up of 20 levels each<br/></li><li> 7 in-game mini-games., where you can earn tickets for the in-game store<br/></li><li> 1 button gameplay<br/></li><li> In-game store with in-game tickets that are used for unlocking hats and screen colours<br/></li><li> Mirror Mode<br/></li><li> 2 Playable characters</li></ul>Deluxe Improvements<ul><li> Improved GFX<br/></li><li> improved Music<br/></li><li> Upgraded in-game stuff</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T21:45:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/046cd7ad2a00d8974192e3ecfcef57d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.2, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 132, "beaten": 18, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 130, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 30, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PS Vita", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Ratalaika Games", "Rohan Narang"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ratalaika Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
