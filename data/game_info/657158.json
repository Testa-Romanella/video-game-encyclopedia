{"id": 657158, "slug": "sync-it", "name": "Sync it!", "name_original": "Sync it!", "description": "<p>A throwback to the 20th century, when two players actually had to share a computer and screen when playing a two player game. Players must follow an object through a level, never getting too far ahead or behind or the music changes in tempo. The music clips for each level are classical piano pieces, but the players are assigned right (blue player) and left hand (red player). The controls are standard w,a,d and cursor keys respectively.</p>\n<p>This version here is a bit more difficult than I originally intended. It is my contribution to the Brackeys game jam 2021 \"Let there be chaos\". The tempo changes are really tough and getting back in sync is very hard (btw, you don't have to to that to complete a level; you can also simply play it as a short and silent jump and run--just don't collide with the notes object at the beginning of each level). So musical chaos is practically guaranteed. After the game jam, I will upload an easier version, probably with some additions to the game (collectibles, scores, ...). I'd appreciate any constructive feedback/ criticism/ suggestions/...<br/></p>\n<p>I did the coding, design, animations and most of the artwork. The tileset was taken from a Brackeys tutorial and then I made some changes. It seemed fitting to use a poiece of artwork by Brackeys in his game jam. The music pieces sound very monotonous, because they are atually not performed by a human, but played by musescore. (This shouldn't sound too negative--it is an awesome app that I totally recommend. ) The programs/platforms I used were musescore, Unity (with Visual Studio), paint.net, and piskel.<br/></p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>title screen: Chopin waltz a minor (left hand, synthesizer, only a few bars)</p>\n<p>Mozart level: 3rd movement from the sonata in A major (Turkish march)</p>\n<p>Bach level: Prelude C major</p>\n<p>Chopin level: Prelude e minor</p>\n<p>training level: Beethoven \"For Elise\" (only the first theme)</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff0b008c0786dd20e30eae763afab8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["vh-games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
