{"id": 56742, "slug": "robotfindskitten", "name": "robotfindskitten", "name_original": "robotfindskitten", "description": "<p>robotfindskitten is a \"Zen simulation\", originally written by Leonard Richardson for MS-DOS. It is a free video game with an ASCII interface in which the user (playing the eponymous robot and represented by a number sign \"#\") must find kitten (represented by a random character) on a field of other random characters. Walking up to items allows robot to identify them as either kitten, or any of a variety of \"Non-kitten Items\" (NKIs) with whimsical, strange or simply random text descriptions. It is not possible to lose (though there is a patch that adds a 1 in 10 probability of the NKI killing robot). Simon Carless has characterized robotfindskitten as \"less a game and more a way of life ... It's fun to wander around until you find a kitten, at which point you feel happy and can start again\".</p>\n<p>The original robotfindskitten program was the sole entrant to a contest in 1997 at the now-defunct webzine Nerth Pork \u2014 the object: create a depiction of \"robotfindskitten\". (The \"robotfindskitten\" concept was originally created by Jacob Berendes, but the only submission he received depicted kittens meeting an untimely end at the hands of malevolent robots.)</p>\n<p>When the author rewrote the program for Linux in 1999, it gained popularity and now has its own website and mailing lists. Since then, it has been ported to and/or implemented on over 30 platforms, including POSIX, the Dreamcast, Palm OS, TI 99/4A, the Z-machine, the Sony PSP, Android, and many more. Graphical versions, such as an OpenGL version with # emblazoned on an otherwise featureless cube, also exist. Remakes of it are also used as programming tutorials, such as for Gambas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21a/21ab1612c86935e5220fe14c5a719a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Classic Macintosh", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC", "Linux", "Dreamcast", "Android", "Apple II"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
