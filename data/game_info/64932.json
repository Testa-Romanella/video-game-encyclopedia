Enter an immersive world... wait, that's not right. What's the opposite of immersive? Never mind, let's start over.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnter a world... no, I think world is too strong of a word also, so......... ughhh....<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOk, you're trapped in a room. But don't worry, I've given you all the tools you need to get out. Well, tool. This isn't a complicated game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, you're in a room, right? And there's a door. You'll recognize it, even though the graphics are so bad that it doesn't look like a door. That's because there is a sign in front of it that says \"EXIT\" and has an arrow pointing to the previously described door. So you'll just open that and everything will be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOH NO, IT'S LOCKED!!! Why would a cruel game developer do this to you?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWait a minute, I think I see something on the other side of the room. Multiple somethings, in fact. Maybe one of those things can help...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n- Six things that you can pick up!<br/>\r\n- Five Steam Achievements!<br/>\r\n- Four original pieces of music!<br/>\r\n- Three possible endings!<br/>\r\n- Two gratuitous exclamation points!!!<br/>\r\n- One fire!<br/>\r\n- Zero quality!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo don't be a negative one, play Doors Quest Demo today. It is positively a thing!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMature content warning: This game contains violence, blood, death, alcohol, and swearing.
