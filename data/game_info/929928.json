I\u00b4m not a 3D artist so the most assets\u00a0in this game are from the unreal market place and only some are made by myself. The music and (most) SFX are made by me.</p>\n<p>Please use the saving system with caution, there could still be some bugs especially with the number of enemys spawned. If you have issues just restart the game.</p>\n<p>I\u00b4ve added graphic settings you can lower if you have performance issues. I still need to optimize the performance so I recommend a resolution of 1920x1080 or lower on low settings for higher FPS (depending on your system).</p>\n<p>The map isn\u00b4t working 100% accurate in some areas, but it should be accurate enough to navigate.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>To exorcise the haunted crypt you need to find 3 runes on the graveyard aereal first. But other ghosts will notice and hunt you! The more runes you have the faster you should run.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T13:59:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbb/cbbf5da1a154c9725f9eff94141bbb4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nemwaz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
