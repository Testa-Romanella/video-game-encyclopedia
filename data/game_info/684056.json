When I started making the project I was inspired by the idea of using color to solve puzzles. But because the theme was Foddian games I threw in some hell. The graphics are inspired by an old flash game called the worlds hardest game.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0use jams to try something new so I\u00a0tried implementing a backend for a leaderboard and puzzle style level design. I\u00a0learned a lot and am looking forward to your feedback. I\u00a0loved making this and will 100% do a post jam build.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leaderboard: The name you enter at the start will be your name in the leaderboard, you can update your name by refreshing the page if you want to change it. The name seems to not show up if it is under 4 characters long, if you get a bug where your name doesnt show up in the leaderboard refresh the page and try a different name. The name will update in the leaderboard as well.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T07:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e6175e9f7bb78078634a3722ec132e51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Simpathey"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
