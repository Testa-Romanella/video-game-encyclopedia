A key will drop after it is completed to open the next room.</p>\n<p>The yellow barriers indicate that a key is needed before progressing further.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Quick, small dungeon crawler featuring Fisk, a metal shard (scissor). The original concept was to include Stubby (rock) and Kiri (paper) to complete the rock, paper, scissors theme. It features boss fights, room exploration, and fighting mobs within a ruined temple. Explore the abandoned crypts, destroy mobs such as bats, frogs, and massive spiders, and complete objectives to move on to the next arena!<br/></p>\n<p>This game is reminiscent of the classic structure of dungeon crawlers and adventure games.</p>\n<p><strong>Postmortem:</strong></p>\n<p>What went right?</p>\n<p>We are especially proud of the enemy AI system, the objective system, and the UX such as saving, loading, pausing, and the menu screen along with SFX and music.</p>\n<p>We pride ourselves on the atmosphere of the game with our handpicked assets and tilesets along with our sound effects and music selection.<br/></p>\n<p>What went wrong?</p>\n<p>Trying to shoot too high when we only have shotguns: We planned to design 30 levels, but only managed 3 levels. We wanted to have 3 playable characters as mentioned but only managed to develop Fisk fully in the end.<br/></p>\n<p>Communication: way too few meetings over the course of the semester</p>\n<p>Loss of members: We lost our artist and producer halfway through the project. Had to narrow down concepts and redesign the game afterward to accommodate the workload among all members.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The Inanimate War demo was a class project. It resembles a basic dungeon crawler. We used a wide range of sprites found on this platform to build the game. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T11:07:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e5/5e5c1bba911f1133754657caee331125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oeppert"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
