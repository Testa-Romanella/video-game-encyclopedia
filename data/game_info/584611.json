Indeed, as you know, after the overpopulation of Mars in 2120 and the third moon's war, few human colonies remained after the total destruction of planet Earth caused by the war on natural resources. The colony of Venus, in which it excelled after the inclusion of Japan to the Allies and the Russian base, located on the largest moon of Jupiter: Ganymede (Jupiter III) was utterly destroyed.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Ganymede had already become promising since the discovery of a thin layer of oxygen in its atmosphere, together with its magnetic field. However, due to the haste and fear of many, its colonization was precocious and kept secret (the fate of Venus served as an example). Without even having explored its entirety in a few days, the scientific team led by Kurchatov/\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 discovered some telluric movements that couldn\u2019t be explained by Ganymede geology, this was the premise of the discovering of an alien pest \u00a0that lurked in every shadow of the moon.\r\n</p>\n<p>The few who faced these mysterious apparitions were considered brave and fearless, because it was not known how or where they came from, nor were there even people who survived their enclosure.\r\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, not only these shadow creatures, but also a disease caused by soot of unknown origins affected the small Russian colony. Thus, many who were exposed began to go crazy and become uncontrollable and aggressive, forcing them to wear special masks for oxygen, so as not to be exposed to this contamination.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Engineering Area, (Andre\u00ef Dimitrievitch Flyorov), report #1522 2135y, Base Veliky\u00ef Svet. \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442<br/>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Controllers:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD \u2192 Movement\u00a0</li><li>Space \u2192 Interact</li><li>F \u2192 Use Item</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Art: <em>martinusprime92i#8529</em></li><li>Management &amp; Support: <em>Feripei#4038</em></li><li>Programming: <em>renanruan#3958</em></li><li>Sound Effects:\u00a0<em>samaquias#8763</em><br/>\n</li></ul>\n<p>P.S.:\u00a0Don't forget the lantern.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jam Disclaimer: The jam version (72h) is the ChernoBog.zip file.
