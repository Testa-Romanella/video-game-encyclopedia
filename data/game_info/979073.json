Once seen as the greatest invention of the 1800's, the Tempus Rail was a vast locomotive that breached the temporal rift and gifted it's passengers eternal life. Free from consequence and even death, the passengers aboard the Tempus Rail travelled the temporal streams at the precise speed to reset time each day. But when the maiden voyage ended and it was time to leave the temporal rift, the train never stopped. Now countless cycles beyond, the train has devolved into chaos with few who have held their sanity. <br/><br/>As one of these lucky (or unlucky) few who find themselves barricaded in the rear of the train, you must fight your way to the front of the train in the hopes of stopping the train before days end.<h3>Deck-Builder</h3>Fight your way through deadly carriages using a turn-based combat system in which your deck holds the key to your survival. Collect rare and powerful cards on your journey from fallen enemies, or through optional story missions and quests. Start each run with a different deck as you unlock and discover more abilities tied to the mysterious crystal shards that grow on the outside of the train.<br/><br/><h3>Death Is Not The End</h3>Cursed with eternal life, each death is just an opportunity for progression as you awake in your bed again each morning. Do not expect the encounters to be the same each day as factions beyond the barricade fight for control in a never ending conflict.<br/><br/><h3>A Wild West Unlike Our Own</h3>Fight your way through a world scarred with the technological advancements unseen in our own history books. Encounter machines awakening to their own existence and those who seek modifications to themselves that would be deemed most unholy.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T06:50:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d2486b4afb5953d20d403fee7743b09.jpg", "website": "https://pixeldripgames.com.au/tempus-rail", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixel Drip Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Pixel Drip Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
