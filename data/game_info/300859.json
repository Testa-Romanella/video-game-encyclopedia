Definitely one of my new favourites!\" 5/5 by led - US App Store review<br/><br/>\"Super simple and addicting. The perfect game to play when I'm bored! thanks dev team!\" 5/5 by Sicstik13 - US App Store review<br/><br/>\"A challenging game with nice controls. Easy gameplay that gets challenging as you move up the levels.\" 5/5 by Brian976 - US App Store review<br/><br/><br/>Volleyball Pong is a multi-level arcade game that's intuative to play - you simply drag your paddle across your side of the court to deflect the ball over the net into your opponent's half. As you progress through the levels the game speed increases and the computer player gets tougher to beat.<br/><br/>Your paddle is curved so you can direct the ball over the net and you score goals by getting the ball to hit the floor in your opponent's side. You can bounce the ball off the back-wall or net and you have unlimited touches in your own half - just don't score an own goal!<br/><br/>The 2 player game is awesome and you can choose the speed of the game from the pedestrian 'slow' to the insane 'ultra-fast'.<br/><br/>The single-player game has a World Record for the highest level that's been won - see if you can match it or even beat it! You start with 3 lives and you only lose a life if you lose a game to the computer. If you lose all 3 lives you can upgrade to unlimited lives.<br/><br/>Tip: Accelerate into the ball for extra power.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2b/c2b0777ac35610b4dd61dd54b3aa2836_f6ujjpA.jpg", "website": "https://www.perrins.co.uk/volleyballpong/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Paul Perrins"], "genres": ["Sports", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Paul Perrins"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
