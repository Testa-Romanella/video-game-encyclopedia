Place your pranks to lower his health to zero or beat him to your goal tile to win!</p>\n<p>The game starts with the prank palette.\u00a0 Place all of your pranks on tiles to maximize damage to Mr. Chuckles. Your prank inventory consists of 6 Whoopie Cushions (1 pt damage each), 4 banana peels (2 pts of damage each), 2 boxing gloves (3 pts of damage each), and one joy buzzer(4 pts of damage).</p>\n<p>Once all of your pranks are placed, the race is on. You and Mr. Chuckles will take turns moving one square at a time to your individual goals. You can only move your player one square at a time so you must click on a square adjacent to your current square in order to move. Also, you can only walk on the stone, NOT on the grass.\u00a0Whoever gets to the goal first or is the last one standing wins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was designed and built from scratch by a father and son for the Weekly Game Jam #247: April Fools. This was our first game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T10:56:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/9880d1ded0bce2c72465a0f0c0f1a361.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JollySquidLips"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
