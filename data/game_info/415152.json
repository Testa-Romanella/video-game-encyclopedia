Eventually, I made this homage to Flappy Bird in 2014. This was coded using Endurion's C64 Studio IDE.<br/><br/>It's a bit rough around the edges, with some glitchy sprites on the pipes, but it's playable enough and is a tricky highscore chaser.<br/><br/>I never bothered to put on a front end. It's straight in with the game with this one.<br/><br/>There are \"cracked\" versions available with a highscore saver added that will save your best to disk.<br/><br/></p><p>This game can be downloaded for free, but if you would like to donate, that's cool. When the pool reaches $100 it will go to charity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T06:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd11f7c18a96c9fe818f1eb99ecd0883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roysterini"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
