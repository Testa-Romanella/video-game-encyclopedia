The second IG Dragon Knight is a 2D side-scrolling action game with Rogue-like random elements. From the sketch design of original characters and monsters, you could probably guess that I am a big fan of MH series games. Yes, from P2 till now, my path to hunter has never stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSmooth striking is pretty important for an action game, which is also a great challenge for me. Now my idea is to try to make a game with more violence aesthetics. Besides, I can design weapons and equipment based on monsters\u2019 characteristics. Characters can not only change their appearance but also obtain skills and attributes randomly after picking up the equipment, which gives you a new experience every time you replay it. Rampage Knights and Lost Castle did a great job on that aspect, which have given me great help and inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOf course, all of the above is just the beginning of my dream, your participation and encouragement are what really matters in order for this rough beta version to evolve, step by step, into a genuinely unique and excellent game. Thank you all again for your support!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMain Game Features:<br/>\r\n\u25a0 Plenty of Rogue-Like random elements<br/>\r\n\u25a0 Randomly generated passes, equipment and monsters<br/>\r\n\u25a0 Elaborately designed Boss combat, pretty exciting <br/>\r\n\u25a0 Inspired from the Ultimate Skill in Mortal Kombat, add violence aesthetics-reflecting special skills in the combat.<br/>\r\n\u25a0 Over 200 weapons, using different weapons will produce different moves and skills<br/>\r\n\u25a0 Over 20 armors, changing armors will also change character\u2019s appearance, moreover, if character is being continuously struck by enemies, the armor will be destroyed", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-29T14:54:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2a6572e317a6bd288087cf3c9a1e883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.44, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 246, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 488, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SakuraGame"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SakuraGame"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
