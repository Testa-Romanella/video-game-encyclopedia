First version - Basically unplayable. I plan to add much more stuff and flesh it out. This is a prototype.</p>\n<p>You can deploy units and order them around. You can call in bombardment and you can try to predict how the virus will spread. You need to try to contain it no matter the cost.</p>\n<p>Currently doesn't even have an end-goal. If you win you just kinda are done lol.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T12:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/70814555af96422d218e1c7c96cc512f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shoofe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
