Heavy inspiration for gameplay comes from games such as Metroid, Megaman, Celeste, and Hyper Light Drifter.</p>\n<p>Even though the jam lasted for a whole month, the game is fairly short and not terribly difficult. Not every planned feature was able to make it into this build. We hope you enjoy playing through it as much as we enjoyed making it!</p>\n<p><strong>There are plans to\u00a0make it into a full game. This page will be updated later with more information about it.
