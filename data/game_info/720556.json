Get to turn 200 with over 70 happiness and win!</p><p><strong>How To Play<br/></strong>To keep happiness up and win the game the player must manage four variables.</p><p><strong>GDP</strong>\u00a0(Wealth Produced by Economy) - A growing GDP makes people happy there is more wealth to go around. It also lowers unemployment which makes people unhappy.</p><p><strong>Inflation </strong> - Inflation measures how much more things cost as time goes on in %. Its why money is worth less then it used to be and reduces the real GDP making people unhappy.</p><p><strong>Unemployment </strong>- When the GDP  drops people become unemployed and this makes them unhappy it also increases crime eventually.</p><p><strong>Crime - </strong>Reduces growth because damage is being done and money must be spent to stop it. Also makes people unhappy.</p><p>To control these aspects the player can increase or decrease \u00a0the interest rate. High interest rates mean low growth and low inflation. Low interest rates result in higher growth and inflation. If interest rates are too low\u00a0 (below 2%) for too long people will take out many loans and this can result in problems like housing market collapses as people and banks go bankrupt.</p><p>The player can also print money which makes it worth less driving up inflation but then invest it in payouts which reduce crime and unemployment or infrastructure which adds a small amount to long term growth.</p><p>Random news events will happen throughout the game which effect the economy.<br/></p>\n<p>It is not a large game but please let me know what you think, if you would like to see more events or features I will see about adding them and try to keep expanding on the game if there is interest.</p>\n<p>Thanks I hope you enjoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:58:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/780c16049719c50b30cb0b0419a4bc39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CodeTo@d"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
