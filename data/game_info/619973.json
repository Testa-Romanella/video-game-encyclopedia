The first descendant of the tribe elders, Breeze, sets out to seek for help from the capital, as well as to reclaim the stolen land for her brethren. The girl\u00a0meets\u00a0Russell Von Hiems, an ex-vigilante, drunkard, and one of the settlers who had come to the west to mine gold. The two agree to jump on a carriage back to Wellchapel, one thousand miles away, as both of them shared not only the desire to get there, but the grit necessary to face the dangers that lie on the road ahead...</p>\n<p><em>This game is a REMAKE of my first jam game called The Long Road, made for Ludum Dare 42.</em></p>\n<p>In The Road To Wellchapel,\u00a0 you play as a group of itinerants, travelling to the capital on a carriage full of treasure. Your job is to protect the treasure and the crew, and make sure both of them reach the destination. You will be faced with difficult choices to make, as you must choose who to trust and who to ditch, who gets to live and who gets to die, in a long and hideous voyage across the continent.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS\u00a0 &amp;\u00a0 RULES</p>\n<p>Mouse click for everything</p>\n<p>Click on characters to select them, then click on a slot in their inventory and then on an item to assign said item to that slot. If the item doesn't go, it's because it doesn't belong there.</p>\n<p>In combat, select a character to act, and then an item, and lastly, which target to use it on. If a character drops below 0 hp, they die. Healers can carry curative solutions, and guards can carry shields and protect allies, taking the hits instead.</p>\n<p>Characters during the journey will have to feed. They do this automatically if there is food on the cargo. If not, they will slowly starve to death. You can also feed them manually.</p>\n<p>TRAITS</p>\n<p>Characters sometimes have special traits attached. They have different effects:</p>\n<ul><li>Alcoholic - will get hungover if not in the presence of alcoholic drinks.</li><li>Insomniac - will not get benefits from sleeping.</li><li>Vegan - will not eat meat, and will get sick if fed by force.</li><li>Horny - will not get sleeping benefits if they don't sleep with someone\u00a0of the opposite sex.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:54:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41e/41e056467c1d210f46452c479f850710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mateus"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
