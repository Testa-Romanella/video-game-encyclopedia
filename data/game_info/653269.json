{"id": 653269, "slug": "void-urge", "name": "Void Urge", "name_original": "Void Urge", "description": "<p>Void Urge is a virtual reality game about the feeling of longing for something not achievable.\u00a0 How often are we not satisfied with our surroundings, our projects or ourselves, yearning after something better, more interesting, more beautiful? This feeling often\u00a0 lefts us with a void, where you feel disconnected from the space itself. These thoughts can be overwhelming, overloading your thoughts, making your brain run out of space. These feelings can also make us wish for a personal void, out of space and time, with no distractions, no tasks, no interruptions. Just a dimension of tranquility for yourself.<br/><br/>In Void Urge you control the unnamed character, endlessly running forward, trying to get somewhere, some other space. Your VR controllers are a tunnel out of space, working as portals, teleporting the character and their momentum. You'll travel through various landscapes in a quest to find some place, some space, where you'd be at peace. The landscapes can be deceiving though, with every passing second shrinking the usable space, making failing and getting thrown back to where you started more and more plausible. You are running out of space, and time.<br/></p>\n<p>Void Urge was made in one week for the Epic Games Jam 2021 by Kalle Rasinkangas. The theme is also relevant to the making of the game, since I quit making it for two days feeling unsatisfied about the idea and myself.\u00a0 All the textures are hand painted and scanned. Void Urge uses Unreal Engine 5 preview version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T06:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2af/2afa94d2eb2aaf88dce38f21557ad185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KalleRasinkangas"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
