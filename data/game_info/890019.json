Your goal is to race to the end by using a mysterious floating orb to freeze the terrain and give yourself a quick path to the campfire waiting to warm you. However, take too long, and that orb will grow enough to\u00a0freeze the entire screen, taking you with it!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD can be used to run and jump, as well as slide in order to pick up speed and duck under certain obstacles!</p>\n<p>The orb can be piloted with the mouse, and use left click to activate its freezing effect! Be careful not to keep it to close to yourself though, or you might risk freezing your own body!</p>\n<p>If you get stuck or mess up, just hit R to give it another go!</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Liam Healey - Systems Engineer</p>\n<p>Bobby Perry - Systems Engineer</p>\n<p><strong>Art</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Kara Howard - Background/Art Lead/ Concepts</p>\n<p>Taylor Penrod - Character + Orb Art/Animations\u00a0</p>\n<p>Donovan Delats - Stage Elements/Campfire Art</p>\n<p><strong>Sound</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Mabel Reed - Music + SFX Design</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Griffin Girvan-Morris - Producer/Design</p>\n<p>Liam Healey - Design</p>\n<p>Bobby Perry -\u00a0Design/Level Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T04:40:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95ea8ae6bd52290bf045e5ed8de4fa81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["w2reach"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
