You need to time your escape carefully.</p>\n<p>Once you've secured your earnings you can upgrade your tools to mine faster and survive longer.</p>\n<p>As time progresses the difficulty increase, but the loot gets better too!!</p>\n\n<p>BACKGROUND:</p>\n<p>This game was made in 72hr for the Ludum Dare 49 Game\u00a0Jam.
