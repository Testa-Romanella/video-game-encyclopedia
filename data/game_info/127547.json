Use a radar to find your way to the target, and a pistol to take them out, but be warned, you only have one shot! If you miss your target and hit a wall, you will instantly fail. Additionally, the targets will fight back, so try your best to understand the randomly chosen rooms around you and to not be ambushed.</p><p>You can see what some of the rooms look like by using the following link, but knowing might ruin the experience. Try figuring it out yourself first, and if you really can't recognise room patterns or simply don't want to try then have a peek. <br/>(Apologies, but the link is currently dead.
