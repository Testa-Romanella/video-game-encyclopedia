The rest of the time was spent banging my head against a blank piece of paper, revenge procrastinating to show this jam who's, uhm... stupid aaaand two absolutely miserable prototypes not worth further mentions.</p>\n<p>So yeah, it's a little rough around the edges. Give it a try anyway!<br/></p>\r\n\u2630 How To Play\r\n<p>The game can be played with a <strong>mouse</strong> - or <strong>touch</strong>, if you're on mobile.</p>\n<p>The <strong>goal</strong> is to score as many points as possible by joining blocks of the same color together.<br/>You loose, if one block reaches the bottom of the screen though!<br/></p>\n<p>Once the game starts, colored blocks will fall down from the top. Click on any colored block to select it. Then click on another block of the same color to join them together. Depending on which block you selected first, the outcome will differ:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Lower block first</strong> buys you time, but won't increase your score</li><li><strong>Higher block first</strong> adds the value of both blocks together</li></ul>\n<p>Once a block reaches a <strong>value of 5 or higher</strong>, it will disappear and it's value is added to your overall score (in the upper right corner).</p>\u2630 Known Issues\r\n<ul><li>If you loose while already having selected one of the two blocks, the game will crash as soon as you click your first block in the next game.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:11:13", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Njamster"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
