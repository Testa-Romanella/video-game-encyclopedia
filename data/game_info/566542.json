Artificial fluids built up inside your ears begin to retreat as the cryoplasm drains slowly.  Breathing comes naturally, at first. And then the tickle of a hundred nanites filtering your oxygen forces a cough or two of surprise.  Beneath new skin, a fresh infusion of blood pulses with the cadence of tribal drums.  Your thoughts cascade and it all makes sense again.  You open your eyes to the dull interior of a starship. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Apsis Online is a minimalist multi-user roguelike (MUR) presented as a series of both multiplayer and single-player \"sequences\".  Set in a dark science\u00ad-fiction universe, you play the role of a voyager. A human, mentally and physically augmented for a new life in deep space. Your mission is to carve out a place for humanity among the stars. A largely hostile environment. Build outposts with resources found at the farthest reaches of the frontier itself. Survive, create new economies from scratch, capitalize and recruit others to join you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Weak governments and social upheaval has ushered in an age of dystopianism. A world in which monopolistic corporations make the rules. Having normalized space travel with advancements in genetic engineering and propulsion, humanity set out to champion the frontier in hopes of discovering a new purpose. Meet new people from within the speckled void.  Enjoy the imaginative flexibility of a true multi-color text user interface.  It will run on almost anything!  Only a keyboard and some duct tape are required to play.  <br/><br/><h3>platform &amp; aesthetics</h3><br/>@Space (pronounced RogueSpace) is a simple take on social networking. Built for speed and security by geeks for geeks who have a love for the command-line.  Rendered in a sharp multi-colored ASCII style for the purist in all of us.
