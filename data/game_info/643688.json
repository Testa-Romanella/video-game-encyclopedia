The default (you don't carry anything), the warmer (you carry the cat) and the darker or colder (you carry the fruit). Solve the puzzle and help the cat to find its place.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is a prototype of puzzle game I made in Bitsy! It has many bitsy rooms since you must update the grid of objects once you grab an object, so it cost a lot of time. Making the game bigger was something I wanted to do, unfortunately, it requires a lot of effort, so I decided to deliver this short game. I hope you enjoy this little piece of puzzle game :) !\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Please report any bug or non-logical sequence of the rooms in the comments. Thanks.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T04:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d79/d79c601d47d089cc9fe023035df65ba8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lugars10"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
