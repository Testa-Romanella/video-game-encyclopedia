{"id": 935257, "slug": "bike-mania", "name": "Bike Mania", "name_original": "Bike Mania", "description": "<p>This is a single player game where you cycle around your nice little hometown recruiting others to take their bikes instead of their cars. Recruit as many people as you can before the time has passed. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Help make your hometown a car free and a cleaner place. Cycle anywhere you want to find people to recruit, and when we say anywhere, we mean anywhere. Do not just have fun exploring the town\u2019s different streets. Have fun jumping up on the town\u2019s different rooftops to explore as well. Make cool tricks as you fly from ceiling to ceiling when recruiting upcoming bikers. \r\n  </p>\n<p>The bikers you recruit will follow you wherever you go, even up on the rooftops. Creating a great tail of fellow bikers that grows longer and longer. \r\n  Bike Mania was developed during a two-week period by students at Futuregames. Our game idea was created through our group\u2019s good discussions around the project\u2019s theme \u201cMobility of the future\u201d and the target audience, which is 10\u201312-year-olds.</p>\n<p>We had honest and effective communication within our group, and that is something we all will keep bringing with us in future projects, and something we learned and will never forget from this project was the importance of playtesting and getting feedback from our beloved players.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>OUR TEAM</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game Designers:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Keziah Ferreira- Eliana Parada - Filip Hagstr\u00f6m - Charles Hugo\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Programmers:</strong></p>\n<p>Magnus Andersson - Andreas Lindberg\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Artist:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Robin H\u00e5kansson - Priya Vadani - Fred Sch\u00fctt\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T12:24:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/733/733a6e07e47844ecc9b68b41ab3fa5e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
