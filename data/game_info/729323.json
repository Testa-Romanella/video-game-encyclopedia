The gameplay and level design between the two games is ultimately the same, though the story, sprites, and artwork were completely redone, as well as music. </p>\n<p>Ruka-chan was a fiesty teenage-looking demon girl that was actually over 1000 years old. Her task was to rid the world of demons and monsters that were causing more trouble than she was. Ruka&#39;s boss Enma, the Buddhist deity charged with judging the souls of the dead - an Asian St. Peter, as it were - is represented as a giant red oni in a business suit and jokingly referred to by Ruka as &quot;Elvis&quot;. One night his body was stolen by a handsome boy known only as, well, &quot;Body&quot; to be used for nefarious purposes along with his army of monsters. Left with only his head, Enma scolds and demands Ruka to get his body back or else he&#39;ll gladly take hers as a replacement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-29T09:03:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fef/fef72be6331f2e7617755991e3520f8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Sting", "Sting Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Taito", "Kadokawa Shoten"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
