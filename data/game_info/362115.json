Then at the end when you've spawned in the whole level you will be able to see the whole thing and how large it is even though it's still only one level. This isn't to apparent in the game however as there are only a few different parts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:40:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d17/d175d30fd1174edc7019d10f352e94bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas Grace"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
