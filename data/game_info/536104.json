The core game is very hard, so thee is a warning. Alongside this, there is a two player minigame mode, to complete small challenges the fastest. (In Development)\u00a0If you can beat my speedrun time of 4:12 min in the single player mode, then good for you.</p>\n<p>This is my very first game that I've ever made, and was made with almost no prior experience apart from YouTube tutorials. As\u00a0a result, I only want to improve from here. All of the assets in the game were made by me, from the bad models, to the awful music.\u00a0Feel free to comment things I should work on, and ridicule me if you want anything added, or if I should expand the game.\u00a0Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:51:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a3d51234420b70d7e7bd712b3f8f0bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HavokRocket"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
