It tells the story of an old character in the universe, Adrian Shephard. My idea for this project came from my favourite company, Valve. And now, when the original Half-Life is 20 years old, I would like to celebrate this with releasing a demo for the\u00a0 game. There will be two versions of the demo, normal and extended. The extended version will have 5 additional levels, but will be given to a few people, since it is meant do so. Teasers are yet to come. The demo is a demo for the beta of the game so there are a lot of features missing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>TO INSTALL: (way01)<br/></p>\n<p>GO TO C:/PROGRAM FILES(X86)/STEAM/STEAMAPPS/SOURCEMODS and rename the Opposing Force 2 folder to of2. Restart STEAM and it should be in library. You <strong>MUST</strong> INSTALL Source SDK Base 2006 &amp; 2007 from Steam for free in order to play. If you have enough space (not necessary to install) you can install All Source SDK Bases from 2006 to 2013 SP.<br/></p>\n<p>IF NOT: (way02)<br/></p>\n<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> INSTALL Source SDK Base 2006 &amp; 2007 from Steam for free in order to play. If you have enough space (not necessary to install) you can install All Source SDK Bases from 2006 to 2013 SP.<br/>Locate Half-Life 2 Episode Two (where you installed it) for example E:/Half-Life 2 Episode Two/ and extract the Opposing Force 2 Folder there. Then rename it to of2. After that right click on hl2.exe and create shortcut. Right click the shortcut and hit properties. Then in target it should look something like this:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Target:\u00a0\"E:\\Half-Life 2 Episode Two\\hl2.exe\". Then write -game of2 after hl2.exe . Here is how it should look:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"E:\\Half-Life 2 Episode Two\\hl2.exe\" -game of2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Keep in mind that the space after hl2.exe\" is required or else it won't work.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Enjoy!</p>\n<p>\u00a0See you when I see ya'.</p>\n<p>-Maverc Team</p>\n<p>-NightPlayTV</p>\n<p>-Opposing Force 2 Team</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T08:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/718/7180612b6d4fa0b079e775b433bd570f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NightPlayTV"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
