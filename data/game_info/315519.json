If he doesn\u2019t realize what he needs to do he will fail and pay the \u201cultimate price\u201d. I have been dealing with a lot of unresolved trauma and this is my way of expelling myself of that. I hope you enjoy the game and good luck finding the good ending and passing the test.<br/><br/></p><p>This was made using GB Studio, an excellent piece of software that allows you to make actual Gameboy games. The track you may hear during the title screen was done in Milky Tracker and it was my first song in the software. If you can\u2019t hear it in-game check out the song in the video. The graphics I used were from the Dungeon Crawl asset by Steven Collings.</p>--Controls--<br/>Up - Up Arrow / W \u00a0<br/>Down - Down Arrow / S \u00a0<br/>Left - Left Arrow / A \u00a0<br/>Right - Right Arrow / D \u00a0<br/>A - Alt / Z / J \u00a0<br/>B - Ctrl / K / X \u00a0<br/>Start - Enter \u00a0<br/>Select - Shift\u00a0\n<p>--Credits--<br/>Development &amp; Audio: Kukareru (me)<br/>Made using GB Studio by Chris Maltby<br/>Special thanks to hardware issues</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T10:41:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/560c5da36c90aa5c9ccd38a48c0ff941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kukareru"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
