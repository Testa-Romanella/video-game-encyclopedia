{"id": 935697, "slug": "banksters", "name": "Banksters", "name_original": "Banksters", "description": "<strong>BANKSTERS<br/><br/></strong>\n<strong>Banksters</strong> is the first Trading game on Web3, a\u00a0 Play&amp;Earn PvP (Player versus Player) game where players, using NFT avatars, compete with each other in Crypto Investment runs. Winners of the investment runs get real tokens as a Prize, which can be exchanged or used in the game to improve all-round gaming experience. <br/><br/>To win an investment run, players must correctly predict price movements for a number of coins and strategically apply the abilities of their NFT Bankster to influence the results of each Investment round (there are five rounds in one investment run). There is also an in-game mining mechanic that forms a core part of the game economics.<br/><br/><em>Playable here:<br/></em>1) Website<br/>2) Beta link<br/>3) IOS: Available soon<br/> 4) Google Play<br/><strong>How to play?<br/></strong><br/>Every Bankster account will be equipped with a mining room where they can mine and earn soft game tokens. Players can also access play modes (\"Invest Run\"), their avatar profile(s), \"Banksters Academy\", \"Wallet\" and \"Leaderboards\".\r\n<p>Each Banskter account will be equipped with a non-NFT avatar called \u201cHamster\u201d, which players can use to play the game for free. The Beta version will consist of testing 3 Avatars : Hamster, Investor, Shark.\u00a0</p><p>All avatars owned by players will be displayed in \"My Team\" section.</p>\n<p>Real NFT avatars are divided into 7 class categories, with each class having sets of abilities the avatar can use to influence the\u00a0gameplay. The higher the class, the better the sets of abilities.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>The actionable gameplay is called \"Invest Run\" where players predict the value of certain cryptocurrencies for a specific duration. Each \"Invest Run\" currently lasts for 5 rounds.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Invest Runs have 3 game modes: Demo, Challenge the market, and Hard Brawl.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Demo:</em> This mode is a free mode where players can test their skills with nothing at stake.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Challenge the Market:</em> This mode currently requires an entry fee in in-game tokens to play, which can be mined from the in-game miner.\u00a0The winner of the\u00a0Invest Run in this mode receives the prize pool gathered from the entry fee in BARS token - an exchangeable in-game token used throughout the Banksters ecosystem.\u00a0<br/><br/><em>Hard Brawl:</em>\u00a0Similar mode to Challenge the market but players must pay an entry fee in BARS token.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>NB: </strong>In the future\u00a0$BARS tokens can be earned or bought/exchanged with real crypto and is not the same as in-game tokens obtained from the miner.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Coin prediction is divided into 2 direction parameters; LONG &amp; SHORT. Players must select a price direction for any preferred 5 out\u00a0of 10\u00a0available coins.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>At the moment only 3 players may compete in one <em>Challenge the market</em> mode. Players can reduce the lobby waiting time by directly challenging anyone in the Banksters community.</p>\n<p>Enter the <strong><em>/Playgame </em></strong>command on the Banksters community page on Telegram &amp; Discord and specify the Invest Run mode you wish to play.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Points are added or subtracted from each predicted coin depending on the accuracy of prediction. If the initial prediction of a coin was LONG and the asset trends higher in real time during the round, points will be added to that coin relative to the real time price data.</p>\n<p>The price fluctuations are 100% real, since we have a direct Binance APY.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Once the round begins, players must monitor the progress of their coins relative to the opponent\u2019s. They can strategically apply the available abilities of their NFT avatar to add more points and end each round with the most points.\u00a0</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Each Bankster is equipped with certain abilities depending on its class. These abilities can be used to influence real time in-game data to help your chosen coins perform better.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Abilities used on a specific coin will not only affect the user's asset, but also influence other players in the same Invest Run who have selected the same coin.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>To influence the market with any special ability, players must pay the \u201cInfluence\u201d cost for the selected ability.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of abilities:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CZ\u2019s Effect</strong>: This ability boosts the value of the selected coin by 30 points and will last for 3 rounds depending on what round it is used. This implies that the affected coin will have 30 points added to it at the end of each round irrespective of its prediction points. By the end of the Invest Run, the coin will have added 90 points.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Costs 2 Influence points\r\n</em></p>\n<p><strong>Elon\u2019s Tweet</strong>: This ability simulates a real-world scenario where Elon Musk tweets about a coin to pump or dump for a short time, maximizing your results. It adds 60 points at the end of the round to the selected coin. If another player in the same Invest Run has selected the same coin, their coin will also be impacted with -/+60, depending on their trade position relative to yours. E.g, if BTC was predicted LONG and another player predicted SHORT, 60 points will be subtracted from the other player\u2019s position while 60 points will be added to the player who used Elon\u2019s Tweet.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Costs 2 Influence points\r\n</em></p>\n<p><strong>Swap Coin</strong>: This is a basic ability common to all avatars including the Hamster. It allows the player to replace a selected coin with another during an Invest Run. This replacement cannot take place during the current round but will be effected in the next round. Once the Invest Run is at the final (5th) round, this ability will no longer be usable.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Costs 0 Influence points</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Swap Position</strong>: This is a basic ability common to all avatars including the Hamster. It allows the player to change or reverse their initial prediction from LONG to SHORT and Vice versa. This change or reversal cannot take place during the current round but will be effected in the next round. Once the Invest Run is at the final (5th) round, this ability will no longer be usable.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Costs 0 Influence points<br/><br/>\n</em></p>\n<p>At the end of the 5th round, the player with the most points will be placed 1st and win the prize pool for that Invest Run mode.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>In <strong>Banksters Academy</strong> you can mint new Avatar NFTs.\u00a0The \u2018\u2019child\u2019\u2019 will get certain traits from each \"parent\" and form its own skills. The Player can use it in the Invest Runs or directly sell on the future marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>The Banksters game uses a <strong>virtual mining system</strong> to generate in-game tokens. Mining is processed solely on Banksters\u2019 equipment/resources and does not impact the player's gaming device in any way.</p>\n<p>Each Bankster account is equipped with its own mining room and a basic mining rig which they can upgrade.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player must begin the mining process themselves, and every X minutes when a Bankster is mining, in-game tokens are added to the mining pool. The pool has a limited capacity, after which tokens cannot be added further.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Players can collect the accumulated tokens from the pool anytime while the mining process continues and it will be credited to the Banksters\u2019 account.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Players can also upgrade their mining rig by spending tokens on\u00a0selected mining upgrades.\r\n</p>\n<p>Mining has 3 parameters:\r\n</p>\n<p>A) Time \u2013 a period of time after which currency is credited to the pool.<br/>B) Number of tokens<br/>C) Pool capacity</p>\n<p>Parameters B and C, as well as the Banksters\u2019 account capacity, are dependent on the Bankster class and will increase as the player levels up their Bankster Avatar.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Banksters is currently in its Open Beta stage and is hosting an ongoing Leaderboard contest where players can test &amp; enjoy the game and also win rewards. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Seems complicated?
