Just in case you didn\u2019t get it, you will have to collect (in a very kind and gentle way, I'm not lying at all) as many living entities as you can in this very island. But don\u2019t wait too long to visit this beautiful place, the clock is ticking and your life depends on theirs... It is them or you. A gangrene is taking over you and if you don\u2019t feed yourself up with human lives, it will kill you. (Well, I guess that when you\u2019re done with this island you will be killed anyway, but who knows ?)\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can destroy almost everything so have fun (before death) and find every statue, you will discover these people's weird culture. And who are you to judge them ? Since you are terrifying them, you can enjoy your power while\u00a0it lasts !\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since it's an arcade game, there is a score, but it\u2019s hidden (we ran out of coffee), so be the best among your friends !\u00a0</p>\n<p>See you on the world record and become the most terrific disease !</p>\n<p>Key Binds :\u00a0<br/>WASD or ARROWS to move around<br/>Left Click to divide yourself</p>\n<p>Team :<br/>Andoni Iturioz - Dev :\u00a0https://ituriozandoni9.wixsite.com/portfolio<br/>Valentin Denat - Dev :\u00a0https://vdenat31.wixsite.com/portfolio<br/>Aline Archidec - VFX Artist :\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/aaylia<br/>Tom Bonnot - Level Art and 3D Modeling :\u00a0https://tombonnot.github.io/\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/tombonnot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T19:20:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfb/dfb6eef843675d00281774fbea5de85e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Routard", "LeFraisier", "Andoni Iturioz", "Aaylia17"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
