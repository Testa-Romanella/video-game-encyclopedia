The first game I created was Splenectomy, which is a small (puzzle?) platformer, where the goal is to navigate a spleen through the digestive tract and out the other side. It's likely never going to get finished, as I've learned what I can from it for now. Everything is open source, so check it out on GitHub if you're interested: https://github.com/SupernaturalCow/Splenectomy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:49:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f86/f86108c0457483ca5d20eb8f43b5ed8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SupernaturalCow"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
