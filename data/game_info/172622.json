{"id": 172622, "slug": "pew-pew-spaceship", "name": "Pew! Pew! Spaceship!", "name_original": "Pew! Pew! Spaceship!", "description": "<p>Pew Pew Spaceship is a game I made for the Game Boy Jam 5. Your goal is to shoot the asteroids. If you let a asteroid hit you, you will lose some health. There are 2 health bars. The bottom health bar is your health and top health bar represents how much more time you need to wait till you can use the cannon. The rest of the game is self explanatory. If you encounter a bug please tell me by posting a comment. Thanks.</p><p>credits: Art/Sound effects/programing: Me. The art for the button that links you to my twitter was originally made by https://twitter.com/SuperPenguinDef/status/7832907... but I changed it's size and colors.  <br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>A to move left and D to move right.</p><p>Space bar to shoot the cannon.</p><p>Pew Pew Spaceship! V2 is just like the original game but with lots of improvments (This version was made after the jam was completed)</p><p>Change log:</p><p>1. Added some basic music and more sound effects.</p><p>2. Added one power up.</p><p>3. After your score is bigger than 1200 you get double lasers and the game  becomes slightly harder.</p><p>4. I made the game more fast paced in general.</p><p>5. The ship movement is now more precise because the main game now runs at 60  fps.</p><p>6. You can pause the game by pressing ESC.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c1/0c12e06c0e4a3b6f1a4e7eb23d8bc68d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Water Flare"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
