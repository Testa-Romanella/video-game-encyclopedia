Tweeting enemies results in them dying and increasing his ragebar. Everytime the ragebar is filled he gets an orange which he can eat to activate his rage-mode, becoming invincible and increasing his tweetrate.<br/>When he grabs the.... cats that spawn every now and then he regenerates life and thus is able to tweet more.</p>\n<p>This game was part of a gamejam at our school and both developers are educated to become game artists.</p>\n<p>A devlog can be found here:\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=47522#p47522<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/664f170421751050a33e4707fce9897c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["WoodenMan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
