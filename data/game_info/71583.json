Some people say they are as old as the world itself, others think they were made by gods. There is no information about the Pillars of the Creation, but we all know one thing for sure: the destiny of the world is linked to them.<br/><br/>We discovered the truth during the Pillars War. Hundreds of thousands of unknown creatures appeared from nowhere, and attacked the Pillars of Creation. We learnt then that destroying the Pillars would mean the end of the world.<br/><br/>Our legends teach us the stories about brave heroes who stand up to the evil creatures, and defeat them. The legends talk about the Arcane Rings, powerful items the heroes wore, and gave them the strength to battle against their enemies.<br/><br/>Hundreds of years has passed since the heroes defeat the dark army, and the legends have become tales for children. Most of us started to think these legends were just good and entertaining stories, but really far away for what really happened.<br/><br/>However, these stories are about to become true\u2026 The evil creatures have returned... <br/><br/>There is a war coming, but the old heroes are gone, and nobody remembers how to craft Arcane Rings again\u2026<br/><br/>But there is still hope.
