There are two meters representing the power collected from destroying the angel and demon enemies. Spend the meter separately to do massive damage, or clear the screen of bullets. Or, spend both meters simultaneously to enter a special scoring mode that briefly makes you invincible, and turns bullets from a destroyed enemy into more points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first project with the Godot engine to try it out, and made in\u00a0collaboration with\u00a0@TheWallyWiz (Twitter), who made all of the sprites, came up with the concept, and the awesome name.\u00a0</p><p>Please send me your high scores after playing!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n\r\nKeyDescriptionArrow keysMoveZDemon shot.
