Press C or clear to clear the two boxes and fuse again (if it doesn't clear automatically). Press M or the mute button to mute all audio. Press the hint button for an idea on what element you should work on getting next. Collect a total of 53 elements!</p><p>Last Update I added a mute audio button, but you can also mute by pressing M on your keyboard. I also fixed a bug where newer elements added cleared the merge variables AFTER the sound finished playing.
