{"id": 271013, "slug": "my-land", "name": "My Land", "name_original": "My Land", "description": "My Land is a farming simulation game from the maker of My Planet, My Business Empire, and My Colony. You begin the game with a blank plot of land and $5000. From there, it is up to you to make it your own. You can create a farm with crops and animals, or you can create a commerce area with side walks and pizza stands, or you can create a nature park with lakes and trails. The choice is yours!<br/><br/>In My Land, you may take up several avenues of revenue generation.  You can do farming, business, or run a nature trail system.  The farm is where the easiest money is to be made.  There are no real rules to the simulation, so you can basically do anything you want to.  Feel free to explore all that the game has to offer!<br/><br/>I consider My Land to be a game in progress, and as such, I am open to any and all suggestions on how to make it better.  If you guys want it to be more farm oriented, I can add more farm related things.  If you like the business and nature side, I can work on that too.  If you would rather start seeing it move in a different direction, tell me in the comments!  This game is for you guys!<br/><br/>If you are looking for a nice laid back farm sim game and do not want to be bothered with constant in app purchase requirements and financial nags, then try My Land today!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:00:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f83157bfab0f1421d1ac32041df1adc2.jpg", "website": "https://apps.ape-apps.com/my-land/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ape Apps"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Brandon Stecklein"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
