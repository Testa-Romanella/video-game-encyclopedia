The work extracts slivers of the human condition and portrays them in a new visual universe.\u00a0Design characteristics for this project were created to reflect expression of virtues in nature and religion.</p>\n<p>The focus will be on Islamic virtues through their fundamental tactile aesthetics.Structures designed in this environment were designed to allow more space and clear views of the games natural settings.</p>\n\n<p>This sense of freedom helps ease the player into experiencing another couture without any human contact or commitments. The mosque, religions objects and sounds convey the religion in this virtual environment.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The open space allowing the player to feed there owe internal dialog. Throughout the scene low rise mountains, ground level sea and sky peaking at sunset allows viewing the environment from any perceptive.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0This freedom to explore will be reflected in the layout through space, scale and lighting. As this is a first-person player in a non-linear game the objectives are to interact with the objects in a relaxed comfortable setting in no particular order.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Most design elements of the religion itself will be abstract, but a few objects will be created to reflect the traditional significance of this piece.\u00a0 The environment will be set against a backdrop of a water. One sound piece will be played throughout the environment, which will be atmospheric in texture.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Natural lighting will be depicted through glass and the only control in the space will be the parallel walls of the mosque and the water itself which will be set at a mesh collider. This will give the player no choice but to walk forward. Scale and distances will be consistent, featured in high ceilings, wide distance between pillars, positioning of points of interest i.e. objects which are exposed due to the open environment.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c38/c3805651ea30de9b82ffbc6db0bfb93f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Ece Yavuz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
