He moved there with his wife in 2001, leaving our family home in Western Sydney and thus fulfilling a lifelong dream I didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t understand at the time. On the 23rd of August 2015, my Father died of heart failure resulting from advanced emphysema. I was with him in his home when he died.<br/><em><br/>Write What You Know</em> is a memoir of what happened on that day. It is an interactive narrative that attempts to mesh the visceral and banal reality of someone\u2019s passing with the nonsensical noise that can pass through the thoughts of those standing by.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Write What You Know </em>was originally commissioned by Runway for Issue #31, \"West\". <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T07:00:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/221d990a1911c146c9b0263d63b160a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daniel Green"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
