It takes inspiration from the classic game, Fruit Ninja. You must swipe to cut the colorful balls, they give you 1 point and also play a fun sound.</p>\n<p>This game is somewhat music inspired too, there are 5 different beats to play in the background, and 5 sets of unique sounds (each ball having it's own sound).</p>\n<p>You can also customize your swipe color!</p>\n<p>Did you know I make games every single week? You can checkout progression videos for each game, and even how I make them on my youtube channel here:\u00a0One Week Games - YouTube\u00a0you can also follow my instagram to stay up to date with\u00a0all of my games and even vote for the next game I make!
