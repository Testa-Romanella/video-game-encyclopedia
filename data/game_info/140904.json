This game is a combination of playing some sick hand while making sure your cards match the ones present in order to get sick combos and impress your friends. Try not to get too caught up in the music though, you still need to hit the notes at the right time to\u00a0rack up a high combo!</p>\n\n<p>Instructions:<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse Input is the only control<br/>Play the matching shape card\u00a0when the shape is over the red polygon.\u00a0<br/>If you miss playing a card, you lose a strike!\u00a0<br/>Three strikes and the game is over. Try to last until the song is finished to win!<br/>Keep a combo streak going to get back a strike!\u00a0<br/>If you need a new hand, hit the shuffle button, but you will break your combo doing so.</p>\n\n\n<p>IF YOU LIKE THE MUSIC / SOUND ...we didn't make any of it and got all of it from freesound.org. Check out the download called AudioSources.txt for links to all the music :D</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 41 where the theme was:\u00a0 Combine 2 Incompatible Genres. A card game meets rhythm game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67e79242f0c8a08f521492d0b58297f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Drell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
