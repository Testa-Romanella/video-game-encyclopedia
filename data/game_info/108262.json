We are working on Metanoia, a 3D adventure game in which you're going to explore a mystical world looking for celestial artifacts.</p><p>The version you're about to play is in early development, the core mechanics are implemented as well as a basic progression system. We strongly recommend that you use headphones and a xbox controller to have a better experience.</p><p>Use the left stick to orient the character, the right stick to move the camera around it and the right trigger to gain some weight (this will allow you to gain more speed when descending a slope but will also slow you more when ascending one).</p><p>We definitely need your feedbacks to improve this project so feel free to share your impressions.</p><p>Here you'll find the first trailer we made : https://vimeo.com/151891274</p><p>And here is the last one we uploaded : https://vimeo.com/167651036</p><p>You can follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and our DevBlog (links below)</p><p>FB : https://www.facebook.com/MomenteamStudio/</p><p>Twitter : https://twitter.com/Metanoia_Game</p><p>Tumblr : http://metanoia-project.tumblr.com/</p><p>DevBlog : http://projectmomenteam.wix.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51c/51c3068dbc89b6e8cf5ba04b26258edc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Momenteam", "Dukes"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
