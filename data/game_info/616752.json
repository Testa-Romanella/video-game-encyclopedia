{"id": 616752, "slug": "project-warlock-ii", "name": "Project Warlock II", "name_original": "Project Warlock II", "description": "<p>Palmer - a dedicated disciple of Warlock wakes up in his castle&#39;s bedroom. His master nowhere to be found, castle overrun by demons, and only his trusted arsenal as means to stop them and make sense of it all - the young warlock must now collect himself, his guns, recharge the staff and make his way to a nearby stronghold spewing hordes of the hideous monsters.<br />\nProject Warlock II picks up right after the events of the first game, shifting the perspective to that of three disciples of the first game&#39;s Warlock. Each perfecting their own discipline, with his or hers reasons to confront the old master. Utilising everything their mentor taught them, and harnessing the powers of combat magic, pyromancy and dark arts - Palmer, Urd and Kirsten must now put their hard earned skills to the test.<br />\nGet ready for three explosive episodes - each revolving around a different Warlock with their own skills, perks and arsenal, and featuring a distinct setting, menagerie of deadly monsters, requisite boss hulking in the darkness and more secrets, weapon upgrades, pickups and jumping, strafing, and spraying trigger happy action that you can shake a lightning staff at.<br />\nEach of the Warlocks carries a different arsenal based around their personas and playstyles<br />\nTools of destruction can be upgraded through special stations resulting in 20+ weapons for each Warlock<br />\nShotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, quad barrelled harvesters, swords, staffs, cannons - and that&#39;s just Palmer&#39;s toys<br />\nIn Project Warlock magic is only supplementing weapons, or - as some put it - totally useless<br />\nIn Project Warlock II each of the Warlocks has his or hers three cooldown-able skills to use and support gun- or magic-play<br />\nProject Warlock&#39;s monsters defining trait was their relentlessness. That same applies to describe their strategy, Tactics. And - probably - problem solving approach. As the saying goes - when you&#39;re a hammer everything looks like a Warlock trying to pump you full of hot magical lead<br />\nProject Warlock II&#39;s monsters jump, run, hold back when needed, hop, whirl and use each of the different attacks on their disposal to make your life as miserable as only a pigdemon with welded-shut cestuses and spiked back can<br />\nEach world consists of six huge, sprawling levels - size of each roughly 5-10 times bigger than any individual level of Project Warlock<br />\nExpect to spend up to one hour on each of the PWII&#39;s levels, or more to find all the secrets, easter eggs, perks and achievements<br />\nExperience multi-floored structures, platforms and buildings that literally elevate the gameplay from that of the original Project Warlock<br />\nLet&#39;s keep this one short. Project Warlock has no saving whatsoever.<br />\nProject Warlock II has all the saving. Quicksave (F6), Manual Save (choose your slot) and Autosave. There is literally no other save that we could push in there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-10T20:51:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f60/f60f0b216b2a2e2e54d92fb3ec4811e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.57, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 63, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 70, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Buckshot Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Retrovibe"], "esrb_rating": null}
