She is stuck in her room, and the only way to get through it is to paint and create and skillfully get past all the enemies and traps this dream holds.</p>\n<ul><li>Arrows to move\r\n</li><li>Z to create mode, and hold Z to create\r\n<ul><li>Z Up and Down are solid platforms\r\n</li><li>Z Right and Left are slip through platforms\r\n</li></ul></li><li>X to confirm creations</li></ul><p>Current Mechanics:\r\n</p>\n<p>\tThis new game will allow players to build and design the landscape. This will be player versus level, like many classic side scrollers. With strategy players must traverse the level and make it to the end, but the only way to do so is with skill and design.\r\n</p>\n<p>PICO 8:\r\n</p>\n<p>\tI used PICO8 because of Celeste. I played the game and came across their PICO8 prototype. I never knew it was a prototype, and I always assumed it was just a little easter egg of a mini version of the game within the game. The hair changing color in create mode was actually inspired from it. That being said though, it was a lot of work to code and create. I had some help coding player physics from Nerdy Teachers on Youtube. I had to animate sprites, create physics for the world, and create the world. All together it was a tough but fun time.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tI had a lot of fun making it. If I had more time, I would have made it longer, fixed bugs and added more elements. There are some story elements, but they are more behind the scenes. There are two parts of this level, one is standard level, the other is an experimental level, with platforms and builds changing to certain properties. As the player builds here, the builds will change to ice and sand unlike in the first part of the level where it was just a plain platform. This allows for the player to be more strategic, and also play around with the world\u2019s terrain.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T14:10:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/080/0806aeaf0700c09b3c35a29f998f0ea7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arianquader"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
