Keep moving and killing to increase youre adrenaline and do more damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If you find you cant move, its an invisible block (bug)\u00a0just keep jumping. There isnt really a win condition (in theory it would be after leaving the bank (out the front)<br/></p><p>If the guards appear to behave weird it\u2019s because I made a way out scoped state system where the AI would patrol and chase and jump over cover. With that being thrown together on no sleep it ended up being pretty buggy.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Huge thanks\u00a0to my team member\u00a0Daniel for all the amazing art assets and work creating fun mechanics. By the end he had made over 100 sprites and had also made\u00a0\u00a0alot of\u00a0sound\u00a0effects, although due to time many couldn\u2019t be implemented.</p><p>We do plan to continue work on it as we believe it\u2019s a fun concept that would be very enjoyable in a polished form.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T02:44:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d59/d59e2d9f0dca541b24d76928af57d786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jackmaxwell", "Mr. A Creed"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
