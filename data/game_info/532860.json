Everyone is looking to find their perfect match today and it's your job to make it happen. You need to match students with the same colour above their heads together. You can help do this by redirecting students using the icons on the ground which you can rotate to send them in different directions.</p>\n\n<p>Match mania\u00a0was made as a university project in the span of\u00a06 weeks with 2 weeks of that being\u00a0production time. Our limitations were that we had to make a turn-based game about anything to do with any holiday.</p>\n<p><strong>Student Project By:</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Caleb Palmer\u00a0</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Jacob Ryan</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Callum Nottage</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56b/56b4736628f67c4b04c4bea4fe84dbe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Caleb Palmer", "Jacob Ryan", "Callum Nottage"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
