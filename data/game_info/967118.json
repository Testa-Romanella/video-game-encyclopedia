It can be a secret passage, a side quest, or an useful item that may help you later.<br/><br/><h3>Fight peculiar characters!</h3>Chain moves to perform combos! The more you advance in the game, the more moves you will discover. And also, there are no easy fights, so be prepared.<br/><br/><h3>Collect Items to help you in your adventure!</h3>Items play a huge role in this game. They can let you perform moves in battle to achieve higher combos, or break a big rock in your way. Never be afraid to use them.<br/><br/><h3>Meet some quirky oranges!</h3>Throughout your adventure you'll find many characters. Some may help you, some may attack you and some may just want to chat a bit.<br/><br/><br/>And that's it! This is my first game on steam and I'm super excited! So I hope you have a fun time playing it releases later this year :D", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T03:00:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e3/5e303aa642981370ebb72a10144d64da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tomyatemo"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["tomyatemo"], "esrb_rating": null}
