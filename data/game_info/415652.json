Now, when one of them tries to jump, it\u2019s his friend that is launched in the air. They are clearly defective, and there is no choice but to throw them away and leave them to rust in a dumpster. This is when the players will assume control of the characters: In Your Shoes is a platform cooperative videogame in which each player controls one of the robots to lead them out of the dumpster. Players will have to communicate and coordinate jumps, movements and interactions with the environment to navigate levels formed by platforms and obstacles. Sometimes, the only trouble will be trying to get the other player to jump at the right time, but progressing in the game will mean facing new difficulties: timed levels that will self-destruct if not evacuated swiftly, broken pipes that flood the main room\u2026\u00a0all of this while needing to coordinate with the other player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:18:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a41/a4178999ae9096302d49b5be5cc90f0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
