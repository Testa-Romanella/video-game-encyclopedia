Nuclear missiles? Bioweapons? Wars? No. These answers are all wrong. <br/><br/>Why? Because people fight back bravely when they know that they are about to die, which is why they always survive. Therefore, to destroy this planet, you have to find a way that drops their guard and undermines the world secretly. And when people realize the problems they are facing, it will be too late for them to handle or escape.<br/><br/>So what is that best way? Well, this game will provide you with a solid answer.
