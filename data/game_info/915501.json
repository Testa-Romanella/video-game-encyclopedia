The first player to join with the A button is the parasite/hunter/snake (from now on: snake), the second player is the defender.\r\n</p>\n<p>As snake, you want to encapsulate the defender. You grow bigger by destroying the bridges they build. Be careful though, since you can't touch yourselves or the red bridges.<br/>As defender, you want to make a lot of bridges and make sure they stay there for a longer period of time. Your bridges will turn red after some time and become barricades for the snake. Make sure to not move through the snake, since that will kill you.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Movement</strong><br/>Defender: To move from cell to cell, move your thumb stick to the desired cell, and jump with A<br/>Snake: Move with the thumb stick\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T09:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35cb510158f468d3bd9982c634312c00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["redband1t"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
