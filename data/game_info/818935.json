The\u00a0Dice Attack mode and the Dice Tosser mode.\u00a0</p><p>In <strong>Dice Attack</strong> you must prevent a buttload of <strong>randomized, flying dices</strong> from falling on the <strong>ground</strong>. If you fail to do so you will lose<strong> health</strong> and obviously<strong> die</strong>. If you manage to <strong>click</strong> on the dice however you will <strong>gain score</strong> and send those<strong> pesky cubes with dots</strong> straight to <strong>hell</strong>! <strong>How much score you gain per click is randomized</strong>. The theme is Roll of a Dice, after all (; <strong>More dice spawn over time.</strong> I dare you to get a high score higher than <strong>500</strong>\u00a0 ; D</p><p>In <strong>Dice\u00a0Tosser</strong> you can <strong>bet</strong> on a <strong>number from 1 to 6</strong> and if that number <strong>shows</strong> on the dice you win:\u00a0\u00a0<strong>absolutely nothing</strong>. You can also <strong>adjust the strength</strong> with which the <strong>dice gets thrown</strong>.</p><p><strong>Sounds by</strong>: us, dersuperanton, Leszek_Szary, Dieter van der Westen.\u00a0</p><p>Dice Model by:\u00a0 Armor and Rum<br/>Game made by The Horse\u00a0Bros!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:10:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cb/3cb0444bb609b54a57349db89bd19b48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NIkyy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
