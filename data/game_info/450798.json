Give it a try, and let me know your thoughts to contribute to the process and make the final thing that bit better.</strong></p>\n<p><em>You are a dragon in the days of old.\u00a0Fly from level to level and leave destruction and fire in your wake. Eat up villagers, sheep, burn down forests, villages and more.\u00a0Or dont?</em></p>\n<p>Right now, you can:</p>\n<ul><li>Customize a dragon to your liking.</li><li>Eat people and burn down small villages in the mountains.</li><li>Burn down forests and eat sheep.</li><li>Collect gold from destroyed towns to increase your score.</li></ul>\n<p>There are some small problems with the game right now, mainly that it's very easy to break the bounds of the map and people just sometimes stand still. This is a work in progress, so this is to be expected.</p>\n<p>This game will receive 3 updates. This is version 1, and is more of a demo than anything else. Version 2 will have more quality of life stuff like customization and maps. Version 3 will have a conclusion in the game and wrap things up. Let me know what you want to see first, and I'll do what I can.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>P.S. if you can come up with a better title I'll happily use it!
