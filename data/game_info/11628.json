What if it was shining into our eyes every night for the past 4.5 billion years?BantaraThey call themselves the Bantarans for Bantara is the native name of the Moon. Similar to humans, and yet so much different. Bantarans are known to have not one heart like the humans, not even two hearts like the Doctor, but even three hearts functioning perfectly within their bodies. But where are they? And why haven't we ever seen them? There's a catch... The Bantara mother carries the Bantara baby inside of her for about 4000 years... That's how much it takes for those three hearts to become perfectly synchronized. But their lifespan reaches more than 100 000 years. How come? There are absolutely no known bacteria nor viruses on the Moon leaving them with the perfect chance to evolve very fast...1969, human year<br/>Until 1969 - human year. That's when us, humans, had made our big achievement and landed on the Moon's surface. We gloated for a while and then simply gone away leaving behind a neovirus that is not detectable by human technology. That was the end of the life as the Bantarans knew.<br/><br/>Afraid, desperate and almost hopeless, the Bantarans decided to run for their lives... And their target was Earth... They didn't hate, they didn't want revenge, they simply wanted the humans to help them. But they were, as us humans would say, naive.The Landing<br/>As soon as they have landed and made contact, we started protesting against helping the aliens for they might be our enemies. Typically. Human scientists were forced to lock the Bantarans inside laboratories and conduct experiments, but there was one person who has restored the faith in humanity. Dr. Oliver Pendaka declined to commit genocide and released the Bantarans making it possible for them to flee further inside the laboratory. <br/><br/>There still might be hope for the Bantarans from the Moon.
