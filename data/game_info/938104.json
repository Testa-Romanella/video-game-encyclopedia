Do you want to defeat your opponents by sheer superiority? Then train in the Realms and refine your combat skills!<h3>Variety Of Skills </h3><br/>We want to give you the option to fight your battles the way you want. Whether using elements or close combat, ranged combat etc. There are skills for many different areas to create the character you want.<br/><br/>All skills are divided into different skill families. Depending on which DNA modifications you choose, you can equip different amounts of different families. The choice of your playing style is completely up to you!<br/>And Many More Skills Are Still In the Planning!<h3> Crafting</h3><br/>Another option for individualization is crafting your own DNA-Modifications. Genetic enhancements are the shit for more advanced species, so of course you want to take advantage of that too!<h3>Mysterious Realms</h3><br/>Interesting places scattered all over the multiverse, where there is much to discover, fight and loot!<br/><br/>What will you find? And ... who put all this stuff there anyway?<h3> Story</h3><br/>So many places to visit! And who knows. Maybe you're not the first everywhere. Maybe you will find traces and records of old inhabitants or previous visitors that will give you an insight into what happened and bring you closer to the stories and cultures of the places.<h3> Faq</h3><br/>Frequently Asked Questions (at least we think you want this questions to be answered :D)<h3> What Will Happen After Early Access?</h3><br/>After Early Access, the plan is to expand Hyparxis with DLCs.<br/>These DLCs will contain new realms, equipment, skills and much more.<br/>A campaign is also planned, whose chapters will be rolled out step by step with the DLCs.<h3> Why Dungeoncrawler and not Epic Story RPG as previously announced?</h3><br/>The Dungeoncrawler component was always planned. But during development we noticed that this component, together with the maps and quests and everything you need for an epic story, would overload us too much and this would only lead to a decrease in quality. And we don't want that, as Hyparxis is very important to us.<br/><br/>The story will therefore be released in chapters with the DLCs as DLCs.<br/><br/>We focused on the Dungeoncrawler component because we ourselves like to play Dungeoncrawler. The story is wonderful to immerse yourself in a game and feel with the characters, but in the end the endgame, or the development possibilities of the characters, is what ultimately binds us to RPGs over a longer period of time!<br/><br/>And We Hope It's the Same For You :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T06:35:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1d/e1d682222fa8d44b58e01b177ec9b39a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["br41nch1ld"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["br41nch1ld"], "esrb_rating": null}
