In response to that, we thought about what we could do to help. <br/></p>\n<p>We reached out to some acquaintances who are teachers, and talked about educational games available for them to help with teaching. Unfortunately, we found that a lot aren't due to technological or financial limitations, and so we decided to make a game!<br/></p>\n<p>This game as it is now is very simple, and has a limited number of levels. We hope to add more levels over time and adjust the difficulty to better teach about shapes and their relationships. We intend to use the Ontario Government's Grade 1 Math Curriculum as a basis for what information to include.</p>\n<p>This\u00a0game\u00a0is\u00a0offered\u00a0as Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW)\u00a0in\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0make\u00a0it\u00a0available\u00a0to\u00a0those who\u00a0cannot\u00a0afford\u00a0to\u00a0purchase\u00a0educational\u00a0games,\u00a0especially\u00a0in\u00a0these\u00a0times.</p>\n<p>If you are able to donate, and enjoyed the game, we would appreciate any donation amount so we can spend the time to make more levels, and bring the game to other platforms.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, comments, or suggestions , please consider making a post!<br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:05:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/586/586c9fafe540aa8ff05298656ddd1ac5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Atemly Games"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
