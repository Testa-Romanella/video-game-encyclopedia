As the match progresses, players need to continuously obtain new cards to replace and upgrade the cards in their lineup, building a stronger lineup to achieve ultimate victory. It offers rich strategic depth while reducing the complexity of traditional card battle games. <br/>\r\n\u25cf Card Design The game features a wide variety of characters and items. Rich cards not only bring randomness but also support the game's plot; various different cards can be freely combined, allowing players to create unique play styles. In the initial design, we have created five major factions: the Empire of Casnia, the Kingdom of Kortland, the Church of Shias, the Desert Khanate, and the Chaos Tribe, presenting players with hundreds of unique cards and items.<br/>\r\n \u25cf Game Modes The game offers four play modes: Adventure Mode, Story Mode, Mirror Mode, and Confrontation Mode. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdventure Mode uses asynchronous battles, allowing players to start or pause the game at their own pace. <br/>\r\nQuick Mode offers shorter rounds for a more intense battle experience. <br/>\r\nStory Mode allows players to learn about the continent and the stories behind each card during the game. <br/>\r\nMirror Mode records every winning lineup in confrontation mode. Confrontation Mode allows players to engage in real-time game matches online or with friends using LAN.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T09:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74c57375fd269608a7555487de9fa648.jpg", "website": "http://autochess.lvhegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Green River Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Green River Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
