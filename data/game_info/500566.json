(if you're using a French keyboard, you can also use the Q button).</p>\n<p>Oh and don't forget that you can also use the SPACE button to get a little boost in your legs and jump!</p>\n<p>See you explorer.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Developers:</p>\n<ul><li>Marius \"Astroboy\" Van Nieuwenhuyse</li><li>Jason \"Vakeros\" Defer</li></ul>\n<p>Artist:</p>\n<ul><li>Jesse \"Jwoodif\" Jamison Menser</li></ul>\n<p>All the assets are created by Jwoodif.</p>\n<p>All the sound effects and music created by Astroboy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T07:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/183ba386719eb94f2982b00e44577be2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vakeros97", "mariusvnh", "LOHOLLYWOO1f"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
