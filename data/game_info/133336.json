The game focuses heavily on spastic platforming action complete with boss fights, spikes, and plenty of fire. Ted by Dawn follows the story of Ted Carcass, a reclusive survivor of the apocalypse. Ted is a rugged man, a man's man ,a beard supporter, whiskey drinker, shotgun aficionado, and reluctant savior of the human race. <br/><br/>On a routine supply run to the local tavern, Hunter's Haven, Ted runs across a scientist. After an unfortunate skirmish with some fellow redneckians, Ted is left to escort his newly acquainted friend across the wasteland to find a suitable laboratory to synthesize a cure for the horrible mutagen that has ravaged the land. Along the way, Ted will meet with hordes of zombies, mutants, savage survivors, and apparently, flaming pants. <br/><br/>* 15+ hours of gameplay <br/>* 20+ levels <br/>* Boss-battles <br/>* Humorous story <br/>* Retro platforming style <br/>* Brutal difficulty <br/>* Multiple survival modes with option CO-OP <br/>* Score system with achievements <br/>* Full controller support - highly recommended <br/>* 60 FPS depending on GPU quality</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ef/6efec8102d82af020ebbee7f0a634079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProteusPixel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
