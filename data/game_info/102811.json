As a FROG ASSASSIN, you knew any mission could be your last. When you took on the job of killing the Hive Queen in her Honeycomb Fortress, you knew the risks. You didn't know she'd be expecting you. You can't possibly outlast her dragonfly hordes, her wasp armies, or her deadly rat mercenaries. But you can paint the honeycomb walls with their ichor on your way out. At least your tadpoles will be well taken care of, for the minutes before they grow arms and come to avenge you. The family profession will live on.</em></p>\n<p>Frog Assassin is an <strong>anti-rhythm game</strong> of simple combat. Use the arrow keys to move your Frog. Touch your enemies before they touch you to defeat them. Dragonflies move to the drum beat. Wasps move on the half-beats. Rat Mercenaries - well, you watch out for them. <br/></p><p>Cover art by Rian Sygh.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/5661d8634036208529a8b3927861e5da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anna anthropy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
