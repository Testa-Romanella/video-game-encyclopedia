You may have also noticed a fully featured boss battle, an interactive menu, and a high score system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T15:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f6/6f63eae9be8c0fbbda874d451bf73246.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OnePersonStudio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
