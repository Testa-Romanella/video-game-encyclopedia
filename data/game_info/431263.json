I haven\u2019t even written a single line of code in that time, but it was a nice feeling to be back. Surprisingly, the whole development cycle went very smoothly. Scope was exact and achievable in the given timeframe, which was very unusual for me just a few years ago. It also has a narrative, which was impossible to fit in before (a feat of which I am very proud). I will attempt to fix any crashes on launch or game-breaking bugs even after release, but I will leave the original version available at all times. You can see any of the changes made here or on my github in the following weeks. I will also be making a full developer commentary and timelapse of the development, which I will embed here when available. I look forward to hearing what you think of my game.</p>\n<p><strong><em>19 April, 2020 - 23:19</em></strong></p>\n<p>The first wave of feedback was mostly how easy it is to cheese the game by spamming bullets off-screen and killing everything. There is code in place to despawn bullets at a certain range, but it seems that it wasn\u2019t enough. I implore you to try going through the game without spamming the fire button. It makes for a much more enjoyable experience. This will eventually will be fixed in the post-compo version.
