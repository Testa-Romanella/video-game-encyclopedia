The game finishes when all buildings are 3 stories tall \u2014 that is, no further moves are available.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, the starting colour\u00a0is chosen randomly. Every round, each player can make one move. After each player takes their turn, the rules are applied and then the order of turns is switched.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SKYSCRAPERS</strong> is a 2 player competitive strategy board game with a serene atmosphere. It's very much like chess, if chess was Conway's Game of Life played with abstract buildings on a triangular board.</p>\n<p>This is a game made in 48 hours for the <strong>Slavic Game Jam 2019</strong>, the theme of which was \"GROWTH\". Made by me with additional models from Izabela \"Isnea\" Nowakowska. Font used: Josefin Sans by Santiago Orozco.</p>\n<p>Added after the jam: \"AI\", music, height meter + small things and fixes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T10:46:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2e6cb2f28e0b4c6589ce91a5b762837.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Matthias Scherba"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
