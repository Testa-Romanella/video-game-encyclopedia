It allows to create custom shaped cell grids, place objects like units or obstacles on it and play a game with both human and AI players. The framework was designed to allow implementing various gameplay mechanisms easily. Please refer to\u00a0Unity Asset Store\u00a0page for more information.</p>\n<p>The level was inpired by <strong>Heroes of Might and Magic</strong> series. Assets used to create the scene are\u00a0Aekashics Librarium - Librarium Bundle Ultrapack\u00a0and\u00a0Backgrounds by Kronbits</p>\n<p>The level showcases some of the features coming to the<strong>\u00a0new Turn Based Strategy Framework release</strong>. Spells were implemented with help of the\u00a0<strong>Ability System</strong>. Spell targets are calculated flawlessly by the <strong>reworked AI</strong>.\u00a0Turn ends automatically when player unit has no more actions left, another new Ability. Unit selection order is based on their speed, thanks to the new <strong>Turn Resolver</strong>. Finally, a different approach was used in building the scene - it consists of a background with an overlay of semi-transparent tiles, instead of being constructed from individual cells.</p>\n<p>In the game you control\u00a0<strong>elemental creatures</strong>\u00a0and a\u00a0<strong>Hero</strong>. Each turn you can use one of the creatures and\u00a0<strong>cast a spell</strong>\u00a0with the\u00a0Hero unit. There are two spells available: area of effect\u00a0<strong>Fireball\u00a0</strong>that damages all units in given radius and\u00a0<strong>Ligthning</strong>\u00a0spell that jumps between enemy units, dealing progressively less damage.\u00a0The game ends when all enemy creatures are defeated.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:37:29", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["crookedhead"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
