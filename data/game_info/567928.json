{"id": 567928, "slug": "wheres-my-drink", "name": "Where's My Drink?", "name_original": "Where's My Drink?", "description": "<p>The local restaurant, The Salty Seahorse, has started to do pizza deliveries due to the pandemic and Benji decided it was the best thing ever. Shy little Benji doesn't like to leave his home much, but he loves pizza just a little too much to not ever go out to\u00a0 get it. Now he doesn't even have to leave his home, they just bring it to him!<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0It's not long before the delivery has been made, and Benji couldn't be more excited.\u00a0Everything looks great, until he felt a bit parched. No drink!? Where was his Diet Doctor Kelp!?</p>\n<p>Something seems a little fishy, and it's not just Benji.</p>\n<p>He doesn't like confrontation, but he thought he should give the Salty Seahorse a call. It was a bit rude of them to not give him his drink, don't they know anything about customer service! It took a lot of courage, but he picked up the phone and made the call.</p>\n<p>However, it seems things were not in Benji's favor, and to\u00a0make things worse, the manager, Mr. Grabs, won\u2019t give us back our money, or the drink! It was time for Benji\u00a0to take matters into his own hands\u2026</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Welcome to\u00a0<em><strong>Where's My Drink?</strong></em>\u00a0\u00a0A simple little \"Hallway-with-Guard\" game about a fish who simply just wants to get his drink so he can eat his pizza properly.\u00a0 (1000% not based off of a joke from a certain show, I promise)</p>\n<p>Play as <strong>Benji</strong>, a\u00a0shy little guy tired of being taken for granted. He\u2019s bubbly, he\u2019s a crybaby, but he\u2019s got his mind set on <strong>getting that</strong> <strong>drink!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>But watch out! The manager knows when Benji is around.\u00a0<strong>Mr. Grabs</strong> is greedy money-grubbing lobster, not to be confused with a certain cousin! He\u2019s mean, always looking to bully poor Benji, but can also literally be <strong>blind to the </strong><strong>money</strong>!</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The game features a first-person point of view that offers a detailed look at the environment.   </li><li>The level features two distinct restaurants to travel to and from with a guard and obstacles hoping to stop you from reaching your goal.\r\n  </li><li>As a puzzle platformer, the player can interact with different aspects of the environment to get past the guard and reach the goal.
