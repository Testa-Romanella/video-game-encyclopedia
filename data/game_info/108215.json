Malevolent deities from different myths manage their own piece of Hell in an eternal dispute of power. Taking the role of a rookie god, the player will join them in a cutthroat competition for becoming the new Boss.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs a city-building game, it focuses on the creation, management and improvement of our industrial facility. However, gameplay is shorter and slightly faster paced than usual, emphasising the tension and rivalry of the competition. In addition, events, sabotages and some other situations will occur constantly, forcing us to think fast and make difficult choices on the spot.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Personal contribution</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Coding</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Basic management systems for tiles and map resources.</li>\n<li>Transformations handling for both logic and physics entities.</li>\n<li>Manager and initial hierarchy of events <strong>+</strong> Lua-C++ integration (Luabind) for events creation and launch from Lua scripts.</li>\n<li>Managers' configuration parameters reading from file.</li>\n<li><em>Souls trial</em> logic: souls creation, categories and roles.</li>\n<li>Buildings priority system and automatic workers assignation algorithm.</li>\n<li>Graphics programming: camera, illumination, materials and shaders.</li><li>Some minor GUI and audio related stuff.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Project</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Repository management (GitHub).</li>\n<li>Project compilation and building process (Ant) <strong>+</strong> New libraries inclusion (Lua, FMOD).</li>\n<li>Team management and coordination (developers, designers, artists and musicians) <strong>+</strong> Email and social networks <strong>+</strong> Most milestones presentations.</li>\n<li>Original game concept.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b7/4b7e3db7a3bb9fefb6bb77e46473d86c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ra\u00fal Segura"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
