The engine should be mostly complete but there's a long way to add enough content to complete the initial goal.</p>\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Source Code</li><li>Devlog</li><li>Online demo (unstable)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T09:08:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62c/62cab902db1cbb7579598e5f2916faa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Slashie"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
