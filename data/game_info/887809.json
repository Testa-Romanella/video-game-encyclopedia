In this game, you are a piece of cloth, made with a lot of little hooks, and like Midas transforms everything into gold, HookGUY sticks everywhere, and in every people\u2026 particularly in FluffiePEOPLE's: the CottonLAND population, and the core of the game challenges. With peculiar mechanics, you need to dodge the NPCs that make \"mobile mazes\", that you can't touch, or they'll stick on you. If it happens your mobility goes to zero, the game goes to the game over, and you need to restart from the last checkpoint. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The narrative is awesome too: on a typical day, HookGUY was going to his work at the LP store and, on the other side of the CottonLAND, he saw LoopGIRL, his sweet love.<br/>But COTTO, a very big, bad, and jealous piece of cotton kidnaps her.<br/>And now, you have to help me to rescue my love from the hands of evil!<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T05:58:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/858/858dc9ce4f87bf733254d0b2c690854e.jpg", "website": "https://fuckingelectric.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fkn electric studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["fkn electric studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
