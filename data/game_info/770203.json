It takes inspiration from old school black and white gangster films to recreate an environment reminiscent of 1920's and 1930's New York City. Players will have to travel through the levels of the game in order to escape capture, with the end goal being to escape from the mob's hideout and bring the story of crime and corruption to the public, and dismantle the mob from the inside out. The game involves simple run and jump mechanics to allow players simple and straight forward movement through the levels as they attempt to reach the end goal, and beat the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T10:39:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b39/b39b182af26a45e53af2e1199b922224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patar63", "GeoSalsa", "Lizical", "IKODI008", "MelFortin", "TallMills288"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
