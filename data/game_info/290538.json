I am a computer science student and have a hectic schedule so my free time is limited. This is my first attempt at publishing a game I have built. My goal is that I will make enough money from this game and other games I plan to make that I can quit my job in fast food. Donating to this game helps me, a broke college student, do the things I love. I will continue to work on this game until I feel it is a complete and cohesive experience. I have shown this game to my friends and family and I absolutely love it when they enjoy what I have created. I hope anyone who downloads this game also enjoys it! The more feedback I receive the more inspired I feel to work on my project so please tell me what you think. While this game is in development I will keep it free with optional donations. Once it is finished I will set a minimum price. I also plan to release this game on mobile if I make enough money to buy the licensing I need to do so.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc9b51c18382c25f95985015f99c473.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LandOfHamGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
