{"id": 437185, "slug": "cabin-tales-haunted-hunting", "name": "Cabin Tales: Haunted Hunting", "name_original": "Cabin Tales: Haunted Hunting", "description": "<p>A submission for the Haunted Hunting Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Player beware, you're in for a scare! Play across two terrifying stories, each revolved around the theme of the hunt. Both are guaranteed to give you nightmares!</p>\n<p>Hunt is the a story of an invisible killer that is never seen. All you can hear is the rustle in the grass, if you're close enough. A game not focused on jump-scares but on a creepy atmosphere, Hunt is perfect for your average hater of jump-scares.</p>\n<p>Once you've survived (or died to!) the invisible killer from Hunt, try Trapped for a good scare. Equipped with only a flashlight and an uneasy stomach, avoid the oldest living member of the Smith Dynasty as Hunting Season #129 is commencing - and the Smiths didn't hunt animals. They hunt humans. And did I mention every dead member of the Smith family is possessing your foe? That might come in handy to know.</p>\n<p>This game harnesses the power of horror and creates a horrid game that will make you regret ever playing. You have no control over what happens - only the game chooses your fate.</p>\n<p>This game has full Oculus support! Play it on your Rift or Quest with Oculus Link!</p>\n<p>Mature Audiences only - Rated M17+\u00a0 for mild language, intense violence, and blood and gore.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T02:49:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c4eddcd0e9ca5f1183dd858d4f97159.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GlitchGamingKingsley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
