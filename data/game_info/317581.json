For instance\u00a0 SAWTSOA1OB simulates the concept of studying abroad and puts travel at the fingertips of anyone with 12 megabytes of rams . The player will have to learn to traverse the plains of Machu Picchu, solve the jumping puzzle laid millennia ago by ancient pharaohs. You will embody the spirit of adventure (which is red) to survey the land in order to make sure its safe for all the college juniors looking to \u201cbroaden their horizons\u201d by their trip. In order to do that the red spirit will need to die repeatedly in what will be surely a valiant effort to a score a paycheck from concerned parents.</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Cartoon Airplane by Viz Games</p>\n<p>Wood texture by Yuji Nagata</p>\n<p>Cobblestone texture by</p>\n<p>George Panayiotou<br/></p><p>Sandstone texture by George Panayiotou</p>\n<p>Japanese food texture by: Sev_4</p>\n<p>All images courtesy of Unsplash.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:32:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dd/9dd6136e025227531f77f737a040f358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["johnpfrommer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
