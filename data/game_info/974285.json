This is a project I've been working on for a few months based on the original Slenderman game (The Eight Pages)<br/>\r\nBuilt in UE5, It Mimics is a classic indie horror game exploring a moderate-sized map to collect eight different pages. Players will constantly be followed by a monster who never loses the player's trail. This requires players to time when they go into a certain area to retrieve each page. <br/>\r\nThe game comes with three modes to play to provide some replayability if the player chooses. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNight Mode - Night mode is the default and suggested game mode for the player. The entire game was designed around this game mode.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDaytime mode - For those who want a brighter, yet still creepy experience, daytime provides the player with some beautiful sunshine. However, morning fog will do its best to block what light it can still. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nChallenge Mode - Based on the night mode, challenge mode spawns multiple monsters for the player to juggle and evade as they collect the pages. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you enjoy short indie horror games that are a bit of a walking/running experience, without the loud jumpscares, then I'm sure you're in for a treat.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T06:13:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ced/cedd96ed0972f7acf5697be67ad8b615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Postal Knight Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Postal Knight Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
