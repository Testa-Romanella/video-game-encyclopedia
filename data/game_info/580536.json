{"id": 580536, "slug": "snake-2021", "name": "Snake 2021", "name_original": "Snake 2021", "description": "<p>Inspired by classics like 'Nibbler', 'Snake' and 'Snake Byte', 'Snake 2021' is a frantic puzzle game to guide a growing snake to apples and avoid collisions.</p>\n<p>Starting as a single point, the snake grows with each apple it consumes. It must avoid reaching either the edge of the grid, or biting itself. Rapidly turning left and right, or up and down, will also anger the snake.</p>\n<p>The game is endless, but fraught with danger: every second is a heart-stopping battle for survival.</p>\n<p>'Snake 2021' has a 'modern' phone backdrop, snakeskin textures, a delicious-looking apple and rousing soundtrack - but it's a 70s arcade game at heart. Fun, free and maddeningly addictive.</p>\n<p>Design and programming: Jo Weber\r\n</p>\n<p>Additional programming: Anas Callejon</p>\n<p>Tutorial: Niclas Gleesborg</p>\n<p>Music: JDB Artist</p>\n<p>Simple Input System: Yasirkula</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T07:25:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bf/8bf9629fafe797d63b3105ef1176c394.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["expeditiongames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
