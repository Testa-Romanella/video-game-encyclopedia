{"id": 91833, "slug": "who-we-are-now-demo", "name": "Who We Are Now (Demo)", "name_original": "Who We Are Now (Demo)", "description": "<p><em>Who We Are Now </em>is a queer, post-apocalyptic visual novel set ten years after a nuclear war scoured the earth. It follows Wes, a young man who, drowning in the memories of everyone he's lost, returns to a settlement called Home in search of something to ease his pain.<br/></p>\n<p>The demo explores the very beginning of the game, allowing you to meet Elder Mohra, who runs the town of Home, as well as two of the main love interests, Jesse and Xander. You'll get to begin to understand some of the problems they are dealing with and see how Wes might be able to fit into their lives.<br/></p>\n<p>Our Kickstarter ended successfully on April 15th, and the game is now in full development. The first part of the game, Xander's Story, was released on December 10th. If you are interested in preordering the game and getting access to Xander's Story, you can do that here.<br/></p>\n<p>This demo is a collaboration between myself (Bryce Duzan), as well as Allison Paige, who created all of the art. You can find Bryce on Twitter at @Spincut and Allison on Twitter at @Rabbitcourage or on Tumblr here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff9/ff9f1cb8f3a83f81182f70d3ed90afea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Spincut"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
