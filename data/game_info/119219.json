I created this game, as well as the sprite art, music and sound effects on my own for the experience and the pleasure of creating something weird. </p><p>Since this is my first game, I hope you can forgive the less than perfect experience and presentation. Even so, I would love to hear any and all feedback so I can continue to improve. Also, to reward you for reading this far into the page: enter \"halloween\" at any point in game to enter godmode (this will wipe your score and lock you out of the secret ending, but I dunno, it might be a little fun).</p><p>Thank you again, I hope you enjoy Glitch Witch.<br/><br/><br/>Hit me up on Twitter - https://twitter.com/clineiodine</p><p>Or Tumblr - http://clineiodine.tumblr.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d3addfe7c1d2ef6319b4bfb2322fb51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cline Iodine"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
