Forensics are still investigating what happened but we still don't have any credible information. No victims were injured, nor do they have a history of chronic illness. It's like they're in a deep sleep, but they can't wake up. The possibility of murder and suicide has already been ruled out, since no traces were found, in addition to the victims being found in several different locations.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Now, you have to stay awake as long as you can.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>move with\u00a0<strong>W, A, S, D</strong></li><li>interact with <strong>E</strong></li><li>rotate with <strong>MOUSE</strong></li></ul>\r\nTeam\r\n<ul><li>gabriela milet</li><li>patricia milet</li><li>lucas koerich</li><li>brenda rocha</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T10:07:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df9/df9d964411ad1dc58b2f184d48b35a4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["triciamilet", "Gabriela Matias"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
