Every hit you take from hostile spacecrafts disturbs your control-panel which you have to painstakingly fix to - <em>delay the inevitable</em> - prevent loss of controls.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The button mapping is not only variable, but has to be remapped by you during gameplay.<br/><br/>Remapping is done by mouse input. Just drag from one side of the control-panel to the other to create a cable.<br/>Mapping one key to multiple actions is possible (trust us - you will probably need that at some point).<br/><br/>Remove a cable by dragging the same way you would to create it.<br/><br/>Available keys are <strong>W</strong>, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, <strong>Space</strong>, and <strong>Right Mouse Button</strong>.<br/><br/>Available actions are <strong>Up</strong>, <strong>Down</strong>, <strong>Left</strong>, <strong>Right</strong>, <strong>Shoot\u00a0</strong>and <strong>Dash\u00a0</strong>(you are invincible while dashing).<br/><br/>The initial button mappings are <strong>W </strong>for <strong>Up</strong>, <strong>S </strong>for <strong>Down</strong>, and <strong>Space </strong>for <strong>Dash</strong>. Not ideal - so get on remapping immediately! Oh and by the way - your right mouse button-panel does not look so good...<br/><br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p><strong>SPOILERS AHEAD</strong>\u00a0if you like to figure stuff out on your own<br/><br/>You lose by - well - losing all your possible button mappings. So try to survive as long as possible to get the highest score!<br/><br/>Key-panels have three states. So they are either totally fine, probably ok or definitely broken. Every time a panel gets damaged a little bit more it loses all its mappings, but as long as it is not completely broken you can remap it without problems.<br/><br/>The hostile ship types are:</p>\n<ul><li>A red ship shooting bullets which damage a random key-panel</li><li>A blue ship shooting a freeze ray which makes removal of button mappings impossible for a few seconds (so keep your mappings clean even under pressure)</li><li> A spiral bomb exploding into an emp wave removing all your button mappings without damaging your key-panels (try to destroy it before it destroys your precious mappings!)</li></ul>\n<p>Sometimes destroyed hostile ships drop items:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>A small heal which repairs a random damaged key-panel partially</li><li>A full heal which repairs all key-panels fully</li><li>A bomb that destroys everything on screen (except your ship - if we can trust our spaghetti code)</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The crude graphics are made by us (thanks to the power of Inkscape).<br/><br/>We used pixi.js to drive our code and graphics-capabilities.<br/><br/>All sounds are from pixabay:</p>\n<ul><li>Shot-Sound: shoot02.wav by V-ktor</li><li> Explosion-Sound: Musket Explosion by Willlewis</li><li> Freezeray-Sound: Old camera flash by MichelleGrobler</li><li> EMP-Sound: Synth Bass Drop Impact by AlexLane</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T23:00:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/662/6626be596366d8dabad5759630edd036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Crygos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
