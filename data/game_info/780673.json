Flow.\r\n<p><strong>Infinity Girl is a high-speed rhythm/roguelike</strong> <strong>where everything \u2014 every action, every enemy and every world you encounter \u2014 is driven by the beat of the music. </strong>Each run is unique, with procedural levels that test your skills as you grind, drift, boost and leap to the rhythm.\u00a0Get into a flow and blast through levels at incredible speeds, gaining game-changing abilities along the way.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note: this is a pre-alpha demo!</strong> You'll have a good time (but expect a few bugs). Lots of polish, optimizations, sound effects, new enemies/obstacles, abilities,\u00a0levels and so much more are in the works.\u00a0I'm releasing this to get early feedback from the community as I work towards a proper alpha version.\u00a0This demo has five levels, all procedurally generated so each run is unique. The final game will have around 16 levels in each run across multiple different worlds, with a roguelite permanent progression system, procedural music\u00a0and a mind-bending story that reveals itself over many runs.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nDemo instructions: Please read\u00a0before you play!\r\n<ul><li>A controller is required (for now)\u00a0</li><li>First time playing? Do\u00a0the tutorial first!\u00a0</li><li>Press start to see the controls and instructions.\r\n</li><li>You have to boost, brake, bank (L &amp; R) and jump on beat -- the dots at the bottom of your screen can help you visualize the rhythm.\r\n</li><li>Once you have a trail behind you, you're in a streak. Once you're in a streak, try to hold and release B on beat to use your brake blast! During a streak, you can also use special abilities (mega boost and the kangaroo jump) which you can upgrade between levels as you.\r\n</li><li>Select will reset your position to the last checkpoint. The final \"boss\" level has no checkpoints ;-)</li><li>As you collect coins over multiple runs, you'll eventually earn more permanent starting lives!</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nLike the demo?\u00a0Wishlist the game on Steam here!\r\nLet us know what you think!
