Creatura is a virtual aquarium/terrarium tank to manage and simulate evolution from the very ground up. Every plant and animal inside takes part in natural and artificial selection, creating unlimited possibilities in simulating or recreating unique environments and pets, while being scientifically accurate with up-to-date biology research and helping to understand Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel great discoveries with easy to understand and captivating gameplay.At The Beginning, There Was (Mostly) Water.With empty vivarium tank at hand, start your journey to create thriving biomes using only time and artificial/natural selection mechanisms. Begin with single cyanobacteria to rush the botanical travel through algae, ferns, vines, grasses up to modern flowers and fruit trees, just by strategically taking plant cuttings, the same method agriculture used for last ten thousands of years. Every plant shape, colour and type is possibility, just wait for desired mutation to appear, take a clipping and plant it to create new and unique flora species. <br/><br/>Then, Wild Fish Appeared. While some multicellular organisms thrive using only sun for photosynthesis, other quickly evolve ability to cannibalize living entities for energy.
