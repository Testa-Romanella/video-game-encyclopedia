I no longer have easy access to the code for this project however it is (semi) functional so I figured i'd upload it anyway (also I needed to for a uni assignmet)</p>\n<p>Gameplay is simple, you continue going till you die. There is no score system, a bunch of debug stuff is still active and the game isn't very well optimised but it is playable.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Up Arrow:\u00a0Up /\u00a0Move selection up(menu only)</p>\n<p>Down Arrow: Down / Move selection down (menu only)</p>\n<p>Left Arrow: Slow Down</p>\n<p>Right Arrow: Speed Up</p>\n<p>Enter: Activate Selection (menu)</p>\n\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>Move your character, hitting black squares and small squares while avoiding everything else. A large wall of death is coming up behind you so don't stop moving.</p>\n\n<p>As has been said, the game was never finished and is unlikely to ever been finished but here it is.</p>\n<p>The instructions and options buttons on the menu do not work.</p>\n<p>The only way to exit the game is to close the console that opens with it.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy :)</p>\n\n<p>P.S. If you guys actually like this game I will remake it so that it is functional and works better.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Menu Music from:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/conten...</p>\n<p>Game Music from: https://opengameart.org/conten...</p>\n<p>Font: http://www.dafont.com/neuropol...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/805de659142cede3dfc3d333d3c4150b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Connor Hasson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
