The aim is to reach the highest tiles and the highest score.<br/><br/>Just drag colorful blocks into the desired locations and enjoy watching your numbers fuse and grow higher.<br/><br/>It definitely is a casual game but in every move, you must think ahead. Remember, every action you take has its unique consequences!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>* Drag the next tile in queue to the desired place on board and place it.<br/><br/>* When same valued tiles touch each other, they are combined and you get the next higher number on the position of the last placement. (Horizontal, vertical, diagonal\u2026 All kinds of contact does the job!)<br/><br/>* You can just combine two numbers or play strategically and get chain combos to get higher scores and to clear the board as much as possible.<br/><br/>* The ultimate goal is to reach the highest tile value. However you must be careful so the board does not fill up. Once the board is full with no possible fuse, the game is over!<br/><br/>Fused Features:<br/><br/>- Addicting &amp; Endless Gameplay<br/>- Easy to play, hard to master<br/>- Cool block colors and adaptive background<br/>- Sounds that help relaxing and focusing<br/>- Share your scores and dare your friends to beat your score<br/>- Leaderboards that lets you compete with everyone (Yes, just like Gary Oldman states in L\u00e8on: \u201cEVERYONE!\u201d.<br/><br/><br/>Oak Games Inc.<br/>Contact support@oak.gs", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-02T20:26:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a55/a55c57fa18a4043aab63b4d78cd93cf3.jpg", "website": "https://unicostudio.co/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Unico Studio", "Oak Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["UNICO STUDIO"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
