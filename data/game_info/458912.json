The goal of the game is gaining as many points as possible by killing enemies, or connecting to them with your hook/cable to suck out their energy with the risk of not being able to move while doing so.<br/></p>\n<p>You use this <strong>grappling hook</strong> to maneuver around the arena which allows you to pull youself towards safety, or grip walls before bouncing off of them in order to dodge the robotic enemies that will keep charging at you until you stop them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another hazard that will make the game hard for you are the spike blocks that fly across the arena in random intervals. The longer you play, the more you'll have to move around to get a good high score.</p>\n<p>This game is a sequel to Gravitational Focus, a game I made exactly one year ago, and is a submission to the<strong> ScoreSpace x Alakajam 2020</strong>, made in <strong>72 hours</strong>. It uses\u00a0Daniel Linssen's m6x11 font in combination with the NYX8 color palette and is fully mobile and touch compatible.<br/></p>\r\nHave fun!
