You're on a special mission. You will be deployed at coordinates 39.83093, -77.2311! We have a major problem, these... ghost-like THINGS have been invading on our military bases. We need a brave warrior like you to kill them off.. The problem is, they keep comin! But before you go in, I need to tell you some information we picked up from our observers back at base. First off, these ghosts come in at all angles, so be prepared. Second, if you touch any of these ghosts, your ship will instantly die. We haven't figured out the technology behind how to prevent that just yet. Next, a boss ghost will appear every 60 seconds, so keep your eye on the timer we have set for you in the bottom left of your screen. Last, I\u00a0hear there is a special easter egg, when you pause the game, that helps kill off the ghost easier. Try to get the most ghosts you can, and report your score back to base when your finished. Well, good luck soldier. Your truly a hero...\u00a0 Now, Go Get Those Ghosts!!!<br/></p><p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the Arrow Keys to move</p><p>\u00a0Left Click to shoot\u00a0</p><p>Move Mouse to aim\u00a0</p><p>Press P\u00a0to Pause\u00a0</p><p>Press P to Unpause\u00a0</p><p>Press the Spacebar to reset the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa2/fa2a20abe35d5dc6e065bd826084635b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["34115"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
