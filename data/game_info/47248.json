Scattered worlds were claimed on the fringe of the galaxy. Each pocket of survivors held on to an isolated set of worlds while trying to rebuild under the great law of Shalun. Three centuries later, technology has brought them back together again. Discovery of the hyperwarp has bridged what was once an unimaginable distance between far-flung colonies, long-lost families, and political factions.  <br/><br/>With that reunification has come great economic prosperity. The hyperwarp reestablished the transportation of cargo, goods, and technologies between the quadrants \u2013 but it has also brought great strife. Political rivalries have been rekindled, blood has been shed in age-old feuds, and the fires of war have been stoked. Amidst the political infighting, a ruthless revolution is rising \u2013 and the fervent explorers of the hyperwarp have awoken something that was better left asleep.<br/><br/><br/>Our very first game, Star Traders RPG, took hundreds of thousands of gamers on an interstellar adventure. Star Traders\u2019 success and overwhelmingly positive reception helped to launch Trese Brothers Games. It was the adventures of our community\u2019s star-crossed captains that put us on a trajectory to share more of our worlds, ideas, and dreams.<br/><br/>We set out to capture the loneliness, bravery, and camaraderie of people living together in a spaceship sailing across the stars. It is with great pride that after releasing four other games in the Star Traders universe, we\u2019ve created a sequel to the original Star Traders RPG. <br/><br/>Step onto the bridge of your starship, take to the stars, and create your own story in Star Traders: Frontiers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-09T17:45:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cc/2cc4b28acc09b8024859f6ef6594cd35.jpg", "website": "http://www.tresebrothers.com", "rating": 3.6, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 135, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 7, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 420, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC", "iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Trese Brothers"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Trese Brothers"], "esrb_rating": null}
