{"id": 101268, "slug": "blood-rushers", "name": "Blood Rushers", "name_original": "Blood Rushers", "description": "Game-Analysis:\r\n<p>Blood Rushers is a 4 Player Arena competition in which the participants must kill each other in order to win. The combat is fast-paced and encourages the player to wisely evaluate when to strike and dodge. By a \u201cDynamic Boost System\u201c the interaction OUTSIDE the game(socializing) becomes a major part INSIDE the game.</p>\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n<p>Please not that this was a diploma school-project produced by 5 classmates of HTL-Spengergasse and we only had about 6 months producing it.</p>\r\nSide-Information:\r\n<p>- The game is playable with 2-4 players, but I highly recommend playing with 4. This is the number tailored for the perfect experience.</p>\n<p>- Furthermore the only control-device supported is the PS-4 Controller.</p>\n<p>- There also might be some bugs. One currently known is an \"animation-stuck\" bug related with the Mayan-Character and the daggers. There's a temporarily fix for it, which resets it after a second.</p>\r\nReversed &amp; Play Austria 1.5:\r\n<p>Blood Rushers was also shown both on the BigIndieFest@Reversed (http://www.reversed.at/) and the Play Austria 1.5 (https://playaustria.com/play-austria-1-5/). Here are some pictures of the days :)!</p>\n\r\nPlay Austria 1.5\r\n\r\nReversed\r\n\r\nReversed\r\n\r\nAudio-Recordings:\r\n<p>Nearly all sound-effects in the game are recorded by us. We spent a whole day in a professional recording-studio of HTL-Spengergasse and had a lot of fun. Here's are small glimpse into this day ;) :\u00a0</p>\n\r\nThe Dev Team:\r\n<p>The dev-team consisted of 5 class-colleagues of HTL-Spengergasse who developed the game as their diploma-project for their final school year.
