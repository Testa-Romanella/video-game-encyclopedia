{"id": 683962, "slug": "axion-scion", "name": "Axion Scion", "name_original": "Axion Scion", "description": "<p>Welcome to Axion. You are the benevolent despot of this system, looking to retire to a nice tropical paradise planet ASAP. Fortunately your Scion just came of age, and if you can keep them alive for 9 years, you may be able to enact a peaceful transfer of power. Remember the goal, no heads need roll.</p>\r\n\r\nTurn Order\r\n<p><strong>1. The Event Card</strong>: Each turn of the game represents one year in Axion. The turn starts with  an event card. Event cards can have direct effects on each strata, or  give perks to the despot. Once the event is dismissed 5 cards are dealt to the pot.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>2. Selecting Cards: </strong>The player always has first dibs. You may have up to 4 cards in their had at a time. Once you've selected your cards click the bright pink \"Select\" button. Each strata then has the chance to draw a card. The order they will draw cards and play cards is based on their power (fist).<br/></p>\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe Event stage ends and 5 cards are dealt to the pot\r\n<p><strong>3. Playing: </strong>The player and each strata have the opportunity to play one card per turn. Note that counter cards cannot be played during the playing step.</p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nPlaying cards can effect the Power and Contentment of a strata\r\n<p><strong>3 Countering: </strong>After each card is played the player or remaining strata may each play one counter card. Counter cards have a percent chance of success.</p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nCounter cards that have effects you don't like. Like, those resulting in your death!\r\n<p><strong>4 Resolving: </strong>Once the player and strata have had the opportunity to play their counter cards the outcome of the played card will be resolved. Each counter card will be determined to be successful or not. If any counter card is successful the played card does not take effect. If all counter cards fail and the Played card passes its own roll then its effects are applied. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>5. Turn End: </strong>Once the player and each strata have had a chance to play there cards the turn will end. The strata discard any cards remaining in their hands. If the player and scion are still alive the next turn begins. <br/></p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nBe wary of any card with a knife!\r\n\r\nThe Strata\r\n<p>There are three strata in Axion. The proletariat, the oligarchs, and  the military. You will need to balance the power of each of these  factions to ensure you are not overthrown, and that your Scion is not  disposed of. <br/></p>\r\n\r\nStats\r\n<p>Each strata has three main stats:\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1. Power: </strong>The relative power of the strata. A powerful strata will be dangerous if it's unhappy.\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>2. Contentment: </strong>A measure of happiness for the strata. Be careful if this value dips below 50</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3. Chance: </strong>A multiplier for any rolls made,\u00a0  including counters and interventions. By default the multiplier is 1. If  your Scion is being hosted by the strata it's chance multiplier will be  set to 1.5.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nWin / Loss Conditions\r\n<p>If a faction becomes discontent and have enough power, special \"intervention\" cards will be put into the deck. These cards could bring an early end to your career or foil your sweet retirement plans for good. If either you or your Scion dies, the game ends in a loss. If you manage to make it to the end of turn 9 with your head still attached and your Scion still skipping, you can enjoy your victory on a tropical paradise world of your choice.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nAttribution\r\n<ul><li>Game Code - Alexander Griffith (GPL3+)<br/>\n</li><li>Music - Alexander Griffith (CCBY 4) </li><li>Font - Source Code Pro - OFL </li><li>Font - Edge Of The Galaxy - </li><li>OFL\u00a0Icons - Noun Project (CCBY 4) </li><li>Sounds Effects -\u00a0 NeadSimic (CCBY 3/4) </li><li>Library (Lume,Flux) - RXI (MIT/X11) </li><li>Engine (L\u00d6VE) - L\u00d6VE Dev Team (Zlib) </li><li>Fennel - Calvin Rose (MIT/X11) </li><li>Web Support (Love.js) Davidobot</li></ul>\n<p><strong>This was a submission to the 2021 Lisp Fall Game Jam</strong> </p>\n<p>The source code can be found at:\u00a0https://gitlab.com/alexjgriffith/axion-scion\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T06:47:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2cc9acfada7e34ebc957da92fce3f1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Griffith"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
