These are meant to be non-canon one shots based on a variety of prompts, and are generally aimed towards romantic situations with the four romance options of the original game,\u00a0with some back story drabbles as well. As more one-shots are completed, this hub will be updated.</p>\n<p><strong>Warnings:</strong> The Nameless is currently 16+, and will contain depictions of violence and light gore, strong language, and eventually optional 18+ sexual content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There may be some drabbles that have content meant for 18+ audiences, which will have an additional check to confirm that you are 18+. This is done via honesty policy, so <strong>PLEASE DO NOT PROCEED TO THOSE ONE SHOTS </strong>if you are under 18.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for your support, and hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>~Parker Lyn</p><p>Background Image: Unsplash (Pawel Nolbert)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:28:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/418/4181b4a943349ea26da832510048ddfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Parker Lyn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
