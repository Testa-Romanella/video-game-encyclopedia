They were helped by their friends, their molls, their families, and corrupt police officers. Now find out whether they can get away from you!<br/> <br/>The police get a call: the mob bosses have arrived at a particular house for a meeting. A police squad speeds to the address given. But, while the police were on their way, the houses changed places, or maybe somebody just got confused. So, which house is the culprit hiding in? If you\u2019ve been paying attention, you\u2019ll find him. Identify the house, and \u2013 congratulations: the criminals are behind bars. Not for long, though. Money talks. Now they are on the loose again. <br/> <br/>The mob bosses get harder to find each time. They are very resourceful, and they never hide in the same place twice. They can disguise themselves, blend in with groups of friends, make a getaway in an expensive car, or take refuge in another country.<br/> <br/>And their teams aren\u2019t wasting any time, either. Just blink, and they\u2019ll be all over the place, trying to cover the tracks and interfering with the investigation. But you were on your guard and saw everything, didn\u2019t you? Or did you blink?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:13:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d3ca1310f02783a90a94ca24064fe9a_wyIRQ8C.jpg", "website": "http://www.saturnanimation.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Saturn Animation Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Saturn Animation Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
