The player wakes up one morning and realizes his family is gone. The player then walks downstairs, and notices tracks that are leading back towards the woods. The player then sets out towards the wooded area to see if they can find their family. The player then has to go through several different levels completing the levels to find their family. What the player does not realize is that his family has been keeping a secret from him for a while. The player actually has secret powers but doesn\u2019t know how to control them yet. The player can only use these powers whenever he collects a magical item. After the player collects a certain amount of magical items, they will then be able to use their abilities without the magical items. The ultimate goal is to control the powers and to save the players family.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Play Summary: </strong>\u00a0The player goes through the course like this. As they enter a level, they are then challenged with getting across the level. They are faced with monsters and other terrain dangers. Throughout the levels the player will have a magic staff that can be used to attack the monsters. Later on I plan to add where you have to collect the weapons to be able to use them.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:05:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bf/0bfed699ab897266d90c76c17d3a67d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ayewolfey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
