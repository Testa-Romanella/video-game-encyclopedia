But! you can still use the normal ship if you want. Don't forget using the nicer weapons will ALSO come at a price. Though the enemy team luckily has some change to spare for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use your money wisely to finish the mission and hopefully make a decent profit.</p>\n<p>This game was made by our team, Team Panic, as part of Global Game\u00a0Jam 2022.
