Escape enemies.\u00a0 Avoid detection.\r\n\r\nIn\u00a0<em>Evasion,</em> you must avoid detection by the Laser Gates and Sentries. The Proximity Sensor will help guide you through your journey. To take down a Laser Gate, you must activate its corresponding Remote.\u00a0\r\nBut be careful- if you are too close or caught in the sightline of the Sentries, an alarm will sound and you will be escorted to the beginning of the level! The Laser Gates will also sound the alarm if you run into them.\r\nYou can continue to the next level by exiting through the green Vent. Use\u00a0stealthy and agility to overcome each difficult challenge. Can you complete each level?\r\n\r\nYou can also select Advanced mode, which removes your Proximity Sensor. You can even try the 3-Life Challenge, which gives you only 3 lives to complete all of the levels! Can you do it?
