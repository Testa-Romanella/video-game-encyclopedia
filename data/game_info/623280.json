If the dream stops then all the people of this world, created in this dream will die. To save the world you must never wake up the dreamer. You must somehow cancel the dawn.\r\n</p>\n<p>One of the features of the game is the illusory blocks. They are visible, but not tangible and no longer random. They reflect light ( and do not cast a shadow).</p>\n<p>May be released on mobile and other platforms in the future.</p>\n<p>Creators:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Gracio001 -</strong> programming, level design</li><li><strong>Axel_k (a. k. a.\u00a0sasha) -</strong> programming, level design, graphics<br/></li><li><strong>BRESS -</strong> programming, graphics<br/></li></ul>\n<p>Our forum: http://gamemaker.ucoz.com/forum/50-861-1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T07:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39e7a73baa0e2118ae572406fdc7b397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axel_k"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
