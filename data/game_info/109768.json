Instead, it is a straight forward\u00a0 dungeon dive through 12 levels to get feedback on the combat system. Many of the graphical elements are not final and have issues.\u00a0 Many of the items lack final icons and have defaults.\u00a0The\u00a0game currently has only a small amount of placeholder sound.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The build will be updated constantly. Any feedback appreciated!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Build updated with fixes to\u00a0V0.785</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa9/aa9b4695e3239b7c1cc33612a8667367.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 456, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixel Comrades"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
