You are THEE, random wizard. You have the power to see the future regarding luck and randomness. \u00a0You can see the outcomes of all random events before they happen.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours for the GMTK 2022 game jam.</p>\n<p>I developed this game by myself completely over the jam period.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Go easy on me I really ran out of time.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tutorial</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong>\u00a0In\u00a0each\u00a0level, your\u00a0goal\u00a0is\u00a0to kill\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fail:</strong> A level is failed when the player dies or if all dice are used up.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The dice</strong>: The dice on top of the screen shows how random event will occur. When a random event is triggered the leftmost dice is used.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> WASD or Up Down Left Right</p>\n<p><strong>Space:</strong> Pressing space allows you to roll your dice. Rolling the dice removes the first dice roll in the queue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entities:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>General: </strong>At any point, you can hover your mouse over an entity to see what it does.</p>\n<p><strong>Crossbow:</strong> The crossbow sits and waits. When something walks in front of it, it triggers a random event. This event uses the first dice roll. If the dice roll is a 1 it will jam and not fire. Otherwise, it will fire killing any living thing in front of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Teleporter:\u00a0</strong>The teleporter teleports any other entity that steps on it. The teleporter also triggers a random event. The teleporter will teleport the entity (dice number) of spaces. If the entity teleports into anything other than empty space it dies.</p>\n<p><strong>Crate: </strong>The crate can be pushed by the player. It will move (dice number) of moves when the player pushes it.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemy:</strong> The enemy will charge at the player if the player enters the line of sight. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T13:41:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/151/151079d24eeb1942842ae4c82925f9f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BossManta"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
