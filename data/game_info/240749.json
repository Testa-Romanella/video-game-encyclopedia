Your own demise is the only guarantee here, thus you can only hope to survive just a little longer than last time. But hey, at least you'll have fun doing it!</p>\n<p>Employ a combination of speed, relentless streams of bullets, and the occasional power up, in order to make it to the top of your personal leaderboards in this fast paced, fun, and addicting game!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Note:\u00a0Leaderboards are entirely local to your device. Online leaderboards may be added in future.</em></p>\n<p>And, if you want a real challenge (or find the later waves to be a little too much), you can go into the\u00a0<em>custom game\u00a0</em>options, and tweak certain values, such as enemy move speeds and health. This allows for plenty of fun and unique challenges, as well as a way to tweak difficulty to fit\u00a0<em>your\u00a0</em>preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>Mouse Position -\u00a0 Aiming</li><li>Left Click - Shoot</li></ul></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><ul><li>Programming, Art, Animation - Thomas Robson</li><li>Music - Maximilian\u00a0Ansell</li><li>Sound Effects - Public Domain</li></ul></ul>\n\n<p>Also: as a game development student, any and all feedback is appreciated, and will be used to improve the game in future! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/898/8985f1baddad30e1787222e4dcb66a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TomRobson"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
