The concept of the game is to be\u00a0relaxing, so no heavy\u00a0thought is\u00a0required to play.\u00a0 The player-controlled-object, the background, and all the shape's colors can be chosen, and customized from a near-infinite archive\u00a0of colors. The speed and size of the player-controlled-object can also be customized.\u00a0The only controls in the game are WASD or the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that this is a very experimental build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e96/e96988aa75403bbebad6e60cb6b6d2a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["StormFlame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
