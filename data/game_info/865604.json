{"id": 865604, "slug": "waste-villain", "name": "Waste Villain", "name_original": "Waste Villain", "description": "<p>\"Waste Villain\" is a game that channels your evil side to learn about the World Cleanup Day and what big corporations do to avoid responsibility for the waste and pollution they cause. Instead of fighting the pollution, the goal is to use the strategies that were employed since the 1960s: diverting attention and leveraging your lobbyists to influence law-making in favour of your company. </p>\n<p>Based on idle game mechanics, the player places factories that produce money and parts. The parts are used to build new factories and upgrade existing ones. The money can be spent on marketing and ad campaigns that remove protests or used for lobbyists, who then prevent laws from being passed that would shut down your factories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developed by:</strong><br/>Tess Kissmann<br/>Ekaterina Serkova<br/>Marlo Nickol</p>\n<p>in context of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences \"Creative Media &amp; Game Technologies\" programme.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T09:57:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b29b0676720d9f7825d0438bd0bbdbe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Nynzal"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
