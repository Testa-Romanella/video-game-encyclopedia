The player is able to allocate points from a pool of energy (\"gun juice\") into the stats of the weapon during combat. The one-gun, along with above-average character mobility, allows the player to feel out their capabilities and then explore playstyle choices at their own pace through a variety of distinct enemy and level designs. The player is made to feel powerful, but not invincible, and is required to make effective use of their weapon based on the situation to avoid death.<br/></p><p>Made during the Champlain College Study Abroad Program in Montreal, Canada of Spring 2016</p><p><strong>Producer:</strong></p><p>Ben Powell Francis (@BendyVT)</p><p><strong>Designers: </strong></p><p>Brennan Segarra (@BrenJeebus, www.brennansegarra.com)</p><p>David Durmazolu</p><p>Luca Hibbard-Curto (@PurpleMFTW, www.lucahibbardcurto.com)</p><p><strong>Artists: </strong></p><p><em>Enemy Design and Animations:</em></p><p>Aaron Higgins (https://www.artstation.com/artist/aaronhiggins)</p><p><em>Environmental Art:</em></p><p>Brian Hahn</p><p><strong>Programmers: </strong></p><p>Gill Popson (@HOTSGames)</p><p>Dimitri Kazanecki</p><p>Nicholas Fiegel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04d/04d0ae2ff61a4c51fae0382aa95340ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamOneGun"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
