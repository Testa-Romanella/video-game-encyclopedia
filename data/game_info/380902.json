The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food caf\u00e9, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District.<br />\nEver wondered what it&#39;s like to be Satan&#39;s son? Nothing special... Unleashed lust, chronic alcoholism and reckless shooting - the usual routine. Save Hell! Wait... What? Yup, that&#39;s right - Hell! It&#39;s not the place it used to be - Hell&#39;s been possessed. Possessed by the most vile dark hideous evil the world has known - people. They&#39;ve turned your precious homeland into a madhouse, and only you can stop them! What&#39;s in it for you? Spectacular locations, battles with epic bosses and a nice mixture of pain and nonsense.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-23T23:54:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fec/fec8098f8abf31370f688472e828a701.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 144, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 10}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 178, "ratings_count": 17, "suggestions_count": 481, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Big Way Games", "Big Way"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Way"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
