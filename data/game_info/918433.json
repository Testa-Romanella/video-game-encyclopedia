I experimented with a few basic parameters with multiple moving parts. The goal I set was to have all the interactions end a the same bucket within a few seconds of each other without everything happening all at once and it feeling\u00a0overwhelming.\u00a0After rewatching the final product I thought of a stack of balls toppling once you take one from the bottom - hence the short description. I hope you find it as satisfying as I did.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T10:11:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8c/a8c629d255bc7a6bacb098440e574067.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kora"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
