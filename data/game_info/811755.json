You need to defend your base against the evil geometric shapes with style. Only the rhythm can stop them. Give them a geometric break!</p>\r\nCaution\r\n\r\n<p>Geo Break has colors with high contrast and many visual effects. Please check the screenshots and GIF provided on the sidebar to see if you are okay with playing it.</p>\r\nSummary\r\n\r\n<p>There are 12 levels in Geo Break in which you defend your base against the evil geometric shapes by targeting and shooting them. The shooting is done automatically following the rhythm, and you do the targeting.</p>\n<p>Before every beat of the song, you can <strong>pick one of your geometric-shaped base's sides\u00a0</strong>by shifting between the edges. When the beat comes, you release a bullet in that direction.</p>\n<p>Every two levels, your base's shape gets more complicated, so you should be quicker to destroy the approaching enemies.</p>\n<p>Evil geometric shapes attack more frequently and their speed increase as you progress.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n<p><em>Keep in mind that keys work in every keyboard layout as long as their place on the keyboard is the same.
