Those levers rotate or move other cubes. <br/></p>\n<p>In order to win you must reach the green door which is initially blocked. To reach that door, you must activate levers and avoid deadly traps. Some levers might block you in, leaving you only one option, respawning by dying...\r\n  </p>\n<p>\r\n Developed by Oscar Valay\u00e9, for Wowie Jam 3, with the theme of \u201cFailure is progress\u201d.
