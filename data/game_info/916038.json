But would you be able to survive the hardness of evolution if it would speed up just a little? Would you still be the same as before..?\r\n</p>\n<p>WARNING! A lot of features are -not- in game. As you might guess, I\u00a0just ran out of time XD\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>\"LMB\" to attack\r\n</p>\n<p>\"RMB\" to move\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Add to favourites\" to open way to my heart\r\n</p>\n<p>You can move on any of nearby tiles if you have enough speed\u00a0(it can be increased by certain limbs)\r\n</p>\n<p>You can also move at more tiles than one using the automatic pathfinding\u00a0(but it's buggy, so I do not recommend it)\r\n</p>\n<p>Also I\u00a0messed up the enemy pathfinding system so... Be prepared to run away from angry jellyfish and swim away from murderous ants! I don't recomment to run though, they all might have some cool loot for you~\r\n</p>\n<p>Destroy nests, kill enemies, grow limbs and survive for more turns to get higher score!\r\n</p>\n<p>Tileset taken from: Mountain tiles -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/2d-lost-garden-zelda-style-tiles-resized-to-32x3...\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Water tiles -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/16x16-minimalistic-rpg-spritessome-tiles\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Ground tiles -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/rpg-tiles-cobble-stone-paths-town-objects\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>Slider icons:\u00a0Mine\r\n</p>\n<p>Slider backgrounds:\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/2418769-abstract-red-background\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/old-black-background-grunge-texture-dark-wall...\r\n</p>\n<p>https://wallpaperaccess.com/brown#google_vignette\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/abstract-yellow-comic-zoom_6481665.htm#query...\r\n</p>\n<p>...and there were a\u00a0lot of other links to authors\u00a0that I've lost\u00a0because I forgot to save it all.
