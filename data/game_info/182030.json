Made for this month's #1GAM, this game basically has a 'party' or 'competitive multiplayer' focus. The premise involves one or more players seeing how long they can last against chasing rockets. Each player colour has their own rocket designated to chasing them, and while that is main concern, the rockets from other players have the potential to destroy you as well. By the time most of the map has been destroyed, it becomes a matter of finding a hiding spot, or exploiting your friends' location.</p><p>4 Players:<br/>Controls for the players are rebindable, you can set them to what ever you want. </p><p>Level Selection<br/>There are 4 levels, each selected from the level select screen which involves a the four images in separate sectors of the screen. </p><p>Side Note:<br/>I'm not an artist, so please excuse my bad drawing. But I do hope you enjoy the game and hopefully have some fun with others :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e1d8e37432ace59c198a3064c3942ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
