{"id": 271544, "slug": "turn-undead", "name": "Turn Undead", "name_original": "Turn Undead", "description": "<p>Turn Undead is a turn-based RPG with a twist; After your party fails to defeat the final boss, the mage is killed and then brought back to life to work for them. The rest of the game consists of you fighting and killing your old party as boss fights, and then recruiting them back to your side via necromancy. Between the boss fights you encounter peasants and guards who are trying to protect their town and, ultimately, the king who recruited you in the first place.</p>\n<p>Customize your party through leveling up and unlocking new, more powerful abilities, and find new equipment in the 5\u00a0levels the game has. Features 5 boss fights and random encounters.</p>\n<p>Created by a team of 8 students from AIE for major production.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>For combat, simply click the portrait for the character you wish to control, and then select a target to attack before clicking a move. Do this for all party members and then click the continue arrow to lock in your moves and see the combat phase. Clicking the portrait of a character you already set will remove their current move, so you'll need to redo their attack before proceeding.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f6/0f62e68625c56e312ffb7470e429428b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Georgia-Shepherd"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
