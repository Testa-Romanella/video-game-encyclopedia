I made it for two reasons. First, I had some nostalgia of the Korea of the past and wanted to create something that reminded me of it. Second, I wanted to make an entire project inside an SVG file because it seems like a futile exercise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In both cases I succeeded. Before anyone criticizes the weird typography and layout of this machine, you should look at the originals. I was as faithful as I possibly could be to their shoddy workmanship.</p>\n<p>Regarding making the entire file inside an SVG, itch.io requires an index.html file, so I\u00a0added that, but if you download the actual code, this entire game can be run by loading the SVG in the browser, including the sounds. Futile, yes, but I\u00a0enjoyed making it.</p>\n<p>NOTE 2:\u00a0There is no save feature or leaderboard or anything because I\u00a0don't really think it is that type of a game. If someone really wants to implement saves, I will think about it, but I\u00a0don't want to have a leaderboard because it will ruin the self-contained nature of the product.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T14:25:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47a/47aef37666c819d5737b6e24f61ab2a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["petenotpete"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
