You&#39;ve been chosen from our list of applicants to play-test our new game (which as of now does not have a title).<br />\nNot only that, tech department said they made a breakthrough with a new device (they won&#39;t clue me in but I hope it&#39;s big). Apparently they&#39;re going to &#39;play-test&#39; their device the same day we play-test the game, which is strange, but whatever. Anyway, please contact me ASAP at this number: (061)219\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or you can reply to this email, and we will arrange a time for you.<br />\nThank you!<br />\n-Matt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T13:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a8d/a8dc762e22e5fda0846e276472754147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DEVBEEF"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DEVBEEF"], "esrb_rating": null}
