War had been good business. Things are getting tough all over Europa and you need to find ways to make ends meet. An offer arrived one morning from a kingdom far from home for a stable job, and you took it right away. You now find yourself commanding the Segson Archipelago, unknowingly involved in something far greater than you ever wished for.</p>\n<p>Destiny has merged the path of two young souls and two patriarchs, each striving to better the world for themselves and those around them. How far will their legacies go? Whom else will you meet?</p>\n<p>Make, buy, or take ship parts from sources all over the game world and fit them into over 25+ available airship frames. Balancing speed, agility, durability, and firepower, with efficiency will be keys to the strategies and tactics that earn you victories.</p>\n<p>Exercise the best use of tactics and skills of your crewmen. You are in control. Push the capabilities of airships and crew to their limits. It\u2019s the only way to enjoy the spoils of war.</p>\n<p>The continent is vast and it has many things to offer, many stories to tell, treasures to collect, and mysteries to unravel.</p>\n<p>Ports and merchants across the map offer parts, ships, and all sorts of other items. Each merchant is different and will buy and sell specific things. Demand and supplies are also limited to the nature of the settlement they come from.</p>\n<p>Producing, processing, transporting, assembling, and manufacturing goods and weapons is what fuels Europa\u2019s economy. While skyfaring, freelancing, and privateering could earn you a good fortune; supporting, arming, and commanding a fleet require your wit and resourcefulness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-14T11:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c3/2c35fd1c54c1febbceb21bbf777d798f.jpg", "website": "https://www.revolution-industry.com/kingdomsadrift", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 368, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revolution Industry"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Freedom Games", "Gamersky Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
