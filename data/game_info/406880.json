Also to add to the challenge the Player character has a hard time staying upright. I have no idea why that is happening ;p</p>\n<p>It is a little on the weird side. Not something I consider graphic but if you are sensitive you might wanna skip I guess or just play it.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is a short level with one boss to beat. I've had a lot of laughs making and play testing this project. Leaving in intentional issues.\u00a0Hope you all enjoy!!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.\u00a0</p><p>Game Song by:<br/></p>Alexandr Zhelanov, https://soundcloud.com/alexandr-zhelanov", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T05:09:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/080/080a002fbc01e3d07c9135db4d86e92e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Melodicfish"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
