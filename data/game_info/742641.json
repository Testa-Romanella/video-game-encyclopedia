He takes them to the ports where the chimneys are smoking. He earns points for this, but if he doesn't get cargos on time, he doesn't get them. The steering is quite simple: you need the arrow keys or WASD for this. You can also change the quality settings (the default is low quality, so you can change for a better one).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T08:03:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26c11b49cddf9f17f4926d79d554b600.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dan Games UA"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
