{"id": 456670, "slug": "space-apothecary", "name": "Space Apothecary", "name_original": "Space Apothecary", "description": "<p>Thanks for checking out our game.</p>\n<p><strong>Space Apothecary</strong> is a metroidvania developed for <strong>Metroidvania Month 8.</strong> The premise is that you play as an apothecary on a strange planet. Your goal is to collect plants, make potions, heal patients, and develop bada** power-ups.<br/></p>\n<p>This is our first month of development so this is\u00a0an early prototype build. We ended up spending a lot of time writing boiler plate. Here's some key information to get started playing the game...</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>W-A-S-D-Space: for basic movement.</p>\n<p>Primary Button Mouse: Point your mouse in a direction relative to the character\u00a0and left click to attack in that direction.</p>\n<p>Secondary Button Mouse: Point your mouse in a direction and right click to dash. Note, dash does not override regular horizontal movement. Instead it amplifies or opposes it. Please feel free to move around in the home base to get a feel for the controls.</p>\n<p>I (the letter aiy): Opens your inventory. ATM there's nothing you can do with it. In other builds, you can use the weird water tank at home base to craft potions, but for the purpose of this build, we decided to leave out that feature.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Nuances/Tips/Help/FAQ:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>How do I get past this plant that's blocking my way? Try dashing through, and see what happens.</p>\n<p>What can I kill? Unfortunately, we didn't have time to tune the combat, so not everything is killable yet. Small stationary enemies are not killable. The giant one is, after 4 hits. Sorry, visual indicators would have helped, but we didn't have time.</p>\n<p>This platform is so high, how do I reach it? If there is a waterfall nearby, try dashing a second time after dashing through it. Otherwise, there are some areas you can't reach, because we hadn't had the chance to develop the power-up to enable you yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How does this waterfall mechanic work? Unfortunately, the nuances aren't expressed visually ATM. When you pass through the water fall, you gain an extra dash, if you have already dashed. If you start in the waterfall, and dash, you will not gain another dash--i.e. you must dash THROUGH, and not FROM to get a dash refresh.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T06:34:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53d/53d8a13c2c9b14810ed93eaf2e144e52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["chenfahsa"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
