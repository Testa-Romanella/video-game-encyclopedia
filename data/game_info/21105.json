I would like to thank all of you who tried and played the game, like or dislike it.  A lot of the players dislike Final Slam 2 and if you compare it to other full-blown mainstream competitive fighting games and you don't like it, well, your dislike for the game is justified and I understand.  With very limited budget and with only one person working on the game (which is myself), as opposed to bigger-sized indie or mainstream companies, I understand that I cannot provide the best graphics, gameplay and most modern features to satisfy the hardcore fighting gamer.  Therefore, I decided to make it more of a casual game and focus on the uniqueness of the game that not many fighting games have.  And this uniqueness comprises:<br/><br/>1. the character creation mode with speed creation settings<br/>2. Final Slam Season Mode where you can win titles and fight up a league (fight with characters you created as well)<br/>3. the automatically-generated AI fighters in season mode.  <br/><br/>Other features include the ability to export your fighter to a text string that can be saved and shared anywhere you like.  Therefore, it is possible to create an unlimited amount of characters.  Some players have had a lot of fun playing the game, but some haven't and others don't even care about what the game has to offer.  But anyway, I accept all opinions and judgment about the game and welcome you to try it out at a low cheap price.  You can request for a Steam refund if you feel it is not for you.  Thanks again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:29:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d6/9d6808b7bc6ab57424ce4565a259677b.jpg", "website": "http://tamugaia.com/finalslam2", "rating": 2.1, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 310, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 429, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tamugaia"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tamugaia"], "esrb_rating": null}
