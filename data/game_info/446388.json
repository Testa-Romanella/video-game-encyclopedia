First Demivile must face a series of challenges in order to prove himself to the Gods above. Demivile must fight and defeat the 3 \u201cIudex\u201d ranked deities that serve as guardians of the Heavenly realm in order to achieve angelic status and be freed from the demon ranks of Hell. The first Iudex deity stands guard at the gate between Hell and Purgatory. The second Iudex deity guards over the realm of Purgatory. The final Iudex deity stands guard at the very gates of Heaven itself. If Demivile is able to fight and defeat these ancient Iudex deities, he will have proven himself worthy and be able to serve under the Heavenly ranks and as an angel.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>The controls are mouse and keyboard.
