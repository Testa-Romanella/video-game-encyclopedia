Then there would be a transition moving you to the next part in the story.</p>\n<p>So, I developed my own little engine for interactive stories in Unity using \u00a0my own little markup format to define links, variables and conditions.<br/></p>\n<p>And I called it... WordClicker! (secretly hoping it would be as famous as the cookie clicker game... =P)</p>\n<p>It was originally planned as a Halloween game, but I did not finish in time. :(<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Just click the highlighted words to advance.
