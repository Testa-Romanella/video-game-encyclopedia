<strong>Zaher</strong> the developer of this game and you gonna read now a small notes about this game to know how it works.<br/>In this game you have to stand as long as possible against the evils, the more waves you stand the more score you gain,in each new wave you gonna face a new type of enemies<br/>\u00a0<strong><br/>First: Game difficulty\u00a0sittings<br/></strong>This was\u00a0made to fit all the players experiences and to give the opportunity to challenge yourself by making the game harder.<br/>When you run the game you gonna see a 5 input fields represent the difficulty of this game .<br/><br/>1- <strong>Time before enemies attack:</strong> this time is like a save time to get your solders ready in the field before enemies start attacking you.<br/>2- <strong>Time between each enemy:</strong> when the save time finish the enemies will start attacking you one by one and there will be a small period between each one of them and this input filed allows you to control this period of time.<br/>3- <strong>Time to start the\u00a0first wave:</strong> after this time a couple of enemies are gonna attack you at once without a period between them and the number of these enemies is considered by the last input field\u00a0(Number of Enemies in each wave).<br/>When you\u00a0hear the sound of enemy horn\u00a0that means troubles are coming and the wave has been started.<br/>4- <strong>Time between each wave: </strong>after the first wave there gonna be an infinitive number of waves and the time between the last wave and the next wave is considered by this field .<br/>5- <strong>Number of Enemies in each wave:</strong> this number of enemies is gonna attack you at once when it's time for a wave of enemies to attack as i mentioned above.<br/><br/><strong>Note: be sure that you are entering only real numbers without any letters or other symbols\u00a0or you gonna get an error message.<br/></strong><br/><strong>Second: The Game Play<br/></strong>When you press the <strong>Start </strong>button you gonna see a bar contains the solders cards, each card has a cost to create a solder using it, you can simply drag and drop the solder from the bar to the filed and this field is considered as square blocks, in each block you can create one solder.You can not create a solder in a block that contains an enemy\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Characters of the game:</strong></p>\n<ol><li><strong>Worker:</strong> You gonna start with only 6 gold and this means you need first to create workers to
