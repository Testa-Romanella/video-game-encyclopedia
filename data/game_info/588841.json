This game won second place at the Metropolitan site on GGJ 2021.</p>\n<p>You are a ghost that is sick and tired of waiting to be reincarnated, so you decided to build your own mannequin so you can possess it. Unfortunately, due to your poor memory, you forgot where the rest of your body parts are. Your memory also affects your navigation so after just entering the new room you \"forget\" the previous one. Try and find all 4 missing body parts by doing different puzzles. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T08:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b3191485e9687a8f069c621ff51f50b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["milosst686"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
