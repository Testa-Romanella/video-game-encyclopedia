Based on a<strong> dystopian future </strong>where everyone lives in a<strong> simulation</strong> except the player.\u00a0 It's a<strong> difficult </strong>and <strong>short game</strong>, but it's incredibly <strong>rewarding to speedrun.\u00a0</strong>Instead of just killing the enemies with contact like in most platformers, in NEOTALES you have to fight with them. It's a short but challeging demo, so let me know you'd like more levels with brand new features!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move.</li><li>Space to jump.</li><li>TAB to reset the level.</li><li>Control to go to the menu.</li><li>F to shoot the enemy.</li><li>In Menu, Arrows and Intro to select options.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T10:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f3141a60f9a5e6bce7d8a9093697784.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pichudavid"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
