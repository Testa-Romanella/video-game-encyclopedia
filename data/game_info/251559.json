{"id": 251559, "slug": "combo-jumper", "name": "Combo Jumper", "name_original": "Combo Jumper", "description": "Combo Jumper is a first person platformer. The core mechanic of the game is combo points. You gain a combo point every time you wall jump and each combo point multiplies how far you jump on the next wall however upon touching the ground your combo points get reset so to make a large jump you have to make consecutive wall jumps to make larger jumps. The levels of Combo Jumper get progressively harder. Combo Jumper includes 8 levels but don\u2019t underestimate the amount of playtime you get because of the steep difficulty curve :D.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4d1fcf1ee7b3c8df1abf1e403d6d6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Veathen Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Veathen Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
