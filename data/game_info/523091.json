Literally every minute someone in the town becomes sick and can no longer work.<br/>You will have to examine and cure sick bunnies by making prescription medicines for them.<br/>Sometimes it seems that there is no end to the patients and you will have to open new hospitals, or even better, take friends with you and look after the sick together.<br/><br/>Even when it seems that the situation is hopeless and you cannot save your patient, this is not the end. You can always revive the bunny with the great power of the Artifact. But remember that you have to pay for everything.<br/><br/>Each patient will bring you a reputation, depending on your actions, which will be needed to open new hospitals, as well as to buy medical outfit.<br/>If your reputation falls below zero, then you will no longer be able to accept patients. But don't worry - there are no irreparable situations. Earn a reputation by working with the locals to mine crystals. All for the good of the hospital.<br/><br/>And don't forget that good doctors wear masks, robes and wash their paws.<br/><br/><h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>3 hospitals<br/></li><li>reputation<br/></li><li>medical outfit<br/></li><li>patients' revival</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T03:27:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d1/5d17916b641ee4e6f0234b11fbf42ea4.jpg", "website": "http://dillyframe.games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DillyFrame"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DillyFrame"], "esrb_rating": null}
