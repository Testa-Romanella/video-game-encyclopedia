{"id": 447067, "slug": "obreno-chapter-1", "name": "Obreno: Chapter 1", "name_original": "Obreno: Chapter 1", "description": "<p>Obreno is an interactive visual novel\r\nfrom Out Of Time Interactive. What currently exists is a prologue\r\n(which is mostly non-interactive) then first chapter, out of five\r\nchapters. Other than that I think this version is close to finished\r\n(though there may still be some changes), and will hopefully also\r\nrelease on Mac, Steam and iPad soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>\n<p>In the distant future, a search for\r\nyour missing brother leads you on a journey through an intergalactic\r\ncivilization that might have reached the limits of progress.\r\nFollowing clues that point to groups who want to return to living\r\nlike early humans, the imminent end of money, a seemingly mythical\r\nplanet, and the galaxy's only android, your path takes you onward,\r\ntowards the edge of the inhabited galaxy.</p>\n<p><strong>Future</strong></p>\n<p>Although a plan exists for the\r\nremaining chapters, I'm currently not planning on completing them,\r\nand instead intend to move on to less ambitious projects in a similar\r\nformat. But if a lot of people seem to be reaching the end of chapter\r\none (I think it'll take 1-2 hours), maybe I'll decide to finish it.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Out of Time Interactive is just me,\r\nAlex Franks. I've been working on interactive/multimedia fiction\r\nprojects for several years, but this is the first one to be completed\r\n(to the extent that it is complete). </p>\n<p><strong>Contact/Links</strong></p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, it would be useful if you could let me know at\u00a0contact@outoftimeinteractive.com</p><p>I think the best way to hear about any updates on this or other projects will be to follow my Facebook page, here. But I don't really know yet.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T02:37:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf0/cf0219558280034fc38a6c85b3c4abf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Out Of Time"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
