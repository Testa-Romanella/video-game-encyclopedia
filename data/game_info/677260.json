Instead, you'll have to put your first astronauts to mining work and get some raw materials. Once you have some iron, carbon, sand, and sulfur, it's time to set up your first steel mill and concrete factory to start laying down some infrastructure. Even necessities like food and oxygen require a steady production chain that must not be broken!<br/><br/><h3>Transport Infrastructure</h3><br/>InfraSpace simulates every. single. car. Each resource you ever produce needs to be transported to a factory for processing and each product needs to go to a habitat for consumption. Your road network can handle a lot, but without your oversight it will grind to a halt and drown in traffic eventually. Build highways, roundabouts, and multi lane roads to ensure the production heart of the city keeps beating.<br/><br/><h3>Population Growth</h3><br/>Your first colonists will be astronauts, the best and the bravest humanity has to offer. Give them food and shelter and they'll keep your outpost running no matter what. As your settlement grows, you need to cover the increasing workload by employing scientists and engineers, which require a few more creature comforts. Any city of sufficient size will sooner or later be home to more and more families as well, so make sure your schools can handle it and you are able to deliver the latest VR-edutainment products as well.<br/><br/><h3>You don't have to play hard</h3><br/>Traffic management can be fickle and survival can be tough. You can adjust the difficulties of both to make your city management experience as easy - or as hard - as you want it to be.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-19T01:07:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/857/857dfa7d0a74b1ce9656d84a6526fa2c.jpg", "website": "https://infraspace.dionicsoftware.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 40, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dionic Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dionic Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
