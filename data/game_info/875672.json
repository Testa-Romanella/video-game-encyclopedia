{"id": 875672, "slug": "attack-on-voxelburg", "name": "Attack on Voxelburg", "name_original": "Attack on Voxelburg", "description": "<p>A Gameboy Advance game for the gbajam22. <br/></p>\n<p>Source code on github: https://github.com/MutantStargoat/voxelburg<br/></p>\n<p>Fly over a 3D terrain, find and destroy all enemy defense pods, before they manage to shoot you down. Your final score depends on the time it took to take out all the enemy pods, and damage you sustained.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>D-Pad: turn left/right/up/down.\r\n</li><li>A: fly forward.\r\n</li><li>B: shoot.\r\n</li><li>L/R triggers: strafe left/right.</li></ul>\n<p>Tip: to avoid enemy fire, either strafe when its weapon has charged up and ready to shoot, or shoot it first to disrupt the charging process. Turning away and running also works.<br/></p>\n<p>The game jam was running for 3 months, but I only started working on this game the last 2 weeks of it. The jam version doesn't have music, sound effects, a high score table, and is basically a prototype. But it's playable, and the voxel landscape engine runs reasonably fast on the GBA.<br/></p>\n<p>If you're running the game on a GBA or GBA SP, with the original unmodded display, it might be worth switching the \"colors\" option in the main menu, to the \"GBA/SP\" setting, which boosts the brightness and saturation, to compensate for the dark display. For use on a modded GBA with a backlit IPS display, a Nintendo DS, or an emulator, you should leave the option to \"IPS/DS/Emulator\". The setting will be saved automatically to the cartridge SRAM, if it is available, so you won't have to change it every time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T14:20:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a97/a9755eb447b1e823a0aa6807d97f8332.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nuclear"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
