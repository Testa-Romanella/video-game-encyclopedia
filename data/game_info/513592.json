Neil Young... can save us all.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Use the Q, W, E, A, S, and D keys on your keyboard to gather the power of the 6 scions to multiply the power of Neil until the 88 second ETA is up. <br/><br/>Share your high score with a screenshot\u00a0on Twitter by tagging @CisHetKayFaber.
