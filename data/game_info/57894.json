It is the second game in the TOCA series. Mainly an annual franchise update of cars and tracks, the game added more detailed graphics, physics, multiplayer modes and other minor features. Fictional (but realistic) tracks were added, and support races such as Ford Fiestas, Formula Ford and others also arrived. The level of car damage possible during a race was also enhanced, which was a significant selling point compared with the likes of Gran Turismo which had no damage model at the time. The background music features E-Z Rollers&#39; &quot;Retro&quot;. Other versions feature &quot;Sole Sentiment&quot; by Ratman in the opening intro.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-19T08:19:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d18/d18859f470dec72d24cee443d0bab646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Codemasters"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
