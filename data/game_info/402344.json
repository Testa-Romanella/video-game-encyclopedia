However, my current plan is to make it a chill, rogue-lite style experience.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>In this game you pilot a small space craft</strong><strong> on a peaceful mission to explore </strong><strong>the remnants of a fallen galactic civilization. Your primary task is to broker diplomatic negotiations with the stratified human settlements you find, on behalf of a revolutionary government. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>You'll warp between proceduraly generated star systems and encounter all kinds of strange mysteries and perils on your journey through a practically infinite galaxy!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The project is in active development and will remain free for the time being; but will be given a reasonable price on final release.\u00a0 I'm also aiming to deliver free content updates </strong><strong>o</strong><strong>ver the course of the Alpha!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Donations are accepted and are a great way to let me know you're invested and help me deliver updates more regularly!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Also don't worry; it is not going to\u00a0be a re-tread of No Man's Sky or Star Citizen. I'm going to keep my scope small and deliver content iteratively; making sure I polish what works, rather than letting myself succumb to feature-creep. I also have no plans for adding crafting systems, survival mechanics or entire other genres as mini games; I aim to keep this project simple and focused! <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>No bloatware, I promise!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS: <br/></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mouse: Aim/Turn</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>W: Boost</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>S: Slow Down</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A &amp; D: Roll</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left Click: Fire Weapon</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Right Click: Scan Pulse</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>LShift: Toggle Free-Look</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Enter: Bring up Warp Menu</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Esc: Pause/Settings<br/></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T03:29:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d925316b922ce659cab407f9cc51e51e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Siris Pendrake"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
