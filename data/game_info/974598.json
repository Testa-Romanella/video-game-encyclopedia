Decide the details of the surgery you will perform from the x-ray results and then enter the operating room to plan the surgery and get preliminary information. Get the preliminary information that is part of the training.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Realistic Feeling in the Cut Tissue with its Rich Mechanical Structure</strong><br/>Apply all interventions during surgery realistically. Feel the bone sensation at the highest level with the drilling mechanism.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The mechanics are not limited to this. Cut with a saw, select the appropriate size prosthesis, take measurements and place the prosthesis by fastening it with screws.
