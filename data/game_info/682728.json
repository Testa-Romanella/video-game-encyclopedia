It's possible.\n\nBut, what it really tells me is that Outhouse Media are wise enough to not develop</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7a/a7ae31dbef489d11f6751bf118ab990e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
