The fundamental gameplay is enhanced with the ability to use 'aftertouch' to apply spin to the ball and curve it on previously impossible trajectories. </p><p>On top of this is the \"rogue-lite\" progression system where every game incrementally affects a wider meta-game. Every time you play, collecting and using power-ups, building combos and performing trick shots will rack up Coins. Coins carry between games and let you permanently unlock powerful upgrades for all future games. Soon you'll be breezing through previously challenging levels, pushing through to higher scores and new levels, before finally facing the King Brick!</p><p><strong>[ Features ]<br/></strong></p><p><strong> Fun, simple arcade action with addicting long-term appeal</strong><br/>Master your control of the ball with spin and swerve<br/>Multiple ways to play: Play \"Classic\", \"Jukebox\" or \"Attack\" modes<br/>Track your scores and compete with your friends</p><p><strong>Spend coins to unlock a vast arsenal of powerful upgrades</strong><br/>Increase your powers with an improved paddle, extra ball-spin, increased scoring, better combos, more 1UPs, and more!<br/>Feel the excitement of more plentiful and powerful Power-ups!<br/>Unlock the ability to exchange spare Lives for a screen full of extra balls!<br/>Bend space and time with the Forcefield, Powerup Wormhole, Ball-It Time, Attrition and \"The Finisher\"!<br/>Unleash advanced weaponry!
