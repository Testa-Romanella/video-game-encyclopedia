Also means that the game may be polished in the future; I was just getting it to a playable state for school :)</p><p>The goal of the game is to destroy the other players base. You do this by buying nukes (circles), and increasing the power of your anti nuke gun (Upgrade is shield shaped). Buying nukes increases your cash per second allowing you to buy more nukes! Player1 will use \"w\" to buy, and \"A\" and \"D\" to change selection. Player2 will use \"Up\" to buy, and \"Left\" and \"Right\" to change selection.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c98/c98ce50100c89fbe60b2ba2f93683b6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JrodManU"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
