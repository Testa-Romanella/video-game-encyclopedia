It was released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles, and MS-DOS computers. Unlike the film and real rules of basketball, each team plays 3-on-3. Players have a choice whether to play as the TuneSquad or the Monstars. It features basic controls and 2D graphics. The game was developed by Sculptured Software, who coincidentally had developed the Looney Tunes-based basketball game Looney Tunes B-Ball for Sunsoft the year prior to the production of the Space Jam film, and published by Acclaim Entertainment, who coincidentally had been publishing the NBA Jam series of wacky-themed basketball games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-16T22:02:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/882/8821b43bbcbabcf782e2270212280c56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.09, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 507, "game_series_count": 23, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Sculptured Software"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Acclaim Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
