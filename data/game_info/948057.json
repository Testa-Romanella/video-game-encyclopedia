It is focused on a single Deadnaut, rather than a whole squad. The action is more intimate and tactical, and you can develop your Deadnaut with numerous suit upgrades and abilities. Furthermore, the gameplay is turn-based, not real-time, which helps focus the action.<br/><br/><strong>How does this relate to the original Deadnaut (2014)?</strong><br/>Deadnaut and Deadnaut: Signal Lost are both situated in the same universe and feature similar, mission-based gameplay in procedurally-generated locations. Furthermore, in both games you take on the role as a remote handler who controls the action \u2018at a distance\u2019 via a physical console. The Deadnaut also uses similar weapons and suits; battles against security systems; trades \u2018knowledge\u2019 for gear; and can be cloned upon dying.<br/><br/><strong>How many levels are there?</strong><br/>Deadnaut: Signal Lost is designed to be fast, easy to pick up, and replayable. There are roughly 8 - 16 levels in a standard game. With five suits, special game modifiers, multiple difficulty levels, over 100 upgrades, loads of gear and procedurally generated campaigns, we think you\u2019ll be occupied for a long time.<br/><br/><strong>Isn\u2019t everything \u2018roguelike\u2019 these days?</strong><br/>Deadnaut: Signal Lost has many genre-defining features, such as turn-by-turn tile-based movement, character progression, procedural generation and permadeath.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T04:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/463/46350bfb547c866f5bf52bd84a0f9a54.jpg", "website": "https://signal-lost.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 438, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Screwfly Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Screwfly Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
