It was incredibly vivid and the second I woke up from it I realised that there was no aspect of it that I wouldn't be able to make, so I decided to make it for the hell of it. It will only take you under two minutes to complete. Sound is required.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Jack for helping with Blender related business: https://claufiersoft.itch.io/hendecad<br/><br/>There is one image credit required which I will post here.
