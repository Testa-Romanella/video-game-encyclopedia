The only playable level puts you in a cage with a couple of pieces on the floor. Put them together to save your life!</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>This game was made for a personal weekend game jam. The topic was <em>\"Tension\"</em></p>\n<p>I like doing game jams and a team of people i knew were doing an internal one. I took their topic and did one of my own.</p>\n<p>The idea of the game is that you have to quickly solve puzzles to stop bad things from happening to you.</p>\n<p>I wanted to create a sense of tension between the player and the world. Like you were fighting for your survival.</p>\n<p>Some of the other level ideas include things like</p>\n<p>- Trying to escape a room that's flooding</p>\n<p>- Trying to stop a vehicle from driving off a cliff that you're stuck in</p>\n<p>- Or even as bizarre as trying to figure out how to stop a bear from gnawing away at the cable that's holding the bridge together.</p>\n<p>If you want to see more comment below and support the game! I'll even make a version for regular PC!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63f/63fa7bf356d8d0019bc18f2df81164de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sun Dryd Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
