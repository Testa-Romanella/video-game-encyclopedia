It features the alligator (the player) in a battle against the enemy, Myra the Fallen. The battle is currently a defense system, where the way you defeat Myra is by dodging all of his attacks. There is not much for the game right now, but more could be added later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also I could not figure out a way to have the battle start after the 4th text box, so once you collide with Myra, wait about 25 seconds and the battle will begin. Sorry about that!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T13:48:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee9/ee9fa7e3683976d2623aa561dd86c82d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tii.zelda"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
