Solve the five unique platforming puzzles\u00a0to help Braxton get from froggie church back to their home!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Braxton possesses the unique ability to switch between solid and ghost form at will, which helps them to complete some puzzles and navigate the world effectively. Navigate through ghostly logs while in ghost form and interact with torches in order to remove obstacles that solid Braxton otherwise couldn't move around.\u00a0Completing the five different puzzles will all require a combination of Braxton's solid form and ghost form.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>View the source code here<br/><br/><br/>Programmer/Level Designer:<br/>Andrew Struthers<br/>Technical Artist/Animator:<br/>Robert Struthers</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T16:48:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e32/e32db02f2c811533708e9cf6bfb4b2f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AStruthers2000", "robert_struthers"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
