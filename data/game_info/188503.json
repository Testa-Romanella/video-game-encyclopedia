(Kinda):</p><p>Spiritworld</p><p>The Crystal Forest, my homeland. I live here with many others of my kind, protective spirits, which roam across the mysterious plains of the Glass Mushrooms. The Crystal Forest extends farther than I ever have been, so days go by without meeting anyone of my kind. From a hill between two old Glass Mushrooms I can see the old way, which lost its path to the City of Emptiness. The city is for me only a silhouette on the horizon and I have rarely encountered its inhabitants. But once it seemed to me that something has happened in the city, like the city and the country were attacked by something strange.</p><p>Since that day the \u201eSpectre\" appear, spirits who no longer live here and the elements, that had been long forgotten. Whatever happened, it must have happen there, in the City of Emptiness.</p><p>My forest is restless, the crystals whisper and the trees strum. Therefore I willare, I'll follow the old path an find out whathat has happened in the City of Emptiness.</p><p>Prototype by Myriel, Manuel and Kasia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db4/db44dcddfe2bdc6d0dcdc0d98d83fc53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kamieniew"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
