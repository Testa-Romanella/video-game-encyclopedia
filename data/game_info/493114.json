In <strong>Bucharest</strong>, one of the most polluted cities of <strong>Romania</strong>, there is a place called<strong> Delta V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti</strong>.  President Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu wanted to build a water reservoir and as a result he created a concrete dam to surround the lake. Somehow, he couldn\u2019t finish his project so the place remained forgotten and became the dump of the town. Years later, the nature bloomed and many species flourished within the confines of the dam. The biodiversity encountered there is considered by some to be comparable to that of a small river delta.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n\n<p><strong>W,A,S,D </strong>or <strong>arrows </strong>for walking</p>\n<p><strong>Shift + W,A,S,D</strong> for running</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> for jumping</p>\n<p><strong>Tips: </strong>Don't move the player when interacting with other characters (use click only to press Next)</p>\n\r\nMeet the creators:\r\n\n<p><strong>Game lead:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<em>\u00a0 Ionita Iulia-Petronela</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Dev Team:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Daniel Pandele</em></p>\n<p><em>Margarit Dorel-Alexandru</em></p>\n<p><em>Emanuel Suceu</em></p>\n<p><em>Stefania Chircus\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Rebeca Daduianu</em></p>\n<p><em>Teodora Alexandra</em></p>\n<p><em>Mirela Hreniuc</em></p>\n<p><em>Florin Moroldi</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Coordinators:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Alexandru Berceanu</em></p>\n<p><em>Diana Vasile</em></p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0P.S. <em>Leave a comment bellow if you played, any kind of feedback will be helpful for the development of this game ^^</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:19:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1b59a735630b2882c485199ab2d5ec3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ela Grey"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
