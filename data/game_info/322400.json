{"id": 322400, "slug": "click-defense", "name": "Click Defense", "name_original": "Click Defense", "description": "Click Defense is a simple game about clicking things... fast. It's half click trainer, half tower defense, and it's sure to put your mouse skills to the test.<br/><br/>Your home town is threatened by frequent meteor showers, and has developed a defense system to combat them. But someone needs to man the turret! As meteors hurtle towards the town, your only goal is to shoot them down and protect everyone you love.<br/><br/>To aid you, you have a tech tree that you can choose offensive or defensive upgrades from. Are you fast, but imprecise? Upgrade your missile tracking! Are you precise, but slow? Upgrade your shield!<br/><br/>If you can make it through 10 nights of increasing onslaught, you'll be the savior of your town! And you'll have gained skills that allow you to excel in other games that benefit from precise clicking, such as Osu! or first person shooters like PUBG.Features<ul><li> <strong>Steam Achievements</strong> \u2013 Challenge yourself to improve your skills.<br/></li><li> <strong>Razer Chroma Integration</strong> \u2013 Get visual feedback from any Chroma or Chroma-Linked devices you have.<br/></li><li> <strong>Tech Tree</strong> \u2013 Play the game your way with tech tree progression.<br/></li><li> <strong>Transferrable Skills</strong> \u2013 Exercise skills that improve your play across other games and genres.<br/></li><li> <strong>Short Sessions</strong> \u2013 Need to warm up your clicker while you wait on friends to get online?
