The rocket is something I modeled myself, everything else has been raided from the free assets of Unity Assets Store. More in-depth credits to come! This is the result of\u00a0 amazing tutelage\u00a0from our amazing instructors at Riveria, a lot of youtube coding tutorials to supplement what has yet to be taught, and a lot of no sleep and a lot of caffeine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T08:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df1/df16e129e70da1914fcae0bf3e72f61e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["joraelart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
