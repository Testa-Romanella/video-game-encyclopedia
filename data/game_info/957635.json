Each character has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Abandoned foster kid and monster-slaying tough guy survivor Jack is great at teamwork and fights harder when his health is down. June is an expert at kicking zombie butt as she is adept at seeing monster intentions and evading attacks. Super-rad scientist Quint can choose his gear on the fly and is exceptional at using buffs and debuffs, while former bully Dirk is a super-strong monster-battling tornado who can shield anyone in combat.<br/><br/>Play from more than 400 unique cards and embark on over 30 quests that follow the events of the first book. Unique to the Last Kids on Earth:Hit the Deck! is the story deck, a combination of cards representing the options available to the characters based on their location and ongoing story elements. <br/><br/>Your options are further expanded with a crafting table where you can refill consumables, upgrade gear, and even create your own custom cards tied to a specific character! The post-apocalyptic world may have ravaged the population and society as we know it, but on the plus side there\u2019s no homework, no parents, and no rules!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T11:20:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b1b4b4cb58658148f0892e28b1b7b82_lTS5teq.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SMART Technologies"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card", "Educational"], "publishers": ["SMART Technologies ULC"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
