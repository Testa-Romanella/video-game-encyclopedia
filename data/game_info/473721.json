At first, things seem well enough, but after, things start falling apart. There is a murderer and you must try to find out who it is by surviving and taking risky chances so you can end this murderers scheme.</strong></p>\r\nWARNING:\r\n<p><strong>THIS GAME IS A HORROR GAME. IT CONTAINS BLOOD, GORE, DISMEMBERMENT, SCARY IMAGES AND OTHER THINGS THAT MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR SOME PEOPLE. ONLY PLAY IF YOU KNOW NONE OF THIS WILL AFFECT YOU.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\r\nWHEN WILL THE GAME BE RELEASED?\r\n<p>Im thinking I will put it out the the public in about a few weeks. The game will cost a dollar at launch and will cost more as I progress the game, the more it will cost. I am really hoping I can get it out as soon as possible so I can show the world what iv'e been working on for the past five months. I will also release a mobile version a bit after the release\u00a0just to see if I should or should not. Read my notes below to see more. You can check out the crappy\u00a0trailer I put apart tho.\u00a0</p>\r\nAwesomeness Games Notes:\r\n<p><strong>This game is still in major development. If you encounter ANY bugs, be sure to tell me. This game will be updated as much as possible to make you satisfied with the game. Also the mobile version is very buggy, I've\u00a0seen people play my mobile version</strong><strong> of other games I made and some say it doesn't\u00a0work and some say it does work</strong>\u00a0<strong>on there phones so download mobile version at risk. The computer version on the other hand, is not buggy at all so I prefer you download that version! :)</strong></p>\r\nWANT MORE NEWS, SECRETS AND EVEN A CHANCE TO WIN A FREE VERSION OF THE GAME WHEN IT COMES OUT?
