This time I tried to make a simple but fun puzzle/platformer game called Blocky Stars. In this game you have to control the character that moves only left or right, and try to fall and stomp all Blocky Stars to recover their stars. Everytime you move, the Blocky Stars will move too, so be careful where you step! There're 15 stages in this demo version (I'm planning to keep making it in a full game in the future). Can you beat all them? There're other gimmicks and mechanics you'll learn while you play. Hope you all have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d03/d03d36d235a401bfc3c43bf3000b2867.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["manoelpdb"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
