As a licensed Kill It With Fire exterminator, it\u2019s time to fight back!  Gather your arsenal and pursue the eight-legged menace on a journey across time, space, and suburbia - although not necessarily in that order.<br />\nTo defeat spiders you must exploit their one weakness: FIRE. Or bullets. Or explosions, throwing stars, gettin\u2019 smushed by stuff...pretty much anything, really.  But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be easy - first you\u2019ve gotta find the spiders.  Use state-of-the-art arachnid tracking technology to pinpoint your quarry\u2019s location among hundreds of potential hiding spots - then, torch everything and smash the spider with a frying pan after it runs out.  It\u2019s the only way to be sure.FeaturesDozens of weapons.<br />\nCreepy crawlies.<br />\n\u201cRealistic\u201d fire simulation system.<br />\nGratuitous chaos and destruction.<br />\nFinally learn the truth about spiders.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-05T20:53:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a96ccd1d451aef96be6ca1f1fe12134c.jpg", "website": "http://www.killitwithfiregame.com", "rating": 3.38, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 1034, "beaten": 28, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 23, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 67, "ratings_count": 47, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 48, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "iOS"], "developers": ["tinyBuild", "Casey Donnellan Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild", "Casey Donnellan Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
