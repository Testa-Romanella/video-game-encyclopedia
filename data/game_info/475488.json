The Theme that was tasked to create for this year was the theme of 'Repair'. From initial discussions with my team of 5, including me, to writing ideas on the blackboard we can around to the idea of a fun physics game that uses the theme of 'Repair' to repair a derelict and very damaged ship to progress from room to room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as the\u00a0engineer raiding a Titanium Graveyard, a collection point for derelict space rigs. You need to fight against both gravity and hostile invaders as you repair the craft, hoping to fly it free.</p>\r\nDev Team &amp; Credits to:\r\n<p>Aaron Drinkwater,<br/>Elliot Martin,<br/>Jacob Carr,<br/>Isobel McNeany,\u00a0<br/>Natalia Pietrzak.</p>\r\nFurther Instructions\r\n<p><strong>Team's Global Games Jam Page:</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/titanium-graveyard-9</p>\n<p><strong>Jam Site:</strong>\u00a0 Bristol #GGJ20 ( @UWE_Foundry @UWEBristol )</p>\n<p><strong>Jam Year:</strong>\u00a0 2020</p>\n<p><strong>Platforms:</strong>\u00a0 MS Windows</p>\n<p><strong>Tools And Technologies:</strong>\u00a0 Unity (any product)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T04:03:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/940c17765bec585ddbe313f694f4249d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Drinkwater"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
