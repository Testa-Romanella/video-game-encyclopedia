Test your wits in this flash-game style point and click puzzler.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was designed and made in 5 days for the Spring 2023 S&amp;T Game Jam. This is by far the most art I've ever had to make for a game, which is why I went for the MSPaint 'style' to save time. My original plan for this game was way overambitious, and even included a secret ending that I wasn't able to add. But I think the result is still a very\u00a0full-featured jam project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T14:10:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cce/cce12523c4d758ab45ef636046b90406.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Athakaspen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
