You will know you are not close enough if you dont see shakes or hear hi hats when you jump/crouch.</li><li>The Rhythm sections after the first one at the start of the game have a different beat patterns. To identify this, check when the the neon lights blink.</li></ul>\r\nPlatform Sections\r\n<ul><li>No need to jump with the beat. Just move as you please like a normal platformer.</li><li>The starting controls may be limited but once you get double jump, things get really fun :)</li><li>Moving platforms give a tremendous boost in jump if timed properly.</li><li>Moving platforms are in sync with the music</li><li>For wall-jumps, if you put pressure on the wall, it will propel you further away.</li><li>Jumping next to the wall without pressing on it will propel you less, essential for climbing tall walls.</li><li>It is suggested to jump, glide, double jump when nearing the destination, then glide again for best results.</li></ul>\n<p>This game has been greatly inspired from\u00a0Celeste\u00a0developed by\u00a0Matt Thorson\u00a0and\u00a0Noel Berry</p>\n<p>Made Using\u00a0GameMaker:Studio\u00a0and\u00a0Waveform free</p>\n<p>Art, Music, Level Design and code made by\u00a0Chico Perez (GrizzliusMaximus)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:30:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a91/a9190b5b254ab400b86e9bb99ca06be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrizzliusMaximus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
