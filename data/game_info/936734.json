And YOU must lead them.</em></p>\n\n<p>This game is inspired by the Fire Emblem series. Specifically, the Radiant/Tellius Saga (FE9 and FE10). It's a story about overcoming prejudice and hate with kindness and compassion....and stabbing too I guess.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is balanced to be slightly challenging, but still beatable for new and old SRPG players.\u00a0 It's heavily story and character focused, as I believe that's the most important of any FE game...or story in general to be honest.</p>\n<p>Enjoy fun features such as:</p>\n<ul><li>Talking and lots of it</li><li>Interesting maps with decent challenges and gimmicks</li><li>A large cast of fun characters.</li><li>Archers being useful</li><li>Nature magic!</li><li>Fantasy racism oh wait that's not a fun fea-</li><li>AND MORE!!!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Currently Playable: Act 1(The Silver Battalion) Chapters 1-7</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T07:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/693b78c1ec16adb00abe3bd074b1553b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WyvernPaladin"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
