(You may get stuck in the floor due to the hitbox detection, just keep jumping until you get out, that was kinda out of my control).</p>\n<p>You can change the colors of the letters, once that is done you can jump into the center of the wheel\u00a0(the freezing of the screen is intentional). Then the cover screen will fade in!</p>\n<p>(You can also click on the screen and on the character as a fun extra)</p>\n<p>---------</p>\r\nDesign and Process\r\n<p>A big help throughout this was learning about p5.play, great addon that let me create a platformer-like game without a ton of hassle, a lot of documentation on how to use it was also helpful. My original idea was to be able to control the character (his name is Hyzer) on screen to change the letter colors, which would then make the whole screen (the \"poster\") change into a different color palette. As I was making it, I\u00a0added the little spinning wheel when clicking, and I thought it would be cool if it turned into a portal to jump into. I made a lot of custom art and assets just for this, like the character images and animations, as well as having to export every single letter in the logo so they can change color individually. I took care in picking the color palettes for the elements as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In terms of coding, the easier part was actually the movement, I got that done first. The harder parts were making the hitboxes for the letters so they change when you touch them (I had to make a separate hitbox for the big E since it was hard to hit than the other letters with the way I\u00a0was doing them), and honestly that fade-in animation. I tried like 5 different ways to do fade transitions but I just had to make the frames manually and use a work around way to animate them. It was hard work that I spent a bunch of time on (as you can tell by when this was done) but I think I was able to make it work pretty well!</p>\n<p>By the way Dread Beat and all the art and characters are by me! It's a game and story concept that's my own creation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T11:07:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/217/21702b75a87060becfbda4f259ae5572.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Computerstickman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
