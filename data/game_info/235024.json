The mountain itself perched over the battlefield like a lion welcoming its prey. Even the sun ominously \u2018turned black\u2019 during the desperate struggle that ensued, experiencing a total eclipse at the height of the onslaught. January 22nd, 1879\u2026 the Zulu would call it \u2018The Day of the Dead Moon\u2019.<br/><br/>Not unlike General Custer\u2019s approach at the Little Bighorn, just days before the battle Lord Chelmsford, Commander-in-Chief of British forces, would split his command at Isandlwana, moving to reconnoiter the Zulu in force. Chelmsford\u2019s decision would eerily lead the proud British 24th Foot to the same fate as Custer\u2019s famed 7th Cavalry just three years prior.<br/><br/>As the battle began, the Zulu would appear to grow out of the earth itself, as some 20,000 warriors hastily took up the \u2018Horn\u2019s of the Bull\u2019 formation and readied for the assault. The British stared out over the veldt and into eternity\u2026 the camp was surrounded, surrender was not an option, and retreat was impossible. From the \u2018Red Soldiers\u2019 the Zulu expected no quarter and would give none in return.  uSuthu!<br/><br/>ZULU DAWN! The Battle of Isandlwana is an abstracted company level strategy game that puts the player in command of the British 24th Foot or the scores of deadly Zulu Warriors at the Battle of Isandlwana, long regarded as the worst military disaster in British imperial history.<br/><br/>Though a turn based game, its randomized activation system will at times make you feel as though you're playing more of a real time strategy game. With any given action, enemy reaction may at times be immediate or concurrent.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><br/>- Quick, interactive, engaging Turn Based Play<br/><br/>- Scenario Variant Overlays: Laager Up! . Centre Column United . kwaJim's Can Wait<br/><br/>- Variable Zulu Commitment Levels plus randomized troop levels and weapons<br/><br/>- Immersive 3D Graphics, Sound, Special Effects and... even a Solar Eclipse.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c6/2c6921745bffe457f5b04398d261c091.jpg", "website": "http://www.digitalGameworks.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["digital Gameworks"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Digital Gameworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
