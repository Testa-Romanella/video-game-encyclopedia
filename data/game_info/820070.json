{"id": 820070, "slug": "moitiom", "name": "Moitiom", "name_original": "Moitiom", "description": "<p>This game is incomplete and rather simple.</p>\n<p>The initial idea was that different kinds of insects would fly across the screen and you would earn money by catching different types according to a goal presented by the game. These goals would be things like: catch only asymmetrical butterflies, catch only ladybugs, etc.</p>\n<p>I ran out of time once again, and the finished product only lets you drag the insects around the screen. There's no scoring system in place yet. I had a lot of fun making this game and learned many new things about Godot, but the game is not particularly fun to play at this time. I am planning to add more features to it at some point in the future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T22:20:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b7/7b7f21a7d049f4c24af8ae7e1acad3c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["greenherring"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
