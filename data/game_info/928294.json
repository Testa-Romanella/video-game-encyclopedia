In these cases, players should advance toward each other for a final attack or may Dock the Crank and end the game to score their respective pieces.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Players may Dock the\u00a0Crank at any point to save the current board state</strong> and continue the game at a later time. This is suggested. <em>Backing out to the Playdate's Home screen from an active board\u00a0using the Menu button may cause erroneous save data when loading back into Chek.</em> If this happens, please choose to start a new game.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>GOALS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>I would love to apply a <strong>minimax algorithm to add a Basic CPU opponent</strong>, but will have to think on its implementation.<strong> I am open to help with this! </strong>You can reach me\u00a0on the\u00a0Playdate Squad Discord\u00a0and Twitter @LDBR_art to talk design.\u00a0<ul><li>You can also <strong>Leave a Comment Below.</strong></li></ul></li><li>You could pretty easily play this <strong>multiplayer on stream or in a zoom/discord</strong> with one player controlling the Playdate and others calling out their moves ie \"<strong>B2 to B3, attacking Open Circle\".</strong>\u00a0I'm open to developing an asynchronous multiplayer method using a code system to send/receive board states.\u00a0<ul><li>Happy to talk with interested parties that would like to help.</li></ul></li><li>I also REALLY want to show the version of Chek that plays with a Pack of Cards or to\u00a0<strong>develop the framework further</strong> and include Hero/Class mechanics. This release is the first step towards those goals!</li><li><strong>More than anything, </strong>I want to see this game played and see people exploring strategies. I have it up for Pay-What-You-Want but truly - if money is an issue, just download it and tell me what you think! Or take the rules below and play it IRL with friends. Game it out! Break it! <strong>Have fun and Tell me about your experience. </strong>That's why I made this game.</li></ul>\r\nChek Board Game\u00a0\r\n\n\n<p><strong>Chek\u00a0</strong>is a board game for 2 or 4 players, designed to distill small-scale conflict from large-scale strategy. In its most basic form it can be played on an 8x8 board with a set of pieces and a pair of dice.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SETUP</strong>: 8x8 standard chess/checkers board, 24 pieces, pair of 6-sided die</p>\n<ul><li>A player's pieces are designated by a unifying color or symbol\r\n  </li><li>First player is chosen arbitrarily\r\n  </li><li>Play moves Clockwise\r\n  </li><li>For a Standard 4-player game, 6 pieces occupy the middle squares on each side of an 8x8 board. Other beginning setups possible for 2 or 4-player matches, decided on by the participants</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>MOVE</em></strong>: Each turn the current player moves a piece of their own, one space in any 4-way direction</p>\n<ul><li>Players may MOVE or ATTACK once per turn\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>ATTACK</em></strong>: An ATTACK is a MOVE onto an opponent-occupied space</p>\n<ul><li>Players attack adjacent pieces in any 4-way direction\r\n  </li><li>Each player rolls a single die - High roll wins / Defender wins ties\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>BULLY</em></strong>: Attacker gets <strong>+1</strong> to their attack roll when two or more of its own pieces are 8-way adjacent to contested space.
