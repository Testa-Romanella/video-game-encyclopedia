The feeble forces that remain would have been no match for the Roborts when they came from BeyondZone, until they began to war with clones. Fight Roborts to impress Space Gods. Win $Honor for honor. <br/><br/><strong>YOU ARE CLONE. FIGHT FOR URTH. DIE FOR HUMANS. AWAKEN IN THE GREEN TO DIE AGAIN.\"</strong><br/><br/><strong>ARROW KEYS TO MOVE, SPACEBAR TO SHOOT.</strong><br/><br/>Continuing my way through the Unity tutorials. There is no win state because I am tired and do not know how to make one yet. But in war, there are no winners, so it's pretty thematically on point. ;-)<br/><br/>Music (\"Restricted Zone\") by Eric Matyas<br/></p><p>www.soundimage.org<br/><br/></p><p>All other sound effects from the Unity tutorial prefabs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90ee4a9e3e1619c57f024674231964d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HellaMeaty"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
