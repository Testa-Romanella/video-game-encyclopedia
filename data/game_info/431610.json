A bell rings out across the street for sunday service and drowns out the reassuring hum of the television. You squeeze Blue Bear tightly and thumb the remote as you try to ignore the surrounding chaos. It's moving day, again.</em><br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Art by Richard Tongeman<br/>Code &amp; Writing by Tony Jeffree<br/>Music by Richard Campbell<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Tools used:<br/>INK<br/>Fungus<br/>Dotween<br/><br/>Asset Packs used:<br/>Cartoon Furniture by Jesper Kondrup<br/>Cartoon House by Kaos VR</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T09:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dca/dcaabf436540c5d5b8004e38543023ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["far few giants"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
