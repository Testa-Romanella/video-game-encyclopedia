There is a tutorial and a level editor in the game that you can use to create unique and mind-blowing levels. You can save these levels and play them, or you can download other people's levels to see what they have created. There are new features, enemies and tiles added in every update.</p><p>In the future, story mode will be added, with levels made and arranged in order to tell a story. There will be nine unique regions, each with its own set of levels. The regions will vary from the Garden of Eden to the Depths of Hell, with each incorporating their own tile set, enemies, bosses (TBA), and adventure.</p><p>I<strong> have an idea for the game!</strong><br/></p><p>We will gladly take in any positive feedback and criticism, and hopefully incorporate it in our game!</p><p><strong>Any features planned for the future?</strong></p><ul><li>Multiplayer support</li><li>More enemies</li><li>More tiles</li><li>More particles :D</li><li>Bosses</li><li>Story mode</li><li>Change more settings in level editor</li><li>Bug fixes (my favoooorite)</li></ul><p>There are patches every week with new content.</p><p><strong>System Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Minimum: </strong><br/>Windows <br/>Intel core 2 duo <br/>Integrated graphics card <br/>1 GB of RAM <br/>250 MB disk space</p><p><strong>Recommended: </strong><br/>Windows <br/>Intel core i5 <br/>Dedicated graphics card <br/>2 GB of RAM <br/>250 MB disk space</p><p><em>We have not tested all computer types, so these are estimated requirements.</em></p><p><em><strong>Patch Notes:</strong></em></p><p><strong>v0.7.0</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Rewrote the enemy class so that enemies are more consistent.
