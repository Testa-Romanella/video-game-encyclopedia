Just skip the donation if for free.</p>\n<p>Also, you can download the html file for a better view,\u00a0Almost like a website when you opened the file. Update:\u00a0Wait, the secret key is not Ctrl any more, and the secret key is on mobile! Now don't worry PC, users, the secret key on PC is just changed to another key instead of Ctrl. And for mobile users, THE BUTTONS ARE MORE FUNCTIONAL! THE LAST TIME YOU HAD TO CLICK ALOT OF TIMES IN ORDER FOR WITZY TO SAY A NOTE. Soo I add update for mobile. And you could mod older versions since I will be putting the latest version on the browser. And you could download the latest files!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T11:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c82/c82b04e2ee0ee0b930bd269e8cbdad20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["WitzyStudios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
