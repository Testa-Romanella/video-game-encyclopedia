I made this for the gmtk game jam but I didn't make it to get in the top 20 games or actually even in the top 100 games. I just made this game to try my hands at a game jam(i haven't talked to anyone in the last two days HELP). This is actually my first game that wasn't just some weird game on scratch. Anyways thanks for listening to my crazy ramblings and have a great rest of your life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:03:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cc/7ccbd897be469fc6de6cb83eeb0cc1e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cornered Acorn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
