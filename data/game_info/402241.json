You'll have a selection of 80 characters to choose for and over 60 stages to fight on.</p><p>**IMPORTANT** If something happen during a match that breaks the game (bug) pressing f4 will reset the entire match.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>What separates my game from traditional 2d fighting games is that the controls for each character have been simplified. Basically to do any special attack for any character is the button input down forward or down backward and then any attack button. for ultimates the button input is down forward or down backward and then any strong attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The button configuration for keyboard....</p><p>KEYBOARD</p>\n<p>--Movement</p>\n<p>Player1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0
