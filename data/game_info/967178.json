It\u2019s wild. All the buff dudes have turned on society. <strong>STOP THEM</strong><br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>MOBILITY TO MAKE YOU FEEL SUPER POWERED:</strong> Levels are playgrounds you can jump, shred, and bounce all over. Grind between rails. Body-surf on enemies. Use water jets, trampolines, poop fountains and pretty much anything to launch yourself heavenwards for huge air.<br/> <br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>MIGHTY WEAPONS TO KEEP THE BUFF AT BAY:</strong> Choose from a modest armory of killy toys, each with dual firing modes and unique functionality. From a trusty hammer that always makes its way back to you no matter how far you throw it, to a revolving potato cannon with backup basketball bombs.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>A WORLD OF POOP AND PURE IMAGINATION:</strong> Your battle against the buff takes place across 18 stages of strangeness. Levels are variously and hilariously themed, such as mushroom, street, cowboy, moonbase, mall, and sewage (don't fall in the brown stuff).<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>HIGH SCORES FOR SELF-GRATIFICATION:</strong> Measure the success of your buff-battering performances by racking up ker-azy high scores. Build and keep your multiplier going for even higher scores. Pull on your big boy pants and put some thunder in your number.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>TOTALLY NUTS, OVER BUFFED BOSSES:</strong> Face off against a freakshow of good and pumped boss dudes. Topple a tower block with bulging biceps. Smack down a sword-wielding trashcan titan. Make mincemeat out of a belly-flopping mushroom king.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li><strong>BEAUTIFUL FOOD FOR YOUR EARS:</strong> Musical maestro Fredrik Rojas works his magic and serves up a magnificently muscular soundtrack, while voice-acting heavyweights Gianni Matragrano and Kevin Miller flex their vocal skills and give BAFTA worthy performances.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T04:27:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daa/daac76e75b883b36474ffd6f5f1355fd.jpg", "website": "https://discord.gg/AGjK7qS", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Buffcorp"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digerati"], "esrb_rating": null}
