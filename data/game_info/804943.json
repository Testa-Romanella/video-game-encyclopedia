You will collect soil by digging, drop them into your panning machine and produce valuable materials. Then you can load them into your truck and sell to the customers. You can find very valuable artifacts and gems in the ground if you are lucky. Besides you will have a museum to show what you find beneath the ground. Tourists will come and pay money to see the museum. Digging gets harder and harder as you unlock new soils. So you need to upgrade your shovel and your character to do things easier.<br/><br/>Features<br/>- Easy to play with just one joystick to do all the work<br/>- Addictive &amp; satisfying digging and stacking<br/>- Manage your dig site &amp; museum<br/>- Upgrade all of your buildings, your character and your truck", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T10:47:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/399b067389e364f87b2ef40b889d89f1_uqBa27K.jpg", "website": "https://www.udogames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["UDO GAMES OYUN YAZILIM ANONIM SIRKETI"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["UDO GAMES OYUN YAZILIM ANONIM SIRKETI"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
