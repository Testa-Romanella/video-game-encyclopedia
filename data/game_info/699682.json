One player controls a giant ogre, and the other his tiny hooded rescuer. Both players must use each character's unique skills to escape from the dungeon the ogre has been caged in, avoiding or defeating guards and traps that intend to impede their progress.</p>\n<p>Youtube:\u00a0https://youtu.be/20tP4GxfX_8</p>\n<p>Map Tiles:\u00a0https://ninjikin.itch.io/starter-tiles\u00a0by\u00a0SciGho</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T06:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/12128b2ebc5e91ff351a655f806368ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DragosMT"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
