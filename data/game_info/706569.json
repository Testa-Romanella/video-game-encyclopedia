As the game plays out,\u00a0it is\u00a0your job to\u00a0help the NPC\u2019s\u00a0cure\u00a0their inability to\u00a0sleep by\u00a0helping them battle with their subconscious mind.\u00a0</p><p>It is\u00a0within the minds of these NPC\u2019s that we find the main gameplay of Sleepscape. While sleeping, the NPC will go through the 5 stages of sleep, with each stage involving a different\u00a0player controlled mini\u00a0game. Once these 5 stages/minigames have been completed, the NPC will be cured from his inability to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>As well as minigames, the game will\u00a0feature various environments to explore,\u00a0with\u00a0each containing\u00a0several\u00a0interactable objects that give more backstory to the hotel and the\u00a0world.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p><p>This project was created to an Assessment Brief given to us by AIE. Our team worked hard and we hope you will enjoy our efforts :)\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T16:30:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a67/a67002a979dfc3b1a9184329d54647d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CaitieDay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
