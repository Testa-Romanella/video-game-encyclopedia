Use your wits and experience to stay alive and keep betrayal and the Chanyu raider at bay.<h3>Odyssey in Ancient China</h3>Your area of jurisdiction covers an open world of 50 sq km of farmlands and rice fields to lush forests, swamps and mountains bordering the areas of the Chanyu.<h3>Stamp your Authority</h3>Enforce your rule to maintain order and productivity whilst responding to village needs, conflicts or raids from the Chanyu. Lead or order raiding parties on the Chanyu to inflict revenge or steal resources. Your decisions affect how your enemy and peasants respond.<h3>Memories and Interactions</h3>With hundreds of peasants and warriors, every character has their own identity with specific memories and experiences that shapes their skill, attitude and behaviour. Morale, loyalty and obedience is not guaranteed, beware of treachery.<h3>Player Skills</h3>Skills are not limited to fighting, movement or objects, build memories and create confidantes to help identify those who'll betray and undermine your authority.<h3>Take Command of Your Garrison and Jurisdiction</h3>Manage the specialized resources of your garrison as you customise squads of warriors and peasants as they enforce your will, go on patrol or into battle.<h3>Villages and Peasants</h3>The peasants all have skills related to the type of produce of their home village (e.g. cart driver,  livestock tendering, crops, cloth etc) and work collectively to produce output for their village and the emperor. Take control of your jurisdiction and manage it's production output, food and resources reserves.<br/><br/><br/>Resources can be moved between villages or stolen from the Chanyu clans of the Xiongnu. Peasants can be captured from the Chanyu and used to bolster your work force.<h3>Use the Resources of the World</h3>Use the resources of the world to boost morale and reward your peasants.
