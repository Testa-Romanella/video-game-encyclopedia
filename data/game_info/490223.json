It has an incomplete story, and doesn't have much to do at the moment, but it is still very new, so this may all change.</p>\n<p>Walk is the sequel to my game Through the static, which was a Scratch game I made for the 2019 Scratch Jam, and was the sequel to my first Scratch game I ever made, Water Game. I only decided that this would be a sequel after playing my old Scratch games again, and saw that I was making a story, which had ended with a 'To be Continued...'. If you want to play Water Game\u00a0or Through the static, search for the user DXA06 on Scratch. Through the static can also be downloaded from Itch.io.</p>\n<p>The Mac and Linux versions of Walk are not tested, and may not work properly. Currently there is no controller support, but might add it sometime in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T06:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec2/ec27e1c98fd7da099c5d30d39d77648b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["703337"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
