Backbone\u2019s OST is expertly crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape that serves and enhances storytelling.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mature\u00a0content</strong></p>\n<p><em>Backbone heavily features strong language, themes of violence, systemic racism and sexism, drug abuse, depression, terminal illness, body horror, death.
