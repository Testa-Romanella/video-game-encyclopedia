{"id": 120058, "slug": "all-is-fair", "name": "All is Fair", "name_original": "All is Fair", "description": "<p>All is Fair is a role playing game that imitates the experience of being a girl in high school. It drew inspiration from bullying and power dynamics between cliques. To simulate this experience players are asked to interact with the experience while wearing blue or red glasses, which makes them see different things on the screen. This mimics girls getting different bits of information through gossip, altering their perspective. Ultimately the game serves to explore female power and encourage girls to build each other up instead of bring each other down. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/180/1804af4b1920ad492d28a8d27a4707b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["katewallace"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
