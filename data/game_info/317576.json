Once he collects this level he immediately begins\r\nrunning out of the house and the main boss begins his hunt for dinner (the\r\nplayer). The first level is home to the reaper, and he utilizes the undead\r\n(zombie hands) to try and capture you. These zombie hands are death boxes and\r\neach time the player falls into these traps a horrible scream is heard from the\r\nplayer. The player makes his way to his next destination by reaching the next\r\nboss, which is the Skull Ice King. In this next environment the player repeats\r\nthe process, but his next method of surviving is jumping over the bosses\u2019 ice\r\nbarrier and floating platforms. The nightmare is only beginning as the player\r\nprogresses to the next level which is the domain of the Scary Pumpkin. In this\r\nlevel the player jumps over witches\u2019 pots that are filled boiling material. The\r\nnightmare continues to the next level which is dominated by the Scarecrow.\r\nDuring this level the player must jump over spikes and runs into a cornfield.\r\nFinally, the player finally reaches the last level which is a circus filled\r\nwith acid puddles and guides the player to face all the previous bosses. The\r\nplayer must jump over them by utilizing the platforms over the head of these\r\nbosses. Once the player completes this, he is finally free from the nightmare\r\nand he goes on to live out another day.</p>\n<p>This game is available only for PC.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assets Used:</p>\n<p>None of the Assets were made by me.
