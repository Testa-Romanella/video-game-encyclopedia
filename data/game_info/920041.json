The team of 4 had 1 week to make a game based on a previous one along with an aesthetic twist.\u00a0Our team decided Pac man with a vaporwave feel. \u00a0We were like wise told to make 2 separate levels as displayed in our game.\u00a0<br/><br/>Controls:\u00a0<br/>Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move , Escape to leave the game, and mouse to click through.\u00a0<br/><br/>How to Play:\u00a0<br/>Move around the map collecting pellets.\u00a0When you collect all the pellets, you go to the next round. Keep playing until the ghosts take away your lives. After an amount of pellets, fruit will spawn. This will increase your points.\u00a0You can use openings in the level to teleport from one section to another, and use large pellets to eat ghosts in order to gain even more points. The goal is to try to beat your highscore.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>Individual Itch.io:<br/>Ryan:\u00a0https://icecleric.itch.io/<br/>Elon:\u00a0https://grante.itch.io/<br/>Alex:\u00a0https://vgm11.itch.io/<br/>Jasmine:\u00a0https://little-fifth.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T07:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cc/2cc6852de02cffd768a102b1617d3784.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Code Worm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
