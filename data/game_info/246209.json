I just couldn't stop thinking how it must've felt to be all alone in a vast empty landscape with no awareness of where to go.</p>\n<p>Features (so far):</p>\n<ul><li>Riding\u00a0simulation is fully physics based. There are no 'fake' forces involved. It's all body shifts, steering, precession and\u00a0tire-surface forces. ...(ok, ok, the only fake forces are when you put feet on the ground, that's a bit wonky for now)</li><li>9999999+km\u00b2 to explore</li><li>Every speck procedural</li><li>[SPOILERS]</li></ul>\n<p>Please don't block the game if your firewall asks you.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE CURRENT VERSION: the current version can be considered an early alpha. Don't jump onto reviewing it or spreading [much], it will probably be in a good state\u00a0in about a week after most issues (that I know of) are\u00a0fixed and some\u00a0things improved.</p>\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>a02:</p>\n<ul><li>Fixed [hopefully] a game breaking bug where you would sometimes spawn under the terrain on start</li><li>Added a shorcut icon</li><li>Added the obligatory walking-simulator-zoom-when-holding-right-click\u2122</li><li>Reduced mipmap bias of trails to make them more visible from distance</li><li>Improved and added better tutorial text that explains all keys now ingame</li></ul>\n<p>a03:</p>\n<ul><li>Whole new surface model:<ul><li>Surfaces now have varying sink rate, bumps and resistance</li></ul></li><li>Rider now leans forward for a more natural pose</li><li>Better elbow positioning</li><li>Tweaked surface type distribution</li><li>Halved number of particles when rolling over\u00a0sand to reduce sudden fps drops</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa4/aa4bd3f11b68884c10425556050b50b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nothke"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
