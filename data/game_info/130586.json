In the future, it should have aliens you will have to fight against, using the environment to your advantage.</p>\n<p>This is my first solo game project. I am using Aseprite for the textures and animations, and GameMaker Studio 1 to code everything and put it all together. I also have plans to edit my own sounds and compose the soundtrack myself.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little prototype and I would <strong>love</strong> to get feedback from you.\u00a0Also consider donating if you can as it would help a lot with development !</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li>Left and right arrow keys to move</li><li>Down arrow key to crouch</li><li>Shift to equip the assault rifle</li><li>Mouse to look left and right</li><li>Left mouse button to shoot</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90c/90cafdeaa228beca51a9f1fb90543b9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KwakWack"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
