However it costs no fuel to land on space stations which is also where you can refill your tank. Money is earned by completing quests which can be found on the many different planets. If you don't know where to go for a given quest try asking one of the cities for directions they will give you the name of the planet that the city\u00a0you're looking for is on,\u00a0be careful your spaceship can't remember the planet's name so that's all on you.\u00a0\u00a0Try to survive as long a possible.</p>\n<p>In this game you travel around a small universe delivering items to different planets. This is the first game I have ever finished and currently is just the bare bones of what I want it to be. I plan on adding new updates to it eventually so if you don't like it now maybe come back later and try it again (But I'm not your dad so I can't tell you what to do).\u00a0 Enjoy my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:28:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/671/671f77c5566367a46130276bd52d2592.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["imIsaac"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
