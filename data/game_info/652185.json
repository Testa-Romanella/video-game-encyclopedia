In an effort to cut off India\u2019s sea lines of communication, the PRC has dispatched fighters and reconnaissance aircraft to Sri Lanka, in preparation for the arrival of a PLAN convoy transporting fuel, weapons, troops, and supplies.\u00a0 If the PRC can set up a fully supplied air base in the heart of the Indian Ocean, Chinese stealth fighters can strike Indian shipping at will, effectively shutting down India\u2019s war effort.\u00a0 In this game, you play India, and you must stop the PLAN convoy from reaching Sri Lanka.\u00a0 You must also transport supplies and reinforcements to Indian bases in the Andaman Islands.\u00a0 If you can reinforce the Andamans, you can keep the PLAN out of the Indian Ocean indefinitely.\u00a0 The Chinese will reign down DF21s on any ships that they detect, and the Bay of Bengal will be crawling with PLAN attack submarines, so be careful!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T01:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59ae027f72292b41874ab0b1fd53c8fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["africacrossgames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
