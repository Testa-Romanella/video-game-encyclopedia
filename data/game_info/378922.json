The regular Windows version is the version that was completed when the deadline ended, so any problems there will persist, but we're continuing to work on the game.)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>You're welcome to download the source from the GitHub link provided, but if you use any of it, it would be nice to credit the programmer (Alex Van Liew) or the artist (Jonathan Fischer) for it.
