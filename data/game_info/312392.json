The prototype is being worked on everyday.</p>\n<p>This is our first multiplayer game\u00a0at Pongo Games\u00a0and I hope that we get lots of suggestions and positive feedback. Our team is made up of 3 people. We all work on the game but our main roles are\u00a0Joshua Bradley as Lead Designer and Artist, Shemar Mahase as Programmer, and Brian Soto as a Sound, Art, and Level Designer.</p>\n<p>This game was inspired from the stunning visuals of the snow maps\u00a0in the Frost Bite engine derived by EA's Battlefield V.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:50:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6e/c6e7d561ac23e7011529bf168193668c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jawsh"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
