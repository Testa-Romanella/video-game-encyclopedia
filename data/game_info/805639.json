Totally playable, and you really should.\u00a0As for my plans for what could have been and what-may-be, future-like:\u00a0There were to be many more tracks to play in the Spotty app, many more channels and Direct Messages in the SlackOff app, and more apps. There were to be many more physics click-and-draggables and entangler-bobs. There were to be puzzles and professional voice actors. There were to be raytraces and path-traces and traces of illicit substances.</p>\n<p>I didn't bother with WebGL build because of the graphical fidelity, which is somewhere between Frogger and Cyberpunk 2077. Also it has lots of Physics interaction, and stuff that WebGL generally doesn't play nice with.</p><p><strong>Credits: </strong>Mostly \"TheBaseMesh\" for the 3D models I carefully selected.<br/><br/><strong>SFX:</strong></p><p>https://freesound.org/people/Anthousai/sounds/406493/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Dig2008/sounds/67239/</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/isometric-office-1</p>\n<p>https://www.cgtrader.com/items/2160088/download-page</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/gregstermatic/sounds/336680/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/shpira/sounds/317080/</p>\n<p><strong>Icons:</strong></p>\n<p>Logout: https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik</p>\n<p>Username, Connection People, User Folder: Icons8 Tanah Basah https://icons8.com/icons/authors/v03BjHji0KTr/tanah-basah/external-tanah-basah-g...</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>A Magical Journey Through Space by Leonell Cassio</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/leonellcassio</p>\n<p>Creative Commons \u2014 Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported \u2014 CC BY-SA 3.0</p>\n<p>Free Download / Stream: https://bit.ly/a-magical-journey-through-space</p>\n<p>Music promoted by Audio Library </p>\n<p>Space Jazz Cafe by The Loyalist</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/the_loyalist_official</p>\n<p>Creative Commons \u2014 Attribution 3.0 Unported \u2014 CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>Free Download / Stream: https://bit.ly/3HKaz42</p>\n<p>Music promoted by Audio Library<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T16:56:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b56/b5691e32c7d7f7771e218c0737f03952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beard or Die"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
