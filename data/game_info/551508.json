Unfortunately it took me too long to code all the point and click mechanics as I wanted to use them for further projects. So the game itself has only two rooms with sprites I already had.<br/><br/>So you know, look out for future games :)<br/><br/>The controlls are classical point&amp;click. Left click to interact, right click to change mouse mode and click on the chest in the left corner to open/close the inventory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T10:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06b/06baeaaf850726197153875d567b4d9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pixelcrustpunk"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
