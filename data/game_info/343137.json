The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.</p>\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n<p>Move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Only one disk can be moved at a time. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.<br/> </p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Click on a rod or close enough to move its top block. It will rise indicating that it has been selected, then click on the destination rod to move it.</p>\r\nWEBGL\r\n<p>You can play the game here without downloading anything.
