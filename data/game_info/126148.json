There was no hope for the human race. The world is now his play toy, spawned full of unimaginable horrors only a sadistic child could conjure. You are a survivor but for how long depends on how long you can entertain Robusgun. In a game that never ends until you do, you can never win and that is exactly how Robusgun wants it.</p><p><em>25/06/2014 UPDATE 1:</em></p><ol>\n<li>Added more crates</li><li>Improved spawns</li><li>Added credits</li></ol><p>\n<em>\r\n\tFEATURES</em>:</p><ol>\n<li>Unlimited game play time</li>\n<li>Highscore based</li>\n<li>Time based</li>\n<li>Level based</li>\n<li>Multiple weapons</li>\n<li>Awesome Music</li></ol><p>\n<em>\r\n\tADDITIONAL INFO:</em></p><p>\r\n\tPlatform:\t\tWindows\u00a0</p><p>\r\n\t\tInitial\u00a0Release:\t24/06/2014\u00a0</p><p>\r\n\t\tPrice: \t\t\tFree\u00a0</p><p>\r\n\t\tFinal Release:\t\tWhen it is finished!</p><p>\n<em>\r\n\tCONTACT and BIO:</em></p><p>\r\n\tI am Robusgun, currently working on world domination and weapons of mass destruction.\u00a0</p><p>\r\n\tI am studying at Media Design School in a Game Art course working on attaining a Bachelor of Creative Technologies.</p><p>\r\n\tIf you wish to contact me, email me at \r\n\t<em>chaxic@gmail.com</em>.\r\nFeedback on this game would be much appreciated and will be considered towards the final release of the game.</p><p>\r\n\tThank you for your time\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41a80c475e8165a71538cd71bb51d99f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chaxic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
