The object of the game is to build bridges within each of 24 different levels. This is how your little workers are able to move heavy cargo (including crates, safes and even elephants!) from one side of the valley to the other.<br/><br/>With every level, the difficulty increases. Players must build bridges across larger gaps, up and down inclines and around obstacles in their path. They are also given access to new building materials and may use money collected in the game to build the longest bridge they can. Those who wish to have a break from game levels can also do so by entering Challenge mode.<br/><br/>\u2022 Building and simulation modes <br/>\u2022 Twenty-four levels of complexity <br/>\u2022 Egyptian and Greek themes <br/>\u2022 Amazing physics engine <br/>\u2022 Step-by-step help system <br/>\u2022 Addictive gameplay <br/>\u2022 Bonus Challenge mode<br/><br/>Use your creativity and skill to build bridges simply by drawing with your finger on the touch screen.
