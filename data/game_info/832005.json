Each sacrifice brings you closer to summoning the dark lord. Death is not the end... Death is progress!\u00a0</p><p><strong>Story: </strong>Your inept cult leader has forgotten the ceremonial knife for performing sacrifices. However just to your luck there happens to be a cthulhuaid(poison) vendor right across the street. Look both ways to cross the street as you try to die on the sacrificial ritual sites so you can summon eldritch horrors beyond our imagination.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my submission for the August 2022 GDL Game Jam. I was using this game jam to force myself to try out Rust and Bevy, as such my progress was slow, however I had a lot of fun and learned a ton. Glad to add these new tools in my tool belt. I hope you all enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you to @theionkid for throwing together this knee slapper tune for the game music.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T07:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48cfe4292606658a1bb3f63aa47152a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["xtr3m3nerd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
