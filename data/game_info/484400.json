It's not quite a complete game, but I figured it would be best to submit what I have available. There are a few issues I didn't have time to fix within the time limit for the game jam, but by all means, offer feedback, criticism and suggestions for improvement. This was made in Clickteam Fusion, by Jonathan Oberg.
