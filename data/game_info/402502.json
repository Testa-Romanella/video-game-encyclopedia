{"id": 402502, "slug": "toy-story-1995", "name": "Toy Story (1995)", "name_original": "Toy Story (1995)", "description": "<p>Toy Story is a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game based on the film with the same name developed by Traveller&#39;s Tales and Psygnosis and published by Sega. Similar versions were also released for the Game Boy, Super Nintendo and Windows PCs.</p>\n<p>In most levels, the controls are simple and consistent: A and C jumps, and B whips enemies with Woody&#39;s pullstring, stunning them for a brief amount of time. Each level has a predefined objective which the player usually must complete in a set amount of time.</p>\n<p>Toy Story on the Mega Drive achieves several technical feats rarely seen on the console, the most notable being a stage played from a first-person perspective (using raycasting techniques similar to those found in Wolfenstein 3D). It also features a sound driver capable of playing Amiga MOD music files, which is used for the title screen and end credits, and also breaks presumed colour limitations in the cutscenes through clever use of the console&#39;s shadow/highlight mode.</p>\n<p>The Mega Drive version is also the only version of Toy Story that features a bonus mini-game that is played after collecting enough stars. In this mini-game, the player must shoot stars as they appear on-screen before they disappear, earning up to three extra hit points if they do well enough.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-12T16:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4dfa84bfab216349a15a640ccaee7ae8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 9, "beaten": 25, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 17}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 25, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 25, "platforms": ["PC", "SNES", "Genesis", "Game Boy"], "developers": ["Traveller's Tales", "Tiertex Design Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Disney Interactive", "Black Pearl"], "esrb_rating": null}
