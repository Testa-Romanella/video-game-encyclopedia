{"id": 428154, "slug": "amoeba-battle-microscopic-rts-action-2", "name": "Amoeba Battle: Microscopic RTS Action", "name_original": "Amoeba Battle: Microscopic RTS Action", "description": "Amoeba Battle is a new breed of RTS game where you control amoebas as they battle against the infection that threatens their realm. Explore beautiful yet alien landscapes to feed and strengthen your fledgling amoebas - find algae for herbivores, go hunting with carnivores, or just eat everything with omnivores! <br/><br/>Unlike other RTS games, there are no bases to build - amoebas don't build houses or towns after all! New amoebas are created through the miracle of binary fission; well fed amoebas can replicate into two identical amoebas, doubling your army with a click of the mouse! <br/><br/>But multiplying amoebas won't always be enough. When the competition gets tough, introduce mutations to evolve your weaker amoebas into stronger species. Experiment with different amoeba combinations to field a diverse force that can face any threat!<br/><br/>Experience an innovative real-time strategy game on a never-before-seen scale and battle for primordial soup-remacy in Amoeba Battle!<br/><br/><ul><li><h3>TAKE BACK THE MICROSCOPIC WORLD:</h3>Stop the infection and destroy its source in the varied and intense twelve mission campaign. New to RTS? Or perhaps an RTS master? Choose from four difficulty levels to tailor your experience. <br/><br/></li><li><h3>CROSS-PLATFORM BATTLE ROYALE:</h3>Compete against other players in our 18-player free-for-all Versus mode or take on the AI in Skirmish, either solo or with up to two friends, across console or PC.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>INNOVATIVE RTS GAMEPLAY:</h3>Unlike other RTS games, there are no bases to build - you will need to feed, multiply, and evolve your amoebas to claim victory. Every amoeba is not just a fighter, but a potential army via the miracle of binary fission. And through the power of evolution, even the lovable Locust can grow and evolve into an unbreakable Ursa!<br/><br/></li><li><h3>IMPACTFUL TACTICAL DECISIONS:</h3>Utilize the inherent adaptations of herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores to your advantage, such as carnivore stealth and omnivore mobility. Make use of special terrain features, like Spawning Pools that cut replication times in half. Turn the tide of battle with deployable Probes, such as Cryo Probes that slow enemies to a crawl.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>DELIGHTFUL ART STYLE:</h3>Journey through four exotic landscapes and battle with nine species of amoeba, all delicately rendered using a remarkable fusion of watercolors and pixel art. <br/><br/></li><li><h3>FAMILIAR RTS CONTROLS:</h3>Employ fully featured keyboard + mouse controls including control groups, box selection, hotkeys, waypoint queues, and more. If you prefer joysticks and buttons, feel free to plug in a controller instead! </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T12:34:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e39/e39e163fd41ec22b4e8d17f50bcf21a0.jpg", "website": "http://www.amoebabattle.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Grab Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Grab Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
