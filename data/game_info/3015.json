{"id": 3015, "slug": "chivalry-medieval-warfare", "name": "Chivalry: Medieval Warfare", "name_original": "Chivalry: Medieval Warfare", "description": "<p>Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a fun hack-and-slash PvP game based in medieval ages. You can pick one of four classes - knight, archer, man-at-arms or a vanguard with his specific weapons and behead your opponents, stick an arrow in their chest or make a good-old rush with a battle cry and a claymore. </p>\n<p>Also, there is a variety of game modes to choose from. In Free Fro All the player with most points wins the game when everyone battles everyone in this massacre mode. Duel makes a tournament - one vs one fights of knights where only better skill or luck will grant you victory. Team Deathmatch is a traditional mode with two teams and scores that must be reduced to zero in order to win. </p>\n<p>What is not so ordinary for the genre, however, is a first-person camera. You are able to control any movement of your weapon thus creating a unique pattern of your attacks and slicing through enemies in order to win.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2012-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T08:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7f0/7f021d4a3577ac9d591a628a431fc2e5.jpg", "website": "http://www.tornbanner.com/chivalry", "rating": 3.4, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 235, "owned": 5477, "beaten": 189, "toplay": 33, "dropped": 616, "playing": 17}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 290, "ratings_count": 823, "suggestions_count": 643, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 828, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Activision", "Mercenary Technology", "Torn Banner Studios", "Torn Banner"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard", "Torn Banner Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
