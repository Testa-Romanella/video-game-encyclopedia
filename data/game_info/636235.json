Far from the [insert-cool-name-here] bubble that is your home. To get back to your humble abode\u00a0you must traverse the grueling (well rather clean becuz i didn't have any more time for art assets :() sewers ahead. Fight through 10 levels of increasing difficulty and get back before you pop!</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Move around to collect free bubbles scattered around to lengthen your snake ad strengthen your arsenal (basically, they're ammo), but beware the evil red bubbles, for you can still easily be popped, they will shoot their yellow bubbles at you, and you can shoot your collected bubbles back at them! As you move through different rooms through the sewage pipes, you get closer and closer to your home, and the dungeons get harder and harder. Be thrifty and use what you have wisely!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>[W] to move forwards</li><li>\u00a0[A] and [D] to turn left and right respectively</li><li>[Mouse Cursor] to aim<ul><li>[Left click] to shoot. Keep in mind, your own bubbles can hit you too!
