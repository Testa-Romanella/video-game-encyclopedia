Doing nothing to reduce emissions, and giving excuses and inaccurate data when asked to do so. Gaslighting the Australian public by pretending they have believed in climate change all along. Forgetting that people have died, and when reminded that they have, telling lies about how you had made such a mistake. Grasping at the hands of the furious people whose homes have been razed.\u00a0Several Coalition ministers have even gone on record to international audiences, denying climate change and the threat it poses to their constituents.</p>\n<p>All of this was unnecessary and could have been avoided.</p>\n<p>To put it bluntly: when Piers Morgan and Alan Jones are speaking out against our government\u00a0for being too conservative, you know things are really\u00a0dire.</p>\n<p>So I donated to the NSW RFS. And I made a satirical\u00a0game, because that is a healthy way to process my feelings about the bushfire emergency,\u00a0and my feelings about\u00a0the miserable leaders who refuse to lead.</p>\n<p>As I\u00a0am unable to hook up payments to be automatically directed to the RFS or similar agency, I have turned off all payments for this game.
