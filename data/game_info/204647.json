It is better played with headphones.</p>\n<p>Teaching Phonics in the home and the classroom is always a useful tool for students of English. It can be a challenge for children to recognize the difference between English Phonic sounds and some of the lesson programs can be a little repetitive. I notice a lot of people have resources for teaching the phonics sounds but not so many to teach how to construct words once they have learnt those sounds or about the grammar</p>\n<p>The apps i am making are aimed at teachers and parents to follow the little and often method of teaching these skills and phonic sounds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The best way to do this is not to play and play and play but to dip in once or twice a week to practice and learn. This is why i have kept them simple and not to addictive!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you and your students/children have fun learning with these and that you are all reading in no time!</p>\n<p>Please check out my other apps and the ones that will be coming.</p>\n<p>These can be played online in classrooms on www.makingenglishfun.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8b732c0e86b19d84f9b78646bfa5535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Littlehobo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
