What are they whispering?</em><br/></p>\n<p>This solo player role playing game is inspired by H. P. Lovecraft\u2019s great short story of the same name. You play a character whose obsession with The Tomb lets him lose the ability to distinguish between reality and dream.</p>\n<p>The introspective game will take you about an hour to complete. You will need a pen and paper and two dice.</p>\n<p>Will you lose all ties to reality or escape?</p>\n<p>Note: I created this, while trying to get a deeper understanding of the motives, images\u00a0and the writing style of Lovecraft\u2019s short story from 1917.\u00a0 If you know the story, you can play this game to dive deeper into the head of the main character and envision hist thoughts and behaviour in certain situations.\u00a0But <strong>y</strong><strong>ou do not need to know the story to enjoy this game!</strong> In fact, it can be way more fun to not know it beforehand.</p>\n<p>If you are curious, play it once, wait for the next weekend and\u00a0read the short story. Then wait for at least a\u00a0day and play it again. How did your perception of the character and the setting\u00a0change?\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T14:46:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d82/d82e42dd035b0384756809effe75fb81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loxlei"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
