{"id": 113767, "slug": "ballf", "name": "Ballf", "name_original": "Ballf", "description": "<p>Ballf is a voxel based golf style game made with our voxel engine. The game comes with over 20 unique 9 hole courses, and a level editor that allows for unique player created content and custom maps! The Ballf Courses take place in a variety of settings, ranging from your typical golf course to backyards, towns, space bases, giant bathrooms, and floating islands. Pick the best throw trajectory for your shot while gauging wind direction and strength to try and predict the balls trajectory. The different textures each have their own elasticity and friction, which affect how the ball bounces and rolls, making shot placement even more important. Take advantage of the surroundings by using surfaces like leaves to slow your ball, hard surfaces to bounce or roll further, and soft surfaces like sand to stop the ball quickly. </p><p>Ballf is still currently in development, and some features are still being developed. We are still working on a couple particle effects, the soundtrack, 360 controller support, animations, as well as multiplayer and leaderboards. You can follow the development on our website and twitter.<br/></p><p>After trying the demo, please feel free to message us with feedback and suggestions, as we are always looking to improve any aspect of our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509e887683c73f4d9a6e41a628d7cf82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LucidCatStudio"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
