This is a project that I've wanted to make for a while, and have poured a lot of time into. I'm looking to update this project a bunch in the upcoming months, so if you want to help be a part of that feel free to leave a comment with feedback, I'll be sure to read all of them.\u00a0If you really like the game and want to see it developed into something more, it would mean the absolute world if you could consider donating. Even a dollar helps a massive amount, but it is absolutely not required. Thanks for reading, and enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T07:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcc/bcc07658a0df2fe8f34fa6ede9474268.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Legendary_Pineapple"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
