As soon-to-be Jedi approach the Academy on foot they stumble upon two stormtroopers and Dark Jedi that seems to be the reason for the calamity.<br />\nThe game is the sequel to Jedi Outcast and a part of the series of Jedi Knight RPGs from Raven Software. It continues the tradition of sparkling third-person action gameplay adding new stuff to destroy, new missions to complete and vehicles to drive. A player is granted an opportunity to create own character, customize its appearance, choose lightsaber and learn the way of The Force.</p>\n<p>Jedi Academy heavily emphasizes its multiplayer capabilities: there are more than 20 arenas and 6 different play modes to fight your friends and foes that keep gamers playing it even today more than a decade after its release. At its heart is modified Quake III Arena Engine and through the years the game gathered around itself a unique community of fans that mods the jack out of their beloved Jedi Academy.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2003-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T20:15:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7e8/7e8890a662539b1bdefcf57409aef765.jpg", "website": "http://www.lucasarts.com", "rating": 4.33, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 215, "owned": 3083, "beaten": 635, "toplay": 65, "dropped": 146, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 124, "ratings_count": 637, "suggestions_count": 514, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 643, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Aspyr Media", "Raven Software", "Lucasfilm"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Aspyr", "Disney Interactive", "LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
