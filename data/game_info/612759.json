They seem to appear out\u00a0 of nowhere, but always come in large numbers, are highly susceptible to shock and tend to explode quickly. As a result, earth\u2019s surface has been severely damaged, all major cities have been destroyed and the survivors have started to move underground.\r\n<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>After years of research, scientists believe to have found the plague\u2019s source. The bats are supposedly coming from a tiny planet in the outer regions of a faraway solar system.\r\n<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>The Bat Excommunication and Eradication Force aka BEEF was created. It consists of brave young warriors in high-tech animal suits who are sent to BAT PLANET with the mission of investigating and disposing of the threat.
