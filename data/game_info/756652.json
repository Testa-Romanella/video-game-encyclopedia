Mini Mini Farm is fully designed to be played with one hand, making it the perfect game to play while on the way to school or work!<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0Gathering Resources<br/>As you explore the island, you'll come across things that will grant you a variety of resources you can put towards other things, as listed below.<br/><br/>Trees: Trees grow in at least three stages and provide wood or fruit. Fruit trees specifically have a fourth stage that let you pick fruits from them.<br/><br/>Rocks: Rocks are plentiful on the island and, unsurprisingly, provide stones for you to use. Rock piles always regenerate, so don't be shy about breaking them up and taking as many as you need!<br/><br/>Plant fields: Plant fields dole crops, with different types of land allowing you to harvest different types of crops. In particular, you can expect to come across daikon raddishes, tomatoes, carrots, and blueberries, among others. Moving onto a plant field space will make your character automatically plow it. Tapping on that same space once more will make him plant seeds. From there, you'll need to water your plants. Luckily, the soil on the island is rich, meaning no fertilizer is necessary, letting you run a completely organic operation from start to finish!<br/><br/>Sheep: Sheep provide wool. Like any other object in the game, all you have to do is make your character bump into one roaming your ranch in order to get to shearing. Be sure to show these critters affection so they know you're grateful!<br/><br/>Cows: Cows on your ranch let you milk, well, milk from them, turning your regular old island farm into a proper dairy farm!<br/><br/>Ore: Ores you stumble across can yield copper, silver, and more when mined. With some luck, you might even strike gold on the island!<br/><br/>Shrubs: Shrubs are plentiful, growing throughout the desert island and hide coins within their branches. It's a good idea to get in the habit of cutting them to help prepare the ground for harvesting.<br/><br/>Upon collecting them, all of these resources quickly regenerate over time so you don't have to wait long to stock up on more. Make sure to patrol your island early and often to make the most of everything you have available to you!<br/><br/><br/>\u25a0Development Team<br/>Programmer: @CafeBreakin<br/>Graphics: @Vryell, @BrvFlame", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T04:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6f/e6fefa9bb5a67a24cadcc514d5ec5963_0uX1itN.jpg", "website": "https://cobbee.net/ios/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["CoffeeBreak"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["CoffeeBreak"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
