But now it's actually\u00a01v1 2D Dodgeball With Time Travel!\r\n[seems like the fullscreen option completely destroys the performance in some devices -- test both pls]\r\n<p>Basically, you can move and jump around, and either push your ball away from you, or pull it in your direction. ALSO! You can press the rewind button to send your ball back to wherever it was 10 seconds ago! Try to tag your opponent with your ball, and avoid getting hit by theirs at all costs (.
