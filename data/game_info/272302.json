From the outside it looks like fun, the crowds, the viewers, they love it, love you. But from the inside its quite a different story. The game is based on the decisions you make as a player,and the decisions the characters make for you.</p>\n\n<p>Trust is broken and pacts are made in order to get you through the game. In the end will it even matter though? Will you survive? This short game focuses on the world thousands of years into the future, where mutants have bred and humans with limited powers have been born. Your character has been brought into the game of the generation, unknowingly putting herself at danger. The players job is to get through the game unscathed and see which decisions lead to the end.</p>\n\n\n<p>(Music and sound dedications for in game sound)</p>\n<p>(plane effect)</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXZmbAtoaB3tpnXsuQ5Lj8w</p>\n\n<p>Ship Wrek and Zookeepers NCS Mix</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/user/NoCopyrightSounds<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Music Credit: Ross Bugden<br/>Track Name: \"Black Heat\"<br/>Music By: Ross Bugden @ https://soundcloud.com/rossbugden<br/>Official \"Ross Bugden\" YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQKG...<br/>License for commercial use:</p>\n<p>\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...<br/>Music promoted by NCM https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ</p>\n\n<p>Fearless-Purple Planet Royalty Free Songs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/896/89691aad3dd54cbe5313171069f83d70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FalloutFawx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
