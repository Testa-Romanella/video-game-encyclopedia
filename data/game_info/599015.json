If you've played games like Swarm Simulator or Antimatter Dimensions, you should be familiar with these mechanics. However, in Underworld Idle I present my own take on these mechanics.<h3>Game Features</h3><ul><li>Factions (demons, undead, utopians, and blackseekers). Each faction is responsible for producing its own resource. <br/></li><li>Mechanics of creating units. For example, higher demons create lower demons, and so on. The same about units of undead, drowners and warlocks.<br/></li><li>Infinite progression. Start with a small number of resources and expand into a long list of units and huge numbers.<br/></li><li>Infernal Contracts - Prestige Mechanics.<br/></li><li>A variety of locations: lab with energy crystals, junkyard, library with grimoire (containing dark spells).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-17T13:42:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a8/6a8bb0955ffa83279e81d1c12052e7fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 67, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aleksandr Golovkin"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aleksandr Golovkin"], "esrb_rating": null}
