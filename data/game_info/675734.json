Invest some unstability to strike them with a power surge to kill the workers and disable the station.</p>\n<p><strong>- Jam the doors : </strong>reinforcements are coming ! Jam the doors to prevent additional workers from entering !</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0- Cryostasis : </strong>Activate the emergency security measures and freeze the whole place to death ! This will clean the whole room !
