Monsters also want the food, but will inevitably eat up the tree. What you do as the tree's guardian is to fend them off. Remember, if you die, the tree will surely follow.</p>\n<p>(Keep in mind that the more fruit you eat, the more health you have, but its a double edged sword. The more full you are, the harder it is to walk and jump, and the slower your attacks will be :P)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8ea19e07335c50ab4f810d9f6c3ba055.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["laluis1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
