In fact, it\u2019s a social simulator focused on user-generated content: you create your own world, explore and develop it, meet guests and start relationships. The environment you create is only limited by your imagination.</p>\n<p>VRChat provides full body customizable avatars and emotes, emoji, and hand gestures for you to express your feelings. The game features multiple activities, such as Bowling, VR Karaoke and Capture a Flag matches. You can also explore the worlds created by other players and organize and participate in various social events, for example, start a dancing class or musical performance. The abilities are unlimited. VRChat works as a social network that allows you not only chat and share content but produce it in the form of realistic 3D models and take part in activities you maybe not have a chance to try in real life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-16T14:08:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/11f/11fd681c312c14644ab360888dba3486.jpg", "website": "https://www.vrchat.com", "rating": 3.16, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 130, "owned": 3940, "beaten": 73, "toplay": 20, "dropped": 423, "playing": 56}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 502, "suggestions_count": 471, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 505, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VRChat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["VRChat"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
