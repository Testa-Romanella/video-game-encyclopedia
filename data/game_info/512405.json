If you're interested in the source for more than one game, check out my\u00a0Flash Source Code Collection.</strong></p>\r\nNecropolis features procedurally generated dungeons that are never the same twice and a light-hearted steampunk aesthetic.  Few games offer the opportunity to wear a Shiny Monocle of Science!<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Arrow Keys: Move about the tomb, open a chest, flip a lever.\r\n</li>\n<li>Z: Use up one of your disposable tools to disable a trap.\r\n</li><li>X: Drink a patented health tonic.</li>\n</ul>\r\nTraps permeate this dank underworld.  They can be hard to see.  The better your Detect statistic, the more clearly you will see traps.  If you trigger a trap, you may take damage or suffer other disadvantages.  The higher your Dodge statistic, the more likely you are to avoid harm.  The deeper you go, the harder the traps become.<br/>\r\nYou can use a patented health tonic to restore three health points, or a disposable tool to disable a trap.  You can only use this on a trap which is in front of you.  The better your Disable statistic, the more likely you are to succeed and avoid injury.<br/>\r\nOn each level, find the lever to open the stairs further down.  Each level also contains one large chest containing equipment that may increase your statistics, as well as multiple smaller chests containing gold and useful tools.<br/>\r\nCollect as much gold as you can and survive past level 25!\r\n<p>Source code is provided without warranty. It's also a super rough novice project, so it may be rife with errors and bad style.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c96/c968d94b80cdea8f58c05789955d2348.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gregory Avery-Weir"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
