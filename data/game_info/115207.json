Some bugs have been fixed and this release is the 1.0 - soon we compile a 32bit version and a Linux version.<br/></p><p>Hi folks. Are you ready to enter in the O\u00f6cyte universe? This game requires so as to pass through all levels some skill, accuracy and synchronicity. O\u00f6cyte is a <strong>puzzle game</strong> in which you must manage your energy, bouncing on surface, reaching the target... For this game we used many complex mathematical algorithms so as to create a cyclic environment - a quiet mood, but hard to demystify. 50 levels and a last revelation in order to understand this universe are available - with a tutorial at start. Enjoy a clear aesthetic which is similar with an old computer. Can you control the matrix? Then you will become the ultimate master of the O\u00f6cyte. We will add many other levels so as to increase interest of this game.</p><p>You can download a release for Win64 and for Linux (universal).</p><p>All funds will be used for a GreenLight campaign. Thank you for your support ++<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/006d356e86aa675ee96590bd7d504707.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
