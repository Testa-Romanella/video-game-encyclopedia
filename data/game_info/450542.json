Inspired by early pioneers of survival, In Absentia tries to capture that psychological dread that's left us afraid of the dark which many of those earlier games had.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>This game has just entered pre-alpha so there's still a lot of\u00a0bugs and untested features. I'd really appreciate any constructive feedback as this is my first game and I'm working on it alone. Nothing is final , so models, music, animations, etc are bound to change. I'm mostly looking for feedback on the core mechanics at the moment, so that'd be very appreciated.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CURRENT KNOWN BUGS:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>There's a chance that the character may freeze while shooting. This seems to have something to do with trying to move while shooting.</li><li>Although rare, there's a chance cameras may fail to switch. This has something to do with framerate and game time desyncing as a big jump in frames usually happens right before.</li><li>It's not tested yet, but the inventory might not be scaled properly. I'm not sure if that's the case since I only have one monitor.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>I'll update this if more get reported.</p>\n<p>Shoutout to PUREvil for the soundtrack!</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ZqYuswPHIpRpQbOjiSzpw<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T03:27:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa8/fa8d4f1ab239ba30ef873a6f24edaa3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobert758"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
