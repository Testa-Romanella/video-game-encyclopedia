In my opinion it is not a very good game, however I learned a lot in this Jam. I made sure to try to make everything I could myself. And I'm sure the knowledge I've gained from this Jam will help me a lot in the future. To any beginners who are afraid of joining a Jam in fear of making a huge mistake of a game, don't worry. You will probably make a huge mistake of a game anyway, like me. But don't fear that, failure is a natural part of learning, if anything be glad you did it. Because if you failed that means you learned something. Anyways, enjoy this game and let me know what you think! The art style and colors are trying to mimic that of the gameboy! I'm open to any and all criticism, maybe ideas for what I could've done, bugs I might have not catched. Anything at all would be really appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a dungeon crawler RPG gameboy game. Your goal is to beat the RPG. however, there is a price. Don't worry it isn't, a soul, or an adventure or anything like that. It's pretty much just 250 of the in-game currency. You'll spawn in a safe zone where you can access the shop (with \"L\") to upgrade your attack power and speed, as well as eventually buy the win from. From the safe zone you enter the dungeon. The dungeon has infinite levels, all of which are procedurally generated. Throughout these dungeons are Fairies that you will have to slay for money as well as to progress to the next dungeon level (clearing a level of enemies advances you to the next). There are hearts throughout dungeons that will heal you if you take damage and heart containers(they look like orbs) that will increase your maximum number of hearts. You will need these to survive later levels where the spawn rate of enemies increase and they may swarm you (The AI isn't very smart so don't expect much).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A Controls screen is shown at the start of the game, however I will state them here as well since there are two buttons (the start and back button) not mentioned:</p>\n<p>W A S D - movement<br/></p>\n<p>J - Attack</p>\n<p>L - Open shop (in safe-zone)</p>\n<p>Left Shift - walk (for late game when you are too fast to control)</p>\n<p>Enter - the \"start\" button (used in the beginning and in the game over screen)</p>\n<p>Escape - the \"back\" button (used in the safe-zone to return to the title screen)</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is listed as windows only, however it might work with Mac, I haven't tried myself. So mac users feel free to try and if it works let me know and i'll change the platform of the game. Same thing goes for Linux.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T07:07:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d9/7d91dd9c02a2765898a53be6f829c7d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CyberAnton"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
