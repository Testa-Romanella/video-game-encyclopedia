This is a small\u00a0 student project I've been working on for the Oculus Quest.</p>\n<p>STRIKER is a survival game where players must survive as long as possible in a dark arena surrounded by invisible walls with a bouncing orb that targets the player and\u00a0destroys all it touches.</p>\n<p>Every 30 seconds a new round will begin and a new hostile will enter the arena.\u00a0Players can use the aggressive targeting of the orb to their advantage by getting it to indirectly collide with enemies.</p>\n<p>In its current version, the game lasts 3 rounds and there are 3 kinds of enemies you can encounter.</p>\n<p>!!! HEADS UP !!!</p>\n<p>It's recommended players are comfortable with moving in a virtual reality headset using a joystick.\u00a0Your in-game movement is on the slower side but I don't want any of ya'll getting motion sickness.</p>\n<p>Also this game is somewhat flashy,\u00a0 moving bright colors and such. \u00a0Those with photosensitive epilepsy are asked to avoid this game for their safety.
