It's written in <strong>Go</strong> programming language using\u00a0Pixel for rendering and\u00a0Cirno for creating hitboxes.</p>\n<p>It contains 2 non-spells and 2 spells. I used <strong>Nue</strong> as a boss because she's the only character whose sprite sheet I managed to find (at first I wanted <strong>Clownpiece</strong> though). The only graphics drawn by myself are bullet sprites, all the rest is found on the Internet. If you are the owner of some assets used and don't want to see them in my game, contact me and I'll remove them</p>\n<p>The demo was created to show the potential of game development in <strong>Go\u00a0</strong>and my own library for collision detection and resolution called\u00a0Cirno (in the honor of the strongest ice fairy!).</p>\n<p>Also I decided to suspend the development of the demo because I would like to focus on improving my engine before the game turned into a mess (just like Yandere Simulator lol). Also I'm interested in creating a multiplayer 2D game using my collision resolution library,\u00a0Cirno. Yeah, I'm eager to try different things.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of the project, for <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>Windows 10</strong>. Of course I could compile the game for <strong>Mac OS</strong> but I haven't ever held an <strong>Apple</strong> device in my hands.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Esc - exit the demo;<br/>Shift - slow down and show the player's hitbox;<br/>Z - shoot;<br/>Bombs are not implemented, sorry ='(</p>\n<p>I'll appreciate any feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:30:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f16ed82dabf3a17f04d4b49f4a297518.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["zergon321"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
