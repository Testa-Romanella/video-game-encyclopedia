In the crash, most of the technology that served them got lost. <strong>Your goal</strong> is to help them restore their culture and reconnect with their homeworld by <strong>building a great wonder</strong>, establishing a thriving, multi-lunar space-faring society.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n<p>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n<p>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTo achieve this, you'll need to <strong>collect basic materials</strong> to <strong>build towns</strong> that provide shelter for your people. You must also <strong>collect resources</strong> and <strong>transform</strong> them to meet your citizens' basic needs as well as their most luxurious whims. As you progress, you'll need to balance the use of workers to <strong>create a robust and efficient economy</strong> and carefully lay an effective transporter network.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\nDevelop Technologies and Expand Empire\n<p>\n<br/>\nAs you work towards building the wonder, you'll need to <strong>develop new technologies</strong> to uncover the secrets of <strong>space travel</strong>. You'll also need to <strong>expand your empire</strong> in a <strong>real-time simulated planetary system</strong> by creating new colonies to exploit the materials discovered by your high-level citizens. With <strong>efficient trade routes</strong>, you can send resources to the most needy locations.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\nManage Energy and Balance Environmental Preservation\n<p>\n<br/>\nAs you lead the Axonauts towards greatness, you'll need to <strong>manage a flexible energy system</strong> that gives you increased control over your production chains. This system will challenge you to <strong>rethink your colony layouts</strong> and make strategic decisions that will have long-term impacts on your civilization. Balancing the use of energy sources will be key to maintaining supply for your people.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBut with growth comes <strong>responsibility</strong>. As your civilization expands, you'll need to keep an eye on the <strong>dynamic pollution system</strong> that affects your colony's environment. Balancing your civilization's growth with <strong>environmental preservation</strong> will be a constant challenge. As you strive for a balance, you'll face aesthetic and gameplay challenges, as well as the need to address environmental concerns.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\nExploit Asteroid Resources Using Robots\n<p>\n<br/>\nIn the end game, you'll have the opportunity to <strong>exploit the resources of asteroids</strong> using robots. These <strong>robots are completely made through production chains</strong> and will allow you to collect valuable resources from space. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and you'll need to manage these resources carefully to ensure the long-term survival of your civilization.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all of these features, <strong>the fate of the Axonauts rests in your hands</strong>. Will you be able to build a thriving civilization that can overcome the challenges of space and achieve greatness?
