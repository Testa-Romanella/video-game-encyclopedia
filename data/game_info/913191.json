Perfect for all fans of indie games and shooters.<br/>\r\nAlthough the game is an independent game made by individuals, the relevant functions are complete, and the use of facial capture technology, as well as the powerful support of Metahuman and Unreal Engine for the performance, make the CG of the game even better.<br/>\r\ngame background<br/>\r\nThe background of this work takes place in the near future.
