Two small spaceships face each other in duel. You both have the possibility to shoot two types of bullets: blue and red. Like electric charges, same colors repel each other, different colors attract. You can also keep the fire button pressed for longer to load the bullets and have them be heavier, but carry more charge. Be mesmerized by their deadly dance - use them to attack and deflect the opponent's blows, design devilish trick shots, or simply let everything degenerate into chaos. Dogfights have never been this twisty!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><em>Player 1</em></p>\n<p>W/S (or joystick 1 left stick) to move up and down</p>\n<p>C/V (or joystick 1 left and right triggers) to fire<br/></p>\n<p><em>Player 2<br/></em></p>\n<p>Up/Down (or joystick 2 left stick) to move up and down</p>\n<p>N/M (or joystick 2 left and right triggers) to fire<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the developer does not assume any responsibility for game equipment and/or friendships broken as a consequence of playing this game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:09:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d35/d355470a6c2bdd07b15afbf84bed7b76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gan_HOPE326"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
