Have you ever wondered what is the story behind it? Many many years ago there was a young gnome named Blueberry. He had a big heart and a brave soul. He feared only one thing - boredom. That's why Blueberry hated winter. 'Where are adventures?' - he would ask - 'You only sit around and do nothing! ' One winter day he went on a journey and found the deepest cave underneath the highest mountain. There, on a huge, moss-covered stone, sit Father Time spinning the thread of life. 'Get rid of all winter days from my life!' Blueberry demanded. 'Are you sure young gnome?' 'I am sure' yelled the Blueberry. 'May it be as you wish' said Father time and one by one little piece of a thread started to float in the air. Suddenly, a gush of wind blew right through the cave and took all of them - and Blubbery too. He woke up in his own bed on a beautiful spring morning. He enjoyed his life for some time - all the warm days filled with play and adventure, but after a while, he started feeling sadness.<p>All his friends spend winters together, telling stories and sitting around the fire. It got even worse when he got married to a beautiful gnome lady. They worked and played but never had time to just be with each other. The little baby gnome appeared soon after and Blueberry started feeling like his time flew. His baby boy grew so fast! He just wanted to stop the time now. Oh, how he missed the winter days! Finally, he took all the courage he had and went back to the deepest cave underneath the highest mountain. There, on a huge, moss-covered stone, sit Father Time spinning a thread of life. 'I was wrong' Blueberry cried 'How can I rebuild my priceless time?' Father time noded his sadly. 'Have you ever seen a thin white thread floating in the air on a late summer day? Each one is one of your lost winter days. Bring them back to me so you can get back what you lost.'<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T07:59:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf1/bf1ff1f7d0e2f4ed011621384665f54c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Long Bearded"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
