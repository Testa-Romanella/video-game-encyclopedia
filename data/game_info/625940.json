{"id": 625940, "slug": "wild-boar-management-simulator", "name": "Wild Boar Management Simulator", "name_original": "Wild Boar Management Simulator", "description": "<p>The player has to steer the distribution of wild boar across the landscape away from possible conflict areas (farmers or busy roads) towards areas where their positive impacts are wanted such as forests. This can be done by doing certain actions which influence the wild boar population. The player can control the food sources of the wild boar and thus control where they will go as they are attracted to places with food. These actions cost money and the player will have a limited budget with which they can purchase those actions. There is a time period in which the simulation runs and the player can skip to the next year by pressing a button. On every turn the player gets funded and receives a certain amount of money.</p>\n<p>The game world is represented by a map which consists of different terrain type tiles each with different functions. Each tile has properties such as food, attractiveness, likelihood of spawning a boar, chance of boar death. On a tile there could be a wild boar population and on every turn it will change because the boars have migrated to a new tile or have disappeared. The terrain will change through time (with every new turn) when for example a forest or crops are seeded and they grow so the tile will change. There will be tiles with roads which connect different towns and buildings such as farms. On the roads the player can build an ecoduct to allow safe passage of the wild boar.</p><p>For a better experience, please download the executable version of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:06:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4b/a4b6fc76021b733de99e92a7f1645ca1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["kaloyanmad"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
