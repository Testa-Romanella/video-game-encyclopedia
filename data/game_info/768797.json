It is a conversion for the Amiga of the C64 game \"MrRobot and his factory\".\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Programming is done in C and live on\u00a0stream at Twitch.tv.\u00a0 \u00a0If you are interested in how to realize such a game with C on the Amiga then just follow his Twitch channel!</p>\n<p>Virtual Dimension auf Twitch</p>\n<p>And that's why I wrote this editor to create levels for the upcoming game and just generate a suitable C code that can be easily integrated.\u00a0 \u00a0Just click on <strong>Run Game</strong> in the picture above to start the editor.</p>\n\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>The editor starts in <strong>EDIT mode</strong>, which is the area where you can build your level. At the bottom of the screen you will find the components of a level.\u00a0 These can be clicked with the left mouse button and placed in the upper area also with the left mouse button.\u00a0 \u00a0You can delete individual parts with the right mouse button.<br/><br/>Choose the platforms in different colors or even certain parts with which the game character is moved by itself across the screen, such as roller belts.\u00a0 It is important that you also place the player and the exit.\u00a0 \u00a0The exit is a door that opens when all the pills in the floor have been collected. With this the level is finally finished.<br/><br/></p>\n\r\nTest your level:\r\n<p>When you are finished creating the level you can test it by clicking on <strong>TEST </strong>in the bottom right corner, then the game will start in game mode and you can play the game normally. Run over all the platforms and collect all the pills from the floor to unlock the door.\u00a0 If you enter the door or die then the game is over and you will back to\u00a0<strong>EDIT mode</strong>.<br/><br/>If you are happy with your level then you can click in <strong>EDIT mode</strong> on <strong>SCRIPT\u00a0</strong>then a screen opens in which you can see the C code.\u00a0 You can then copy and paste it somewhere where it can be processed further.</p>\n\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>The character can be controlled normally with the cursor keys or a joypad.\u00a0 \u00a0You can jump with the space bar, but you can't control the jump, just like in the original game. A started jump flies in the corresponding direction until the player has solid ground under his feet again.</p>\n<p>If you run over the bombs, they explode after a second, so you should not stop there.\u00a0 The treadmills move the player in the indicated direction.<br/></p>\n<p>Ladders work exactly as you would expect ladders to work, you can climb up or down them.\u00a0 \u00a0The slide down tiles cause the player to slide down them quickly.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>The player can collect shields that protect him from monsters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T09:09:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/734/734abb5df2d537e82c3637516d5b92fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JustEpyx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
