{"id": 906462, "slug": "turbostellar", "name": "Turbostellar", "name_original": "Turbostellar", "description": "<p>This is an extra-early demo of the Space Sim/RPG Turbostellar. The gameplay is <strong>extremely</strong> barebones and is really only there so there's something for you to do while you marvel (or scoff) at the technical qualities of the game's engine.</p>\n<p>That said, there is a fail state, so it's not <em>just</em> a tech-demo walking simulator. You can get shot up by the patrol bots, or kill yourself by smashing into the ground at 100m/s with the debug jetpack. <br/></p>\n<p>The intention is to one day turn this into a type of Daggerfall-In-Space kind of RPG. The space simulation elements will mostly be a background feature, while random events and quests will be driven by an underlying faction metagame.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Space to jump - hold it down to control the height of the jump</li><li>Ctrl to \"crouch\" - there's no actual crouching yet but you can press this to cancel a jump or to go downwards when using the debug jetpack.</li><li>R to reload</li><li>H to holster your currently equipped item</li><li>F to interact</li><li>C to engage the debugging jetpack - Thereafter use the movement controls to direct your movement</li><li>Tab to open the inventory/orbital map - You can also open each specifically with I and M</li><li>Escape to get to the pause menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>TIPS<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>You ignore fall damage so long as the debug jetpack is active</li><li>Number keys and scroll wheel can be used to select items from your hotbar</li><li>Items can be picked up and dropped anywhere in the GUI when the inventory is open, or in the world if you're close enough</li><li>There's nothing to actually find out in the wilderness this time around, all of the items, enemies, and NPCs are at the fast-travel locations</li></ul>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>The Windows platform layer is way less tested than the Linux version. I practically never use Windows these days so the Linux version gets all the attention. That said, the majority of the game's code is platform-agnostic so the experience should be very similar, just expect subtle bugs if playing on Windows.</li><li>Input handling is a bit screwed on Windows, often it won't properly register when you've released a key and need to press and release again for it to stick.</li><li>Alt+Enter is supposed to toggle fullscreen but it doesn't always work on Windows. Seems to be machine-specific.</li><li>Code hot-loading is still enabled in the release build for now, so the game will copy its runtime dll into the folder where it saves your settings. Just delete it after you're done playing.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T09:49:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16e/16ee60fbdbf700e56831c44b9e8bec56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["stomygame"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
