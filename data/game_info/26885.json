In<br />\nthe near future, there are two leagues with a total of 12 teams for<br />\nplayers to choose from. Pick your team and go for the championship. The<br />\ngames are held at the exclusive Cyber Egg Stadium, where the home run<br />\nzone is alarmingly small and the fair zone is unusually wide. There is<br />\neven a stop zone to stop any ball that lands there. As the game<br />\nprogresses Crackers (mines) are installed. During games, armor can be<br />\npurchased to reinforce your players. All this makes for a unique<br />\nbaseball experience. You may be a bit perplexed at first, but once you<br />\nget used to it and begin devising a strategy, you might even start<br />\nenjoying all the curveballs being thrown at you.<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
