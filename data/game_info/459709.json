Oh, that guy!</p>\n<p>We would not be able to play games without him. We wouldn't even have computers without him!</p>\n<p>Help Alan Turing fix his Turing Machine.  Build the first computer. Be our hero!</p>\n\n<p>The themes used for this game jam submissions are:</p>\n<p>- TWO (the bits are in base 2 (0 or 1, white or black)</p>\n<p>- INFINITE (There is a very small chance the machine keeps breaking. You can also avoid the goal bits and keep cycling forever)</p>\n<p>- CYCLE (Tied to the INFINITE theme, but the player also uses a bicycle in the game, so... cycle)</p>\n<p>- IMPOSSIBLE (Again, tied to the INFINITE and CYCLE themes)</p>\n<p>- ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY (Alan Turing invented the first general-purpose computer. Not quite ancient... but pretty old!)</p>\n\n<p>I have only one game uploaded to itch, which I finished last week.
