{"id": 525822, "slug": "alien-photographer", "name": "Alien Photographer", "name_original": "Alien Photographer", "description": "<p><em>Alien Photographer</em> is inspired by my experience working as a documentary filmmaker. Sometimes while filming and working so closely on a topic for so long, I become more confused than when I started. I forget what I set out to find. It makes me feel like an alien documenting a world unfamiliar to me. This game is about that feeling: when you feel alienated. For me, that feeling comes from trying to understand the limitless complexity of creating a visual record of events. Ultimately, those images fail to make much sense or give a detailed report of what had happened, because in all actuality, the world is a very absurd place. Yet, this absurdity should not be taken as cynicism, but as radical acceptance of reality. People (or aliens) I\u2019ve met along the way may pleasantly surprise me, and it makes me feel glad that I took a snapshot to remember them by. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T04:26:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb2/fb2f9664fdf28b008846f23968ae0e54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["smoore0"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
