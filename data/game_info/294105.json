{"id": 294105, "slug": "frantic-freddie-itch", "name": "Frantic Freddie (itch)", "name_original": "Frantic Freddie (itch)", "description": "<p>This game is a remake of the game \"Frantic Freddie\", originally released in 1983 for the Commodore 64. The original game was created by Kris Hatlelid and Gregor Larson, distributed by Commercial Data Systems, Ltd. Frantic Freddie was one of the first platform games ever made.</p>\n<p>Frantic Freddie is one of the very first platform games. The goal of the game is to have Freddie collect all the pots of gold on each level while avoiding all of the enemies. Optionally collect bonus items to earn more points (10,000 points earn an extra life). When all pots have been collected on a level, you will advance to the next level. What makes the game unique, is that the platforms are connected with telephone poles instead of ladders and Freddie cannot walk past a pole. He must climb up one side and down the other. Enemies however can move past the poles! There are 16 levels of increasing difficulty, featuring different enemies on each level. The earlier levels feature 3 enemies each and the later levels have 4 and 5 enemies. Enemy speed increases gradually each level. Every two levels there are interludes to give the player a short rest.</p>\n<p>The game can be played with keyboard or gamepad. See Release Notes included with the game for full description of controls, supported game controllers, game features and how to play.</p>\n<p>The game is easy to play, but very difficult to complete.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T06:20:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/012e3c333a34ae27ca7d20ce47f2ecf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vectordyne Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
