{"id": 13919, "slug": "across-the-line", "name": "Across The Line", "name_original": "Across The Line", "description": "Across the Line is an immersive virtual reality experience that combines 360\u00b0video and computer generated imaging (CGI) to put viewers in the shoes of a patient entering a health center for a safe and legal abortion. Using real audio gathered at protests, scripted scenes, and documentary footage, the film is a powerful hybrid documentary-fiction depiction of the gauntlet that many abortion providers, health center staff, and patients must walk on a typical day in America.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe experience consists of three scenes. We begin inside the health center, finding ourselves in an exam room with a young woman and a compassionate doctor. The scene fades as we travel back in time to follow the patient and her friend as they drive up to a health center lined with protesters holding graphic signs and shouting.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe final scene uses computer-generated graphics. The viewer becomes the patient and must navigate a group of intimidating protesters shouting highly offensive remarks aimed at shaming and stigmatizing the patient. The audio montage, captured from protesters across the country, anchors the viewers experience in the reality of what thousands of people across the country face during anti-abortion protests outside of health centers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e361a7826d0cc1a9a9c05e4b0ede7a69.jpg", "website": "http://www.acrossthelinevr.com/#accessing-abortion-in-america", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 113}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emblematic Group"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Emblematic Group"], "esrb_rating": null}
