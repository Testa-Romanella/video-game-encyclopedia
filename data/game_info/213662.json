{"id": 213662, "slug": "a-monsters-heart", "name": "A Monster's Heart", "name_original": "A Monster's Heart", "description": "<p>A long time ago, in a faraway land, there was a dark wizard who wished to seize\u00a0control of the kingdom, so he tried to build the strongest and meanest monster\u00a0that he could conjure, but he failed. What came to being instead is a gentle and\u00a0curious green brute whose thirst for adventure will have him cross paths with a lost little girl looking for her father in a forbidden cave wrought with danger and simple puzzles.</p>\n<p>This game was made in about 3 weeks for MinisterJay's Heroic Monsters Game Jam. The theme is to have the Monsters be the Hero, so in this game you get to play as the brute and team up with a \"puny friend\", Lynzie and make your way to her dad. The game is pretty family friendly and it contains a unique character switching mechanic and a hunger system to \"push\" exploration. Anyways, enjoy and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfa/cfaa558872679f52d3606f8cdf785cc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Onslaught Supply Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
