The higher above it you are, the more profit you generate.<br/>You can also sell at a loss to open a more profitable position later.\r\nI'd recommend getting as close to the line as you can when you do.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d0/1d080c0157cc76b91b2537174243f363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jahn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
