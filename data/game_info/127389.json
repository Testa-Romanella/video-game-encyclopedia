In my game you play as a jet-pack miner, who gets paid to mine ores, you make money by mining the ores, and can fly around in the caves you create. However the catch is that every stone block you mine costs you .25 cents! The more stone you have in the end, the worse your pay will be at the end of the timed period. You have 1 minute to dig as much as you can, the dirt and grass blocks do not hurt or help your score. You only can mine blocks within a 3 or 4 block radius around you. I hope you enjoy playing it, and give some feedback! The controls are the basic WSAD, and to mine you click with the mouse. Have fun, and I look forward to see what you have to say! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d760bf2c7ffeea2e1d986da2be07dc67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LongBrotherStudios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
