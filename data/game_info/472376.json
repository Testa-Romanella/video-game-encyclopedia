This game is still in very\u00a0early development and it is not playable right now, but it\u00a0has some things that make a tower defense game. And every bug is just added to the hoard\u00a0pestering this thrift store.</p><p>The enemies can't be destroyed and they spawn forever.\u00a0The inventory system was not\u00a0functioning, so instead of picking up salvage to build towers and arm them, you can place a single type of pre-armed tower\u00a0as much as you like. Bonus: it aims without even pointing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:25:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/259/259ddeaeb433918d4a2160472b1683f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hipreme"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
