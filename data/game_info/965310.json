In \"New Intern\" you play the role of a man who's the CEO of Hookstone Marketing Ltd, one of the nations most important marketing corporations. The game starts when a new employee, Sophie, takes a position as your intern. It's your responsibility to guide and groom Sophie to become a successful, productive asset for the company. Will you succeed?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sophie is a smart girl who just started to work for a marketing company as an intern. She is in a relatively one-sided relationship with a man who doesn't properly appreciate her. Will she find in you the mentor she needs to help her succeed professionally, or will she discover that you are truly the man of her dreams? Then again, maybe she'll fall for you so hard that she'll be willing to fulfill all of your desires, no matter how dark.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is a story-centric game that is played entirely in a text application, where the player gets to talk via texts with Sophie about her job, and occasionally some deeper, more personal topics as well. Oh, and don't forget all the nice photos and sexy selfies.<br/><br/>The game has 42 different images you can unlock and 4 different endings, based on your choices, so be sure to choose wisely.<br/><br/><strong>FETISHES</strong><br/>3DCG, Blowjob, Handjob, Vaginal Sex, Corruption, Creampie, Facial, Cheating, Stripping, Teasing, Teen (over 18), romance", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T03:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc9/dc97d6de4fa273ed6d5bf818cf93dde1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoyalCandy"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RoyalCandy"], "esrb_rating": null}
