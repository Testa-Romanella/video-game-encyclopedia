Within hours we had several people respond to it and we further organized ourselves in a discord channel. We had people from all skill levels present but we all shared the same goal, to create content for VR in order to further support the VR community. We organized into smaller teams with each team pursuing a small project. Whack a Vote is the first title to reach completion. We quickly realized that releasing a game as a group would require a legal entity backing us which meant we had to start a company. With that said we hope that this title will provide us with enough funding to establish ourselves as a legitimate company that will be solely VR focused. We understand that this title is small in scope and quirky but we did put our heart into it. If anything the project is providing us with a stepping stone for bigger and better projects to come.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ad/5ad96992deaadb168c1de64b2cad786c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 125}, "playtime": 35, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Subreality Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Exforsys"], "esrb_rating": null}
