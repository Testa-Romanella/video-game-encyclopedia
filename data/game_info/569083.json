Welcome to INVENTORY!\r\n<p>The world is vast, uncharted, and populated sparsely by other bold, curious, and mighty heroes like you! Keep your eyes sharp as you wander around, looking for the telltale markings on the hands and arms of your comrades! Call to them, over beers, games, lines or across the parlor, and when ready, talk of your adventures together! Gather loot from your escapades, remember the adventures fondly, and indoctrinate new heroes!<br/><br/>Ah! What a joy it is to wander!<br/></p>\r\nOkay but what is this?\r\n<p>INVENTORY is a viral-by-design micro-rpg meant to be played in person at parties, conventions, pub crawls and industry nights. It involves drawing on your arm (despite what your teachers used to say), keeping an eye out for other players, narrating little adventures together, and doodling for one another on a business card. It's simple! It's silly! It's inclusive!<br/><br/>When you buy this game for at least $1 you also get commercial printer-friendly versions, and granted express permission to print it yourself (I mean I won't really be able stop you, but like... be nice), or you can buy a bundle of cards from me (COMING SOON) (I have a lot of them). <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:22:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/518104959c49eb883068668f6987406f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Legendary Vermin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
