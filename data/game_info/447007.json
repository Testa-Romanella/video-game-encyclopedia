Often they only realize its importance once they start working on their theses, negatively affecting their research quality. This is in part due to using traditional textbook-and-lecture instruction, which is insufficient for 21st century digital competences. Using games to teach research methods enables situated, active learning and can increase students\u2019 motivation and understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, very few games focus on research methods.<br/>This LIFE project is a sub-project of a bigger initiative supported by HITSA.<br/>The purpose of the LIFE project is to choose specific topics from the field of research methods and suggest and develop ideas for research-related mini-games. These games can be used as standalone applications or part of the HITSA-supported adventure game (with the mini-games being quests in the bigger journey).</p>\n\n<p>Development Team:</p>\n<p>Vishnurai Maniyil<br/>Elizaveta Klevakina<br/>Andrei Bandurevski<br/>Franklin Chidera Anizoba<br/>Triin Kangur<br/>Osman Sinan Emiroglu<br/>Daniel da rocha Fr\u00f3es\u00a0<br/>Gabriel Ferreira Lopes Fran\u00e7a\u00a0Malta</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T02:25:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb5/eb539fb6ad8a13eebf94858692aa887a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["danielfroes"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
