Nathaniel Hachey))", "description": "<p>a game I had made for a game jam shortly after my family's rabbit named kaily had died due to old age. A big influence on parts of the game and some of the game's secrets was actually there because of our rabbit recently dieing. The game is just some levels like three or four that have terrain that is randomly generated. the enemies in the levels are other rabbits and foxes. You a rabbit must get to the end flag in one of the levels/areas in-order to beat the game. It's overall a pretty simple game with you just having to find your way to the flag at the final area.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:51:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73d/73d8360372ecfe66e5d23b9a5e7307b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LordBreakerX"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
