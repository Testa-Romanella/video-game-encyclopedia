IF YOU ARE EASILY SPOOKED, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.</strong></p>\n<p><em>CONTROLS:</em>\n</p>\n<p>PRESS SPACE TO START THE GAME!! USE BUTTONS TO OPEN AND CLOSE DOORS!! PRESS Z TO SHINE LIGHT!!\r\n</p>\n<p>THIS GAME IS BEST PLAYED WITH HEADPHONES!!!!\r\n</p>\n<p><em>STORY:</em>\n</p>\n<p>You're an unemployed loser and you're running low on cash, so your first choice of action is to try to get a job at the sketchy pizzeria that has a history of bad smells, and worst of all, minimum wage. Unfortunately you're contracted to work for 6 years without stopping once, so that's about 2,190 work days. Also the animatronic characters are crazy, but I don't think you'll have to worry about that.  Actually the only thing you'll really have to worry about is the power routing. Sometimes the doors will close weirdly, but then again, why would you even need to close the doors? Think you can handle $2 dollars an hour? Let's find out.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>CONTROLS:</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hover your mouse on the left and right edges of the screen to move the camera.\r\n</p>\n<p>Click buttons to close doors.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hold \"Z\" to shine the flashlight.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>GUIDE:</em>\n</p>\n<p>Lucor: The most aggressive one, goes straight for your middle window constantly. When you see him, close the door for a few seconds until you hear footsteps.\r\n</p>\n<p>Max: Almost never appears. When you see him, close the door quickly and wait. When he leaves the sound is almost inaudible.\r\n</p>\n<p>Woogis: Appears at the left door only. Takes the longest to leave.\r\n</p>\n<p>#fangame\u00a0#fnaf\u00a0#horror\u00a0#survival</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T10:50:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a48/a488ca974fcb317ccc1f364e634707e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thewoogie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
