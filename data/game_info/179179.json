It is based on the theme of \"30 seconds\". In this case, you have \"30 seconds\" to complete each level. The game is a platformer 3D where blocks with different color do different things. Red sends you to the beginning of the level. Blue makes you jump higher if you jump on them. Yellow falls when you step on it. And Green makes you complete the level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5b/c5b57ad6ea0a96e6e647281b023011f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Janikus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
