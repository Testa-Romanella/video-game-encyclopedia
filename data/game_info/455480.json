Power Orbs are a very valuable resource and they sell for a pretty penny. They also power the life support system that allows Sadie Cat to traverse the secret cavern. Only when the life support system is full do any excess Power Orbs get sent to the surface.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Game A</strong> - randomized map</li><li><strong>Game B</strong> - daily map</li><li><strong>Retry</strong> - retry the current map</li><li><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> - Move Sadie Cat through the cavern</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You start the level with 5 Power Orbs. The life support system has a max capacity of 10 Power Orbs.</li><li>Any Power Orbs collected once the life support system is maxed equates to points. So if you have 9/10 fuel and you collect 3 Power Orbs, that is worth 2 points (12 - 10 = 2).</li><li>Skulls represent traps and hardships in the cavern. They subtract from the life support system. If the life support system reaches 0, the game is over.</li><li>You can only get your final score when all Power Orbs are collected.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T05:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/5213b9d34ba28e8c085551b7418aa626.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Alexander Shen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
