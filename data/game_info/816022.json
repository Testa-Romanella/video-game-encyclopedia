I wanted to make a magic trick simulator, with a layer of indirect learning to it. The gimmick here is a little under-developed, and\u00a0I don't think the gimmick is really suitable for anything more than a quick game.\u00a0Eh, you might like it, but I imagine most players will not respond well to how obtuse this game is.\u00a0C'est la vie.</p>\n<p>I wanted to include at least five tricks. I was sad to miss out a few more complex cards tricks, or a classic like cup and balls, or three card monte. I also wanted to include music, sound effects, better card graphics... that's game jams for you,\u00a0I suppose.</p>\n<p>Mouse and keyboard controls.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T10:03:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f14bfe1d5ae0732a880cc875f80334c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Portponky"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
