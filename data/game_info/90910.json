Didn't expect anyone to play it outside of the little jam I made it for. Thanks. </p>\r\nFor anyone interested, I'm making Nighttime Visitor anew. \r\n<p>Nighttime Visitor was made in a few weeks. I like the idea, it seems others do too, but it's far from being something really good. So I'm taking the premise and spending a lot of time to make something new with it. I wouldn't exactly call the new game a \"remake\", I think it would fall into \"reimagining\" territory. You could consider <em>this</em> game a proof-of-concept for the new game, or something. Anyway, follow development of it at my blog here:<br/></p>\r\nhttps://raincoil.tumblr.com/\r\n\n<p><strong>Update, June 10:</strong><br/>After a long time, I've fixed a few more miscellaneous problems. Alex's AI has also been improved and altered a bit, and I've finally optimized the game a lot. It should run way smoother for those who experienced lag, and at the same time also look slightly better.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, Nov 4:</strong><br/>I fixed a few little miscellaneous problems, and one big one concerning Alex's AI. Unluckily, I had never noticed this myself until I saw other people play and experience it. Logically, the code worked correctly most of the time, however I didn't take into account the order it was executed, and under particular circumstances Alex wouldn't work correctly. But now he should be a bit more competent and consistent after I've made the fix. For that, the game will probably be harder too.</p>\n<p>Performance has also been improved a bit, hopefully.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/437/4370d850480e759369514924f0ca1d4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["raincoil"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
