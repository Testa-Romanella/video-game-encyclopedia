Our leaders have chosen submission over annihilation.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here in the U.S. all states have been segregated into districts and bordered off by massive walls and terrain. Each district designed as a utopia of peace and\u00a0governed by a Community Leader and each state by a Council that answers to the alien\u00a0beings.</p>\n<p>Many have conceded to this harmonious way of life, conforming or becoming indoctrinated and given purpose of duty,\u00a0enforcing the new law.</p>\n<p>Fewer have faith in the invader's benevolence. Instead believing \"They\" are\u00a0concealing\u00a0a more sinister plan through a\u00a0ruse of security and benefactions.\u00a0These few are the rebels continuing the fight against domination,\u00a0but at what cost?</p>\n<p>Waking up alone in a frozen tundra, Tom must find the six beacons that will open a gate that leads outside the borders of his district. His goal is to\u00a0reunite with his family. That is, if they survived.</p>\n<p>From the Creator to the Audience:<br/></p>\n<p>\"This is somewhat how I would describe a full fletched out game, but this is not that... this game is a prototype for an idea. This\u00a0is\u00a0my first attempt and is an artistic approach. Since I am a novice solo developer,\u00a0I obviously have over-used and under-utilized many tools and techniques that should be used for game development, which is why I look forward to any insight, suggestions, and help to push this project forward.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you to all the artists whose work I used in the development of this game and to all those who\u00a0play it. I am certainly not discouraging donations. All forms of encouragement are welcomed and appreciated.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T05:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83f/83fddac5f3ceb7181248dac65157fd7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KoopHaussgames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
