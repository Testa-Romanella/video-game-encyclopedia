Well I remade it because I was told to. So here it is, the basic game is much the original but I'm going to add to it regularly because I want to make it more interesting. So if you stick around, thanks a bunch and you probably won't feel the need to donate to me and that's just fine. I drew all my art for this so it looks kinda bad in that regard. I have included copies of all the unity scripts I wrote for this game so feel free to take a look at them. Have fun, feel free to criticize and kill them damn UFO's!</p>\n<p>~Robley</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:40:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5ef253758954a2b5f0fe08baa230afb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robley Evans"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
