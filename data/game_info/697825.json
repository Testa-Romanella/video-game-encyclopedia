But the attraction of the theme of this time\u2019s competition, more or less, evokes all of our reflection upon the history and culture around us, as we are scattered over across the world, in China, Italy, Boston and etc. Facing a rather short amount of time given to complete an immaculate game in our heart, we finally decided to dismiss the thought of introducing the cultural relics of all the different places where we study and live, but combing our unanimous appeal in response to relics protection by creating a fictional art piece (a painting) and a history-based adventure of its \u201clife\u201d. The game, then, focuses not mainly on the playability, but on the narration of a rich-in-humanistic-care journey on which the painting we create takes.</p>\n<p>Throughout the four stages in the game, the player will join different characters in each stage, from the turbulent ancient era to the mythological future world, to decide what kind of destiny the painting will receive. And be cautious of any decision you make and every movement you take \u2014 it may be counter-intuitive to the imagined result as you expect, because we believe that instead of absolutely reasonability in logistic level, chance and contingency in the turbulent history is an as important element that bestows the fate to a piece of art.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T05:01:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d5/5d55d323642819d58d30bf2a0c111cbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gary_Kong"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
