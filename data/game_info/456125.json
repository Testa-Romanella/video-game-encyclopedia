This is my first successful project on unity. It was inspired by my struggle to learn spanish, and will to do it. It still needs some polishing to do, so wait for updates!</p>\n\n<p>In this game, I decided to tackle how to tell time in spanish because it is an easy skill to gamify. You will need to enter how it would be said as per instructions on the side to learn it. I took inspo from quizlet, but in a much more simplistic way.</p>\n\n<p>I learned how to make animations in unity and wrote 2 out of 4 scripts needed to run it. The other 2 scripts wrote my amazing\u00a0friend\u00a0Retropaint, who also helped me learn the new framework. So thank you very much!</p>\n<p>And here are some screenshots from the game dev process too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:26:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8db8197830558c176309394a8f0ae1cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["chara_jay"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
