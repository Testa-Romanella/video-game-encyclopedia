About love as fuel, the force that drives us.<br />\nLove is a universal feeling, but each of us experiences it in a different way. Solo \u2013 Islands of the Heart explores the theme of love in an introspective way, allowing players to identify and reflect on their own experiences.<br />\nThe world is divided into archipelagos, with each island representing a unique puzzle. Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.<br />\nAs with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island.<br />\nNature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-19T18:34:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c93/c93f41e42b350075651f615532d8e313.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 10, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 41, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Team Gotham"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Merge Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
