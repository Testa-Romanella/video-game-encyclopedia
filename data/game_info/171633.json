Waking up in the Southern Desert village of\r\nCorinth, our hero is a young boy named Joshua who dreams of escaping\r\nthe poverty of his hardscrabble life. And today, he's going to get\r\nhis chance...</p>\n<p>\r\n       The\r\ngreat pride and treasure of the people of Rionon is the <strong>Stone\r\nStatue,</strong>\r\na relic from ages past both revered and worshiped by the citizens who\r\nbelieve it brings good fortune. The Statue sits reverently, it's\r\nwatchful eyes of marble gazing out from in front of Priesas Turtas,\r\nthe palatial home of the High Priest of Rionon in the opulent capital\r\ncity of Urusalim.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tFor Rionon is a land of haves, and have nots, and you,\r\nyoung Joshua, are most certainly a have not. The down and out\r\nvillagers of Corinth know not to try and rub elbows with the\r\nresidents of Urusalim, save for perhaps those souls living in the\r\ncapital's tenements neighborhood. The response of the people in the\r\ncultural hub of Laodicea, just north of your little hamlet, are\r\nbarely different.</p>\n<p><strong>But\r\nperhaps all of that is about to change...</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tIn what can only be described as a brazen move, one\r\nnight the Statue went missing. The priests and soldiers searched far\r\nand wide, but to no avail. A pall fell over the nation as people lost\r\nall hope. And that's when the letters came. The priests, in a\r\ndesperate attempt to find the Statue through any means possible have\r\nresorted to coming to your village looking for anyone who might be\r\nable bodied enough to search high and low for the Statue. The only\r\nlead they have to go on is a suspicion that a known cult, Pax\r\nChristi, is behind the disappearance. Find the Statue, and you will\r\nbe showered with wealth beyond compare. Indeed, your entire village\r\nwould finally gain the respect it deserves, and you? The admiration\r\nof the entire country. It's time to hunt down this dirty cult. But\r\nwhy would they even steal the Statue?</p>\n<p><strong>Inspired by the Bible. </strong></p>\n\n<p>Delving into issues of morality and choice, Rionon is inspired by the book of Acts in the New Testament, and features a large open world with dozens of characters.
