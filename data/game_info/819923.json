Utilize your \"ghost\" dice to plan out your moves first and then execute with the <strong>E </strong>key.\u00a0\u00a0Don't like your original plan? Undo it with the <strong>Q</strong> key.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you find yourself in range, it is time for battle. Use your remaining Action Points to unleash your fury on the enemy dice you just tracked down. Cause mayhem with a variety of attacks that give you different options: from striking a single enemy, multiple enemies, or sniping a stray goblin. Once you have them in your sights press the\u00a0<strong>E</strong> key again to bathe in the blood of your enemies.</p>\n<p>Once your rage has been satisfied press the\u00a0<strong>P</strong> key to end your turn.</p>\n<p>Win or Lose, there are always more dice to destroy. Use the\u00a0<strong>R</strong> key to terrorize the enemies again in your current stage or use the\u00a0<strong>C</strong> key to move on and find a more worthy foe. The choice is yours mighty warrior!</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. Unfortunately, WebGL has put up quite a fight and our final two levels had to be cut down in order for it to run. However, we will also provide a Windows OS and MacOS build that does work in its entirety. Trust us, you are gonna want to fight the hordes in the original last two levels.</p>\n<p>2. There\u00a0 are still some unresolved errors that can occur when players take certain actions next to enemies or obstacles.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Things</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Although they are not really bugs there are a few quality of life things that we did not get around too:</p>\n<p>1. To complete a level you <strong>MUST</strong> press the<strong> P</strong> key to end your turn. This will trigger the victory condition.<br/></p>\n<p>2. Level loading can be a little slow, and sometime requires a second <strong>R</strong> or <strong>C</strong> key press. The game is working, but could still use some optimizing.</p>\n<p><strong>Contributors:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Michael Parr -\u00a0parrtaygaming.itch.io</p>\n<p>Nitekrwlr.itch.io</p>\n<p>Matt Evans - cmdr0.itch.io<br/></p>\n<p>gr1fty.itch.io</p>\n<p>illusivebyte.itch.io</p>\n<p>draco_ranger.itch.io</p>\n<p>bluefoot.itch.io</p>\n<p>korivain.itch.io<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T21:18:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30c/30ce45868abeb3eafd16d7ba0e76ef41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ParrTay Gaming", "cmdr0", "illusivebyte", "Nitekrwlr", "Korivain", "bluefoot", "gr1fty", "draco_ranger"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
