It is a game that you can try to beat while you render your video, waiting for the meeting or for a reply from your friend.<br/>Besides the solo-hardcore experience, 11th Dream delivers fully scrip-table in-game map editor, daily scoreboards to compete with other players and full on-line stats and leader-boards. <br/><br/>To bring vapor of dream gaming to your screen, we are going through rather bizarre development flow using our own custom engine. Absence of accessible technology supports our imagination, breaking visuals and also drives us to create new artistic approaches to fast 3D shooter genre.<br/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Single-Player Story Campaign<br/></li><li>Fast Paced Hardcore Game-play<br/></li><li>Arena Skirmish Maps<br/></li><li>In-Game Level Editor<br/></li><li>Daily (TBD) and scoreboards</li></ul><br/>\u201cYou should add photosensitivity warning!\u201d<br/> <strong>-J.
