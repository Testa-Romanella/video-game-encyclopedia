{"id": 664959, "slug": "tomb-rumble", "name": "Tomb Rumble", "name_original": "Tomb Rumble", "description": "<strong>Tomb Rumble</strong> is a pixel art MMO platformer, where adventurers compete to retrieve ancient treasures in lost temples, cursed ruins and more. <strong>Push other players into deadly traps to be the first to escape !</strong>... or be the one to fall in a lava pit.<br/><br/>The game takes form in a succession of small, <strong>fast-paced maps</strong> full of action. Short time limit, lava rising, giant boulders falling, and cruel other adventurers. Your goal is to reach the escape rope of each temple, by jumping and running your way through while collecting coins and getting the occasional obligatory gem. <br/><br/>To do so, a nice little <strong>arsenal of items and environmental traps</strong> to block and get rid of other players is at your disposal. As well as a bunch of<strong> special skills and buffs</strong> to help you stay alive like invisibility, double jumps or quick dash. Use everything you got strategically to clear your way to victory.<h3>History is written by the smartest</h3><br/><br/>While you could just team up with other explorers and all share the treasures, you could also\u2026 trigger a deadly spike , unleash a giant scythe or activate a deadly saw blade. Each level got its own set of traps, randomly assigned to players, that you can use at your advantage to get rid of other players! Or you can... just push them off the ledge right before the end.<h3>Hundreds of levels and an infinity of possibilities </h3><br/><br/>More than hundreds of levels of all kinds are waiting for you, ranging from classical tombs full of traps and puzzle jumps in the jungle, to trips into unstable volcanoes.<h3>Be the mastermind behind those tricky temples</h3><br/><br/>Design, share and play your own maps with other adventurers. Using our 2D physics engine, you will be able to quickly build a tomb for your fellows using ready-made assets, placing traps and tweaking the physics and behavior of each part of your level!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T03:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e7b3c05ce6a616fa8e60d035c01d5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 123}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Atelier 801"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Atelier 801"], "esrb_rating": null}
