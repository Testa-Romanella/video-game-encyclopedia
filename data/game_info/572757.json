You're stranded in a crater the size of Novac - many , many years after the legendary Courier Six wandered the Mojave Wasteland. Curiously, many of Novac's famed locations and haunts are to be found in the crater too. Thus, the name: <em>Fallout: Marooned In Novac .</em><br/></p>\n<p>This game is a submission for RETRO JAM: 2021\u00a0. The original New Vegas was 3rd gen and I decided to retrofit it for PSX/PS1 in design and graphics. My implementation of the theme \"Side Effects\" is nonexistent but I really can't say what happened for this stranger to end up in such a creepy crater.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>w,s,a,d / move</li><li>space bar / jump</li></ul>\n<p><strong>BONUS\u00a0~Katamari\u00a0Mode~</strong></p>\n<p>Revisit the map and become the void you're destined to be in a very loose spin of <em>Katamari Damacy</em> gameplay.
