Trinity Dungeon is a game of tactics and positioning in a procedurally generated dungeon, where each new game is fresh and interesting. Each level provides its own unique set of challenges and monsters, and yields different loot every time. Every fourth level contains a powerful boss who is a tough obstacle to any party.
