Simple and clear. My teacher decided to give an example then. He said: \"You can make whatever you want, even a game in which hippo dodges logs\".\u00a0<br/>In that moment I decided to make exactly this game to troll him (definitely not because of lack of imagination).</p>\n<p>All those years later, I present to you a remake of this game:\u00a0<strong>Happy Hippo</strong>!<br/>Now with menus, music and even online leaderboard! So, go and beat my record (it's not that hard).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Technical:</strong><br/>This game is made using Godot Engine<br/>Music from timbeek.com<br/>Leaderboard is implemented using SilentWolf backend</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T10:08:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cd/1cdea984e8d647d6b96f548cc2a8ff84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["vladocc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
