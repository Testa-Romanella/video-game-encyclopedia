I\u00a0have been toying with the idea of learning Unity for a while, and this gave me as good a reason as any to start! And so we created \"Hide and Seek\" - a medieval era stealth game involving spiders and treasure!</p>\n\r\nGiant spiders... check!\r\n\r\nTreasure... check!\r\n\r\nThe goal is simple:\r\nFind the treasure in each level and return home... ALIVE!\r\n<p>Players are scored at the end of each level, based on the number of times they were killed, and how long they took to complete the level. The score is tallied at the end of the game, with an objective to beat the level and game high scores.</p>\n\r\nEnd of level scoring\r\n\n<p>We've spent a good few months on building out games systems, as well as a good few quid buying up assets on sale on the Unity Asset Store, and we present to you our game. We are not professional games developers or graphic artists or sound technicians, so please be gentle!</p>Controls\r\n<ul><li>Move Player - W, A, S, D or left stick</li><li>Move Camera - mouse or right stick</li><li>Action / Open Door - E or A button</li><li>Jump - space or X button</li><li>Roll - Q or B button</li><li>Sneak - C or Y button</li><li>Equip Torch - Right Arrow</li><li>Sprint - shift or press left stick</li><li>Esc - pause the game</li></ul>Current features:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Biome based levels</strong> - \"Snow Mountain\", \"Forest\", \"Desert\", \"Beach\"</li><li><strong>Active weather</strong> - storm, rain, snow, wind, clouds</li><li><strong>Day / night cycle - </strong>stars, moon, real-time option</li><li><strong>Health and stamina</strong> - sprinting and jumping</li><li><strong>Swimming </strong>- at the expense of health/piranhas!</li><li><strong>Character selection</strong> - choice of male and female main characters</li><li><strong>Minimap </strong>plotting enemy locations</li><li><strong>Buildings</strong> - explorable interiors, active lighting, opening doors</li><li><strong>Spiders </strong>- lots of spiders!</li><li><strong>Animal AIs</strong> - deer, rabbit, stag, bear, pig, chicken</li><li><strong>Basic NPCs</strong> - wandering and static humanoid characters</li><li><strong>AI factions</strong> - watch the spiders fight and kill their prey!</li><li><strong>Respawn on death</strong> - no \"game over\" screen</li><li><strong>Blood splatter</strong> - some lovely decals and volumetric effects</li><li><strong>Screen and audio configuration</strong> - performance tuning and preferences</li></ul>\r\nWhat we have planned:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Populated, living and breathing levels</strong></li><li><strong>Defence/attack</strong>\u00a0- engage with\u00a0enemies</li><li><strong>Paths and rivers</strong> - safe travel versus risk versus time</li><li><strong>More engaging gameplay -</strong>\u00a0seeking the location of the treasure</li><li><strong>Quests and dialogue</strong> - actively opening up routes to succeed</li><li><strong>Lots and lots and lots more!</strong></li></ul>\n<p>We welcome suggestions, comments and constructive feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T09:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc1/bc13f422ac9909a832f15518a3f3a1e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daftapplegames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
