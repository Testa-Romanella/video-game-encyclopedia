Most of the features are currently implemented and shown in this demo. The goal of the game is to collect all the Star Shards and beat 4 bosses to face the final boss! The demo consists of a working Co-op mode {Not entirely finished but functional!}, 5 rooms to try out stuff, and a boss! If you're playing Solo, you can choose to play as either Crimson or Azure, while in Co-op mode you'll play as both!</p><p>Default keyboard controls are:</p><p>X, C, arrow keys. </p><p>If two players are using the keyboard, it becomes:</p><p>Player 1: O,P, Arrow Keys</p><p>Player 2: F, G, WASD.</p><p>The game will auto-detect XBox360 type controllers and use those instead. I can't garanatee it will work with more then one controller or any other kind of controller, sorry!</p><p>Please leave a comment if you find any bugs/problems or what you enjoyed/didn't, if you'd like!!! Thank you for your time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4c/d4c9505c1ba589a1dfeaaa54dd157e04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rivit"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
