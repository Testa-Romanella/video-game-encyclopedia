So, naturally, it's not going to be great. In fact, I know it's not great: it's still too large after trimming down files, I could only host one file on this page so the Windows version is elsewhere, and the load times are garbage.)</p>\n<p>(But do you know what? I finished it. And for that much, I'm happy. Thank you for the experience, and I can't wait to improve and do something considerably better for next year.)</p>\n<p>(You play as Elizabeth, a college student in the 1960s who's troubled by weird dreams.\u00a0There are three effects, a few\u00a0\u00a0mostly-story-related events, and a few other things to collect. There are three overworlds, seven side worlds, and only two endings.\u00a0Please let me know if the game isn't working. It worked fine on my desktop, but I can see it running into issues elsewhere.)</p>\n<p>(I'll be back to upload a windows version later, possibly in a different game page altogether.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d4/8d44c8035adfa9ab9189ca8c72e3dd29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Strung Up Starlight"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
