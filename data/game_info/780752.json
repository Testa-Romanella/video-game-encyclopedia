His only chance of survival is to find a way to a space shuttle and escape the station without getting caught by the monster.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>But because everything went wrong so fast, all the shuttles are not ready to go so the protagonist will need to find different objects and tools in order to leave.<br/><br/><strong>Searching for items</strong><br/>There are plenty of places where items can be found, including drawers, tables, cabinets, beds, and inside the tunnels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Try not to get lost</strong><br/>The spaceship is almost like a maze. You can find maps in the tunnels close to the stairs. Let's hope you have a good spatial orientation.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Minimum system requirements</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br/>\n</li><li>OS:\u00a0Windows 10<br/>\n</li><li>Processor:\u00a0Intel Core i5-10600K 4.10GHz<br/>\n</li><li>Memory:\u00a08 GB RAM<br/>\n</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0GeForce GTX 1650<br/>\n</li><li>DirectX:\u00a0Version 12<br/>\n</li><li>Storage:\u00a01 GB available space\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T13:31:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e1/2e199e2feab43a78bbd687cb9b55819a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucy's Playground"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
