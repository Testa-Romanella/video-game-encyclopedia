{"id": 124201, "slug": "sea-monster-x", "name": "Sea Monster X", "name_original": "Sea Monster X", "description": "<p>Sea Monster X is a decades-old previously unreleased adventure game for the NEWTRON 3652,\u00a0a forgotten video game system released in extremely limited quantities in - of all places -\u00a0Saskatchewan, Canada. In fact, the game was believed to be lost, before we discovered a crate of copies in a forgotten storage facility outside of Carrizozo,\u00a0New Mexico. The copies had been earmarked for a store in Saskatchewan. The order was cancelled when the NEWTRON 3652 was pulled from shelves following a disappointing retail performance on Boxing Day, and that was that for Sea Monster X until our detectives uncovered the trove.</p>\n<p>Experts warned us that porting Sea Monster X to a modern platform would be an immensely difficult task given the complexity of the code and the poor condition of the game disks.\u00a0But we were undeterred and ported the game in record time, utilizing only 5,465 man-hours. Thanks to us, Sea Monster X is now available on PC for the enjoyment of intrepid gamers the world round.\u00a0We even made a few updates to the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But why... why did we care so much about Sea Monster X? Anybody that played the demo that was released in select Regina,\u00a0Saskatchewan bars back in the 1980s can tell you why: It's a funny, one-of-a-kind game with an endearing story. The graphics were truly unparalleled for the time period, a forerunner to the popular pixel art style employed in many modern games. And the soundtrack - now remastered in glorious\u00a0HD - \u00a0is a real toe-tapper.</p>\n<p>What are you waiting for? It's free... unless you <em>want </em>to pay for it. Experience a supernatural beach town and find out what you're made of. Interact with dolphins and discover buried treasure.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af8/af8e1b6b6ef2b72e49b56066b2c780cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["georgemonster"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
