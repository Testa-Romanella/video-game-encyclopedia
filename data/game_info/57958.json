This game takes place on the Continent of Eptina where numerous battles have taken place over territory, goods, and beliefs. In the midst of the conflict archaeologists in the Pharastia Kingdom discovered giant armored mecha that they called ATACs, or All Terrain Armored Combatants, that could be controlled by the thoughts of the pilot seated inside the unit&#39;s head. The Kingdom used the power of these ATACs to assume control of the entire continent, and then decided to use them to keep the peace in their new territories. Pharastia soon began to lose control as Coup d&#39;etats and civil wars erupted which left it in a defeated state, with only their standing army remaining.</p>", "metacritic": 62, "released": "1998-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T15:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/806/806f1ee2e5a7f30be6f3ac19abf5ed09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.2, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["S-NEO"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Working Designs"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
