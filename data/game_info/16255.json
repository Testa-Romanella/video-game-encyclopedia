It is the second installment in the self-titled series, preceded by Edna &amp; Harvey: The Breakout released three years prior \u2014 in 2008.<br />\nBoth games&#39; setting is the 2D comic world. The game design feature of the game is an absence of bars with the actions, usually to the genre. Gameplay only allows speaking with the other characters, choosing the corresponding emotional reaction (much like a dialogue wheel in Mass Effect series) and connect objects within the inventory. <br />\nThe story follows Lilli \u2014 the protagonist of the game. The setting is the female school in some Abbey. After the news of a probable brainwash, the main character and some other pupils decide to expose corrupted school officials. The story, like this, tracks themes of a problematic youth, father-and-son issues, and adolescent disobedience. The game features three endings: the player is free to choose any one with their choices not affecting the outcome.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2011-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-10T00:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8be747402ff458ca85fcca3038cd21c_8t0MBsj.jpg", "website": "http://www.harveysneueaugen.de/", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 123, "owned": 1819, "beaten": 88, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 25, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 136, "suggestions_count": 496, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 136, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS", "PC", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
