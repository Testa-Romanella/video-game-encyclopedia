A Sentinel arrives from the Capitol, accusing the Professor of being the source of this unusual bad weather, and Emilia sets out to clear things up! Discover the true villain behind the mystery and take back the springtime!</p>\n<p>Emilia and the Endless Winter is a continuation of the story in \"If Jet Got a Girlfriend,\" but it can be played and fully understood with no prior knowledge. It ended up so wordy, I'm tempted to redefine it as an adventure game rather than an RPG... Sorry about that! Playtime will probably be around an hour and a half to two hours if you find and do everything. There aren't many (any?) lewd jokes this time around, but I would still prefer anybody who plays it to be 18 or older, just in case. There is some swearing and some violence. ... WAIT, THE THEME WAS SUPPOSED TO BE \"CHOSEN ONE,\" NOT \"WINTER?\" WHOOPS</p>\n<p>Made in two weeks for the second (You)\u00a0RPGM Game Jam. I hope you enjoy! Please let me know if you find any severe bugs or get stuck in any way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T08:32:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/337/337a1959a3d9c9b5c772a04adc3ec448.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["minkulus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
