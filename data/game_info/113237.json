The only way to return to the void is to travel through a series of black holes, avoiding hazards and pitfalls along the way. You must collect enough dark matter in each area to be able to warp into the black hole. You can use your special ability of levitating via a platform of dark energy to help you get home!</p>\n\n<p>For the best experience, please use a controller. The controls are very simple:</p>\n<p>Left and Right Movement: Left analog or directional pad</p>\n<p>Jump: Press A</p>\n<p>Boost: Hold A once in the air</p>\n\n\n<p>This is a game I challenged myself to finish because I kept starting new projects and abandoning them. It is a tiny game, only 3 levels! I set out to finish it in 2 weeks, which of course turned into nearly a month. It is very short and hopefully pretty sweet!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art, Scripting, and Design: Chris Evans</p>\n<p>Opening Theme: Evan Wojtala</p>\n<p>Main Theme: Chan Walrus</p>\n\n<p>Chan is gracious enough to create a ton of quality music that he makes available to anyone to use for any project.
