You must get rid of them and their unfunky ways once and for all.. and bring the funk back to the universe!</p>\n<p><em>AFROMEDA</em> is a 2D Vertical Shooter set in space. This game was made for IGMC 2015. I may work on it in the future, so you might want to come back if you like what you see! The twist was 'growth'. Our take on the twist is that when the player defeats the first boss, the boss takes the funk away from the universe. You must fight to get it back again the alien forces and with your help, the funk will grow from there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>W A S D - movement</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - primary fire</p>\n<p>SPACE - alternative fire (tip: hold for better effect!)</p>\n<p>Esc - pause game</p>\n<p>R - restart level</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lead Developer</strong>: Callum Carr</p>\n<p><strong>Music &amp; SFX:</strong> Benjamin 'Scythuz' Carr</p>\n<p><strong>Artists:</strong> Amysaurus, Hiddenone, Michael Rookard, Sherman3d, Pieterator</p>\n<p><strong>Game Engine: </strong>GameMaker Studio Professional edition created by Yoyo Games Ltd</p>\n\n<p>You can find the soundtrack to AFROMEDA here:<br/>https://soundcloud.com/scythuz/sets/afromeda</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18a/18a4ed5c3bb6697e6c3f620be10d6abe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Callum Carr"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
