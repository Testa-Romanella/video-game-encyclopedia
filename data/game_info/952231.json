You can set your own rules and just have fun. I made this game because we played it in the car but when we played it for a while we always forgot what words we have said and havent. You can type random words but you can set rules like, Only animals and objects or only names. You can choose how or with who you play</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T06:54:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d321cb790d3e7cbdfdd208551d6e9c71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Theumske"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
