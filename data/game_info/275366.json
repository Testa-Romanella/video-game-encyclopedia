This is the project I started for the Unity2D learning purposes.</p>\n<p>There are 15 levels to beat, 3 of them contain 'bosses'. You have 4 lives per each level (they do not cumulate). You can reload a current level by pressing 'R', however it will cost you some points. For more detailed information check out the 'How to play' section of the game.</p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fe/6fe122edefd848d25849b06fefc9d66a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Karo Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
