The scoring system is somewhat simple every time you beat a level you get 20 points but however many times you died during that level not from using a life but losing all lives you will have one point subtracted from those 20 you cannot earn negative points mean your points will always go up or get none from this part of the scoring system you also get points for every heart you have if you finish a level with one heart you get five points do you finish a level with two hearts you get 10 points and if you finish a level with three hearts you get 20 points!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T02:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c34d525a03deae330db06204f9ea57a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["EYDum"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
