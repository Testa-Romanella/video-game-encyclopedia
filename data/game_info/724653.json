Loot the dungeons for rare artifacts that you may use to decorate your home. Avoid deadly traps and battle foul creatures that lurk in the dark places below the Earth. Complete challenging quests to earn even greater rewards. Fill up your backpack with valuable items and find the exit room, where you must decide to either go deep... or go home!</p>\n<p>This game is in EARLY... Early Access! In other words, it's not really a fully playable game at this point. I wanted to setup a store page to start building up some hype for the game and let people know that it exists. For those of you interested, you can follow my progress as I continue working on the game day to day on Twitch. https://www.twitch.tv/almightygamesdev</p>\n<p>The game will be free-to-play as I develop the game here on itch.io. I hope you enjoy. <br/></p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Operating System:\u00a0Windows 10</li><li>Processor: Quad Core</li><li>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: GeForce</li><li>Sound Card: DirectSound-compatible</li><li>Storage: 195 MB</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T07:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07e85a040d511ef9b1d7e1b88bdc5faf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Almighty Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
