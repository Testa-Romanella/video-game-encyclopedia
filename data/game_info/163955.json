This explanation is where the simple part of the game ends because you will find a bunch of challenging levels waiting for you to prove how skillful, clever and patient you are!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe development of this game was possible thanks to the great \r\n\traylib library and some cool audio loops taken out of a song from Josh Penn-Pierson.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNow you can also choose to download a version with a simple level editor to modify the levels or create your own challenges!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNote: All levels are unlocked in this version to save your time. If you just want to play, download the version without the level editor.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHave fun and feel free to coment!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e4/5e47c27c086ef7c251212fb046de2bc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kurnic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
