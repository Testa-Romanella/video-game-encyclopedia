You explore the map from the top-down perspective.<br />\nThe galaxy layout is procedurally generated each time you start a new game. You have the freedom to explore the galaxy at your pace. The game does not force you to follow your initial task. Different planets can contain useful items or be a home for an alien race. There are several types of aliens, some of them are friendly a let you trade with them, and some are hostile and trying to attack you. The battles are real-time and require both right equipment and strategical usage of it to win. Space is filled with black holes that can destroy your ship or slow down time for you. <br />\nThe game\u2019s main feature is that it is strictly time-limited and each new playthrough takes up to half an hour. After the time is over, you either return to your home or vanish in outer space. <br />\nThe game offers three different roles for you that affect your initial mission and equipment: military ship, pirate or science ship. The military ship allows you to carry more weapons, while the science ship has a scanner that allows getting information about aliens in nearby systems from the safe distance.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2013-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T18:07:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67ed02eae8de073929c3d0809f60c65b.jpg", "website": "http://www.infinitespacegames.com/weirdworlds/", "rating": 1.66, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 55, "owned": 1201, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 38, "suggestions_count": 384, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 38, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Digital Eel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digital Eel"], "esrb_rating": null}
