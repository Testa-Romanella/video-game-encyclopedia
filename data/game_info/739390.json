You think you might be onto something. But Dr. Baggs is onto YOU.<br/></p>\n<p>There are several choices to make, but only\u00a0<strong>one</strong> ending.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Megalosomnia -\u00a0Megalommi\r\n</p>\n<p>Voice Acting (Dr. Baggs, General Papyrus)\u00a0-\u00a0Davetastic Dave\r\n</p>\n<p>Sprites, Backgrounds, Programming, Writing\u00a0-\u00a0DerpyChoCho\r\n</p>\n\r\nContent Warning Details\r\n<p>This visual novel contains moments where the player character is hypnotized and persuaded with suggestions.</p>\n<p>This VN is not suitable for those adverse to flashing lights or sudden camera movements. But there is the ability to turn off visual effects in the accessibility menu.</p>\n<p>There are moments where things can get very sensual between Dr. Baggs and the player. However, this can be avoided\u00a0by not pressing the \"Flirt\" button. In other words, the player must initiate any sensual moments so Dr. Baggs reciprocates.</p>\n<p>There is no sexually explicit content, but there are descriptions of heated making out.</p>\r\nDev Notes\r\n<p>I\u00a0don't normally delve into Undertale AUs. But\u00a0Mmi's AU gave me an idea on how\u00a0to experiment with some new mechanics in Ren'Py. So I made this super short VN to test things out! Hence the double meaning of the VN title.\u00a0\u00a0:)</p>\n<p><strong><em>Also, if you haven't seen the credits...<br/>... </em></strong><strong><em>you haven't seen everything.</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T09:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac5/ac56d6ac960a2d39c1a1519711a09646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["derpychocho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
