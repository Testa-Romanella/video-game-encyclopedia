Slimes from space are invading your garden. Guide Grandpa Ram to destroy the monsters, but - beware - he may trample you too! Survive as long as possible, or go for medals encouraging alternate play styles. The flowers need you - don't abandon them!</p>\n<p>Move with WASD or the arrow keys. Dash with shift and pause with space! The game also supports a gamepad: move with the left stick, dash with A and pause with start.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
