It starts with how it looks in some places now, green but still pretty barren. If you walk forward\u00a0then you'll see\u00a0a ash landscape after the fires. and after that its just a desert. If you take a right turn in the beginning you will see a forest as it was 100 years ago.</p>\n<p>Youtube link:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T03:33:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/0126ce9c6a3ce1dc97614752df3c693f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WantedSmile"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
