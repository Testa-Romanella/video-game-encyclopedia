He was last seen by a woozy cow at his farm (located in the lovely place of Bummertown), raking dead rats on his porch.<br/><br/><br/><em>- The red circle marks the spot where Bedford was last seen. Ignore the upside-down bird, it\u2019s not a glitch, only a photographic illusion.</em><br/><br/><br/><br/>This is what the cow had to say:<br/>\"Yeah I saw him, standing there in front of his hut raking something. When all of a sudden the usual glitch* occurred that pushed Bedford's rake out of his hands and into the sky. All I remember after that was Bedford's red face, his barrage of curses, and him walking into the woods.\"<br/><em>*We, as the developers of the wonderful Bummertown, do not agree with said statement.
