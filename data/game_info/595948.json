I'm Ethan and this is my 4th game jam. I started learning to program about a year ago. These jams have been a great way for me to finish a game and learn with the pressure of a deadline.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a simple game based on a true story about three soldiers trapped in the bottom of a sinking boat. (link to story). Obviously the exact events in the game probably didn't happen. There's not a lot of information about the details of the story.</p>\n<p>I put a lot of work into it the past couple of days so I hope you enjoy. I'll admit there's quite a bit of spaghetti code in there but hey it works.\u00a0Constructive critism and feeback in general is very welcome.</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Programming: @ethanThopkins</p>\n<p>Art: @RenderByDavid</p>\n<p>Sound:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSound effects obtained from https://www.zapsplat.com\u201c\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Nocturne No. 2 in E-flat Major\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T16:16:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/973/97319f1a7c9bf77a81e486edcc11b794.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ethanthopkins"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
