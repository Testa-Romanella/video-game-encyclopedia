In this game the goal is to be the last player standing by collecting weapons that spawn around the map and killing your opponents. The twist is that all the weapons in the game are non-functional in some way.<br/><br/>This build of the game has one level and can be played with 2-4 players. To add players press fire while on the lobby screen after hitting play. Once all players are joined hitting start will begin the game. There is a mechanism to go back to the lobby to add or remove players though this does not work as intended and in order to change connected players after starting the game the game must be restarted.<br/><br/>Finally buildings in the game have structural integrity and will collapse if there are no solid elements supporting them.<br/><br/>Oh and you can rocket jump!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T07:54:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c5/9c5b25e75264df2e6fba86ef959cac3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Telrem"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
