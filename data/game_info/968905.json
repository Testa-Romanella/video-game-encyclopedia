Take up the challenge by solving a variety of puzzles in your quest to pass the Alien IQ Exam, Phase 1. Aliens can be quirky but you should expect challenges that test many of the categories seen in human IQ exams but in fun, puzzle formats.  Puzzles will test your mathematical knowledge, visual/perceptual skills, spatial reasoning, pattern recognition and logical reasoning.  There are two levels of difficulty and ten puzzle stages.  First, figure out how to manipulate the puzzle elements, then follow clues/prompts to arrive at the solution.  Puzzles only require mouse input, however, a calculator app can be helpful in two of them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAliens always have a hidden agenda.  Can you figure out the meta-puzzle within?  Those that succeed will be rewarded with knowing they are the elite of humanity.  Good luck and prove yourself worthy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T21:54:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/699/699d0b89a21323f0469cf03448adeb67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Super RR Man Productions"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Super RR Man Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
