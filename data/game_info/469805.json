It follows Auriel, a princess betrothed to a prince she's never met. With no other children, Auriel is her kingdom's only hope of a peaceful succession to another nation when her father dies.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>The only problem for Auriel is that she is a lesbian and does not want to marry a man. Desperately in love with her lady-in-waiting, she pushes down her feelings in order to do her duty to her parents and country.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want to support the development of this game and have a direct impact of the direction, consider becoming a\u00a0patron by following this link.
