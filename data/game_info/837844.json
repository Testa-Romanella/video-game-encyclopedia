Upgrades and opponents will be randomly  picked,so every time it can(and most time)will be different.You can  charge SUPERSHOT from time to time - to go super fast.But be aware  opponents can do same to you.Also where is people talking about very  strong AI who enter a competition too,so try to make your AI a world  class ponger!\r\n    </p>\n<p>My first game jam ever and i am pretty excited! Task was not easy -  working on a game almost 2 days,and sleep like 3 hours :/ But\u00a0 glad to  make it! \r\n    </p>\n<p>Because its my first game jam, i\u00a0 decided,\u00a0 it will be based on first  major video game in history - PONG! And it also perfectly fits a theme  too ;)\r\n    So enjoy my game(or not) and leave a comment about it.Have a nice day,i'm going to bed soon...zzzzzzz</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T17:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f3e5ccfa5500eb4ed95005b51cd42e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FunZir Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
