You have a little base / outpost close to the outbreak and you are trying to survive. While exploring the area, you find the resources needed to survive. You may also find some buildings which contain valuable resources, such as schematics or other survivors. Everything seems to be going great, \u2018till it gets night. Zombies and other creatures start swarming your compound and you will need to survive the night. Hopefully your compound will hold it.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move camera\r\n</li><li>Mouse on edge of screen - Move camera\r\n</li><li>Click on minimap / drap border on minimap - Move camera\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Click on unit - Select unit (left-shift for multiple select)\r\n</li><li>Click and drag - Box selection\r\n</li><li>RMB - Move selected unit(s)\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Stand near tree / stone (with unit) - Collect resource</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>In Development</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This project is in development.
