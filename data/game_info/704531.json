If you're on hard mode, don't let 60 in.</p>\n<p>Hard mode people get a bossfight</p>\n<p>Each trash has a gimmick</p>\n<p>1.Milk Carton-Why would you throw away MILK CARTONS in a CORAL REEF?! You monster! You'll pay!</p>\n<p>2.Beach Ball- Random size each time! Fun for the party, not for the reef...</p>\n<p>3.Basketball-Doesn't float from the bottom, floats down from any area in the map. If you're unlucky the basketball can spawn at the very bottom!\u00a0</p>\n<p>4.Baseball-It was thrown into the water, instead of bouncing it started zooming down into the reef!</p>\n<p>5.Bowtie-It bounces around randomly, catch it before it catches the reef!</p>\n<p>6.Bowl-Press space to make sure that the bowl doesn't stay the the reef too long! It breaks apart so fast that the reef can go from 5-11 trash in 5 seconds of keeping it there!</p>\n<p>P.S:</p>\n<p>I found a bug I decided to keep in, if you press easy and hard immediately after each other, you get an extremely hard difficulty. So if you're a hardcore gamer, you should do that ;)</p><p>Narrative:</p>\n<p>You're a fishercat, and you realized that you kept netting up more plastic than fish!</p>\n<p>You took this up to the mayor, she agreed with you that you deserved a submarine to clean up the trash... A little over the top? ABSOLUTELY NOT!! Because if 80(60 on HARD) more trash reaches that Coral Reef, your town's seafood population is over, Coral Reefs take thousands of years to form. And if you let (60-80) trash reach the bottom the trash will ravage the reef! All the fish you eat and make money from will leave the reef because they have no more home. Thousands of animals will die. Undiscovered species will go extinct...</p>\n<p>If you let (60 or 80 depending on gamemode) trash reach the bottom before time's up, you've doomed your town's economy. The stakes are high, better get to cleaning.</p>\n<p>Made for #SeaJam, a Game Jam made to support #TeamSeas.
