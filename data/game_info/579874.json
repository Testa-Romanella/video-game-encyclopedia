Then, global warming became way worse. They settled on hiding underground until nature replenishes itself. 15 years later a boy named Kris, one of who didin't get to go underground, wanted to explore MT. Emmet. But all outlanders thought that there was a monster up there that gobbled up anyone who tresspasses. Kris didin't believe this though. When he got at the top, he tripped on a branch and fell in the hole. Thus begins the adventure of Kris, to team up with Rqalsiel and Chara, and (mostly) fight or spare their way to the barrier and finally send Ralsiel to break it. W.D. Gaster does not like this and tries to stop them.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T04:48:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/ebac64b5ef339ad07c3c4353aac1b972.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DJCraneJR"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
