Last as long as possible against an endless horde of enemies and then surrender in order to bank the bonus. Giving up has never been so rewarding. Collecting medals increased the multiplier, as well as contributing to the regualary increasing bonus score, and can be vacuumed up by not firing for a short period of time.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Six game modes:<br/><ol><li>Normal - Face an onslaught of enemies with just one life, but surrender before it's too late to escape and keep the bonus score.<br/></li><li>Novice - Like normal, but when you want an easier time (to begin with).<br/></li><li>Timed - 3 minutes, infinite lives and bombs, to score as much as you can. The multiplier resets when you bomb, how long can you hold off?<br/></li><li>Classic - 3 lives, 3 bombs, no surrender.<br/></li><li>Expert - One life, but the enemies are harder. If you don't surrender you don't score.<br/></li><li>Pacifist - No shooting allowed, score more for staying alive as long as possible. Enemies and bullets are grazeable to increase the mutliplier.</li></ol></li><li>Lots of enemies to kill.<br/></li><li>Plenty of bullets, and lasers, to dodge.<br/></li><li>A slow motion system that can kick in when the danger is too close, making the player temporarily invincible.<br/></li><li>Hidden methods to spawn more medals to collect...<br/></li><li>A dedicated button to giving up (well in four of the modes).<br/></li><li>Tate support.<br/></li><li>Customisable UI.<br/></li><li>Leaderboards &amp; achievements.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T06:22:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a35/a3512108ded9a32802ee0eb4f9824a7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Covert Sheep Example"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["The Covert Sheep Example"], "esrb_rating": null}
