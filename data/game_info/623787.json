Your task is to make your way through the bunker, uncover what happened there and make it out in one piece\u2026</p>\n<p>I chose to create this as my final year project as I wanted to see what I could create when bringing multiple skill sets of mine onto one single project. I also wanted to create a game with some story behind it and with some simpler mechanics, to try and create a game which creates interest and has character to it. I learned a lot from this project, from production based things such as effective time management, to being able to rapidly prototype mechanics and then polish them into a final product. As well as learning how to handle multi-disciplinary aspects of a game when I am responsible for them all.</p>\n<p>Visit my webpage for this game and other sections of my portfolio:</p>\n<p>https://liamdavies.carbonmade.com/project-vortex-shift</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:17:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecb/ecb538e5fddbed8905b17e9d890450dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam Davies"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
