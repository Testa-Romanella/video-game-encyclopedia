Once the jam is over and judging is done, I might add more levels.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Controls: arrows to move, Z to jump; or WASD to move, J to jump.  P to pause.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Also playable on my website.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:24:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a2/6a2b6a0bfd9edfc1f570917cb424ebe5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chridd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
