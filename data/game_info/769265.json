In our experience, users are able to hear the sounds of the colours they see as they wander through the mind of Wassily Kandinsky - an artist who had such condition. The goal of the user is to come closer to experiencing the sensation of synesthesia and see how he drew inspiration for his paintings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T12:29:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07ea5ca8fb7de747d7a1bfe6bd96b171.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NicholasRamsay"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
