Powerful, wall-climbing, rocket-jumping, artillery-pumping Robo-Tanks are the vehicle of choice in this fast-paced shootout, where the goal is to survive longer than the competition.

Compete on the global leaderboards to earn bragging rights and prestigious awards.<br/><br/><br/>These islands are populated by strange enemy tanks. They aren't the smartest, but they are certainly a nuisance. Destroy them quickly before they get a lucky shot off at you. They will drop any loot they've collected when destroyed, so target them when you're low on powerups or coins!<br/><br/><br/>Explore the islands for hidden loot and items to help you in your quest for the Victory Royale. Coins can be used to pre-load your tank with various weapons, shields, and stat buffs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-15T09:57:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ce/4ce5d325c90bfefed83fedec65983c35.jpg", "website": "https://rocketbotroyale.winterpixel.io/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 69}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Winterpixel Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Winterpixel Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
