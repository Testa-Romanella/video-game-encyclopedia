The purpose of this game is to avoid fall in to lava. Your opponents will try to push you with seismic waves to your doom. Try to dodge their attacks and deliver the orb to The Light for an extra life. This is a multiplayer game which is playable via LAN connection only.</p>\n<p>Geomancy is currently in the early stage of the development. In addition to fixing bugs and polishing stuff (e.g., a proper lobby, in - game events messages etc.), we plan to add new levels, characters and abilities. Furthermore, adding the bots to play against in single player would be nice (it's not a promise thou).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ced/cedc1b92c1ee632b0d94fef81d4bd470.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antonsem", "ibrahim"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
