There are charging pads all around you where you can recharge your energy and shots, BUT! If you recharge on a pad, it TRANSMITS a pulse throughout the level, giving away your position. You can use the pulses from other players to find them and defeat them. If you lose all your charge, you'll lose one heart. Lose all your hearts and you die. You can also fire at other players to make them lose hearts, so watch out for stray shots. The fewer players there are left, the faster your energy drains, so defeat your foes quickly!</p>\n<p>This is a 4-player split-screen there-can-be-only-one style game. It requires 4 controllers to play.</p>\n<p>This game was created for Global Game Jam 2018 with PIGSquad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2a/e2af8de7e4abfdc54b4b19fba1d61779.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["MBoffin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
