You wander around a generated level. And that IS what this game is...but it will definitely be more complicated later!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS: CLICK STUFF! Note that if you click the upper part of the playfield, you'll go upward; the right part, you'll go right, etc.. Clicking the corners is supposed to have other effects. Clicking the middle should do nothing.</p>\n<p>Update Nov. 30: Should work much better on mobile screens! I can now play it on my phone, so that's progress.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e8/4e85a49630061e5bba332419e2aa4701.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chaoseed"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
