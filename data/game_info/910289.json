The issue was that I wanted to have a fair fight against enemies, but this is quite hard since the AI needs to be built which takes time.\u00a0 For this game, there are now some enemies, but the big fight is rather against the bullets, so not 100% as I wanted it to be, but with the limited time all I could do.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope it is still fun, looking forward to your comments (and feel free to share your records :)).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy :)\r\n<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assets used:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Graphics:\u00a0<ul><li>https://craftpix.net/product/rpg-character-sprite-sheet-generator/</li><li>https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-battle-location-top-down-game-tileset-pack-1/</li></ul></li><li>Music:\u00a0https://motionarray.com/royalty-free-music/dark-movie-77561/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T09:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/227fa7e652ba478ea95c0e757bd574b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spinner-web"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
