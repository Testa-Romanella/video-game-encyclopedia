This is a post-postmodernism view on censorship.<br/></p>\n<p>The story follows a woman posting on a media sharing platform. The player chooses whether to give a positive or negative comment and the choice determines the woman\u2019s post. Negative posts change her attitude to be more miserable and wear more revealing clothes while positive clothes change her attitude to be more positive wearing less revealing clothes. The other websites' commenters and music change based on her attitude/the players' decisions. When the woman gets too much hate or too much love she deletes her account.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T09:23:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c5cb470afbd1f8f716895fcc64302c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AyeAyeRon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
