In this underwater adventure, you play the role of Neptune, an eager puppy looking to please his owner at his new underwater farm\u00a0 SeaBarks. Neptune is responsible for putting away the sea creatures, and protecting them from hungry sharks. Get the sea creatures in to correct pens and you will be rewarded with treats. What are you waiting for, let\u2019s get started!</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>\u00a0Use your keyboard arrows to move around, and the space bar to bark!</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Guide sea creatures into their pens, and the catch? Neptune holds himself to good boy standards and\u00a0wants to guide a minimum number of sea creatures to safety\u00a0(shown on each pen). Neptune's hard work does not go unnoticed, he receives a treat before em<em>barking</em> on his next duty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Barking can be used on the sea creatures and the shark to yield different results. For the sea creatures, barking has different effects on each creature (find out more on\u00a0hints screen) and barking at the shark scares them away when they are attacking.   </p>\n<p>The shark will think about its meal choice for a few seconds before they attack, be prepared to defend that creature! If the shark eats too many and you can no longer meet the farm\u2019s minimum requirements, it's level over. Don\u2019t worry, Neptune's owner always gives him another shot!</p>\r\nTEAM\r\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\r\nCITATIONS\r\n<p>\u00a0Background music taken from: https://www.freesfx.co.uk/\r\n  </p>\n<p>License agreement: https://www.freesfx.co.uk/Page/4/End-User-License-Agreement</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:13:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a54/a549752fffe949a2d339048600fd8539.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stacy_g"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
