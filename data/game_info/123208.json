The house was once home to a small family, consisting of only the parents and their young daughter. The house, though seemingly innocent by the exterior has been rumoured to host paranormal activities.</p><p>If you are 'lucky' you may see the lights flicker in rooms, and hear screams and cries echo through the night. People often report doors opening on their own even when you're the only one in the room. The oddest recurrence is the apparition of the young girl, though no body of her's has been found.</p><p>Do not enter the forest. Those who enter do not return.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9a/a9abd7eb46a5aacedcebad555f152ae5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["intronar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
