Thus there will be a lot of bugs, I will continue to try to update this to fix any and all bugs. However, this project is still a very cool and done project and I\u00a0hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>*DESCRIPTION*</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In Project Umbra, you play as a scout for a team of explorers who recently landed on the surface of an alien planet. The area you landed in has lush plant life, but before you landed there was a strange alien structure found to the north of where you landed. On your journey, you can uncover lore about the planet, the alien structure, and even\u00a0who was here before you.\u00a0Your task is to explore and find a safe route to this structure for your team to follow. This game is mainly a puzzle/platformer and will take about thirty minutes to an hour to complete.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you do decide to give it a try and play it, I\u00a0really appreciate it. Thank you!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n<strong>*NOTES*\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>- Version 1.5</p>\n<p>- Lots of bugs.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>*CONTROLS*</strong>\n</p>\n<p>MOVES - WASD\r\n</p>\n<p>CAMERA - MOUSE\r\n</p>\n<p>SHOOT - LEFT CLICK\r\n</p>\n<p>AIM - RIGHT CLICK\r\n</p>\n<p>INTERACT - E</p>\n<p>PAUSE - P or ESC</p>\n<p>SHIFT - RUN</p>\n<p>SPACE - JUMP</p>\n<p><strong>*CREDITS*</strong>\n</p>\n<p>-Khelben Leonard\r\n</p>\n<p>-Michael Mayer</p>\n<p>-Leanne Imkamp</p>\n<p>-Declan Shiner</p>\n<p>As well as most of the assets are from multiple packs by\u00a0Synty Studio.
