I thought it'd be nice to have my own version where two other characters ended up together instead. When I was 12 I went back to it and edited the music, but that was all. 7 years after the original copy I've finally found it, and I'm sharing it with all of you. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy this clich<em>\u00e9</em> garbage full of horrible grammar and tonnes of misspellings; 10-year-old me spent a lot of time on this. There's even a little credits video at the end &lt;3.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95e6b26bd84f73bc735e4e77db54703c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\u2122"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
