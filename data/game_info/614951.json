The plot centers around a hero, Farus, who must find four orbs to avert apocalypse. Farus is the only character central to the player&#39;s party; other members are recruited and may be dismissed if a superior replacement is found. The music was critically acclaimed, and two of its tracks were recorded by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra for release on the Orchestral Game Concert compilations. </p>\n<p>Has a fan translation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-27T01:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03d93a23d80ae9d6e4c83af421d5dfd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Copya Systems"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Asmik"], "esrb_rating": null}
