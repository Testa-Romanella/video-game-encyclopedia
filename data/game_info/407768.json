Somebody mixed up \"Outer Wilds\" and \"The Outer Worlds\". \"Just wait until Outer Words is released\", someone said.\u00a0<br/>\"I can't believe that doesn't exist\", mused someone else. \"Surely some random person would put out some joke game named that.\"</p>\n<p>Hi, I'm Meanwhile Games, and I am that random person. Outer Words is a joke gone too far. It's a prototype of a spelling game with orbital mechanics, and it's... actually pretty fun!</p>\n<p>Control your ship to select letters that spawn randomly and orbit the sun. If you form a word, the letters explode and you get points based on the word's length!</p>\n<p>There are some known issues that I'm not proud of, but weren't really necessary to address for the purposes of a prototype, so I left them be:</p>\n<ul><li>There's no sound. It's set in space, and there's no sound in space, so, uh, that's\r\ndefinitely an intentional design decision. Definitely.</li><li>There's no way to spell longer words that start with smaller words (ex. you can't spell\r\n\"TENT\" because it matches \"TEN\" first).</li><li>\u00a0You can fly through the sun. This is fine.</li><li>\u00a0You can also fly off into space and lose your ship.</li><li>The dictionary is weird and doesn't contain a lot of words that seem like they\r\nshould be valid and also does contain things that I'm pretty sure aren't real words.\r\nThis is just a prototype so I'm at the mercy of free dictionaries available to\r\nme.</li><li>There's no end game condition; you basically just play until you're bored.</li></ul>\n<p>Special credits to:</p>\n<ul><li>Kenney's assets for space sprites</li><li>This GitHub repository with a list of the 10,000 most common English words according to Google's database.</li><li>Connor Shearwood of Shearwood Games for his help with orbital mechanics! In fact, he's got a Kickstarter campaign going right now, at time of writing, for a board game about orbital mechanics! The board has segments that physically spin so your pieces orbit around the sun. You should definitely check it out.</li><li>The fine folks on the Game Maker's Toolkit Patreon Discord server. Without their pun proficiency, the concept of this game would never have existed.</li><li>Outer Wilds, an incredible and unique game about exploring a solar system and unraveling an ancient mystery.</li><li>The Outer Worlds, a game from the creators of classic Fallout and Fallout: New Vegas, set in space. I haven't actually played this one, but I hear it's pretty good!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T02:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a89/a89d07db7ceeae772726c590f854c08d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Meanwhile Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
