However, you have a magic map that shows you the reality of the dungeon. There are many fake walls, buttons, mazes and puzzles that stand between you and the end of the dungeon, but with the map you are confident that you\u00a0will find a way out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T10:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e7/3e79990c1700912d5eee0cec3cfa6d7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Trashbag8"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
