You can only continue to accept the 'challenge' and explore why you lost your memory and why you are trapped here.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Janus Project\" is a first-person perspective room escape game. The game is not big, but it does not mean that you can easily pass it. We are even considerate for players who really can't pass it. After many failures, you are given the option to jump directly to the level. Of course, we recommend that you challenge yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe whole game will burn your brain like crazy, and if you feel tired, what you should do is close the game and take a rest.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter beating the true ending of the game, some levels in the main line will be unlocked in the trophy mode, and you can take on more difficult challenges than in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T08:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/151/15192029af91bff68200cfafcbbbac3e.jpg", "website": "https://space.bilibili.com/1684532289", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u65cb\u5ba2\u6587\u5316"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u65cb\u5ba2\u6587\u5316"], "esrb_rating": null}
