It's my first time doing a game jam and I learned a lot. Unfortunately, I only found out about the game jam when there were fewer than 6 days remaining. I really could have used that extra day. I plan on releasing an updated version with the features that didn't quite make it into this build.</p>\n\n<p>Game Summary:</p>\n<p>You are a wizard specialising in one of four schools of magic: fire, wood, electricity, or water. Spells are represented as cards. Each card has its own element and a target element. You can theoretically play your whole hand every turn if you can chain your cards properly.</p>\n<p>Defeating monsters and finding treasure increases your power. You can take a portal to a new world, but each time you do so the strength of the enemies will increase. Your goal is to beat a boss on each elemental world, unlocking the portal to the final world and boss.</p>\n\n<p>Contest Stuff:</p>\n<p>This game is turn-based.</p>\n<p>Worlds, cards, encounters, and treasure are all random. Some probabilities are affected by the game state. For instance, your chosen element will skew the options you get when levelling up, although all options can still appear for all characters.</p>\n<p>There are no saves, and there is no meta-progression. Every run starts the same, aside from your chosen element.</p>\n<p>I was torn about marking this game as complete or not. The game has all the core systems in place, so it's mostly lacking in content. Since I didn't get much time to test it and I wanted to do more with it than I did, I said it was incomplete.</p>\n\n<p>Download:</p>\n<p>Go\u00a0here\u00a0to download the game. \"AstralPath.zip\" is the game jam version, while \"AstralPath1.2.zip\" is the most recent version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T21:18:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5e/b5e2c8021594b46493a16370b6e00e41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mauvebutterfly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
