I was only able to implement two of five elements; Wood and Fire. <br/></p>\n<p>The intention was a 2D platformer in similar manner as Castlevania where the player would go unlock each element after defeating the relevant boss before battling the final bosses: Yin and Yang.</p>\n<p>When the player had unlocked an element, the element would provide the player a new ability:<br/>- Wood: basic projectile attack<br/>- Fire: melee range fireblast, 3 damage over 3 seconds<br/>- Earth: short range spike that pushes enemies back<br/>- Metal: medium range that stuns enemies for short time<br/>- Water: long range that slows enemies</p>\n<p>Each element are effective (increased damage/effect) against another element and also ineffective (reduced damage/effect) against another element, based on Wu Xing philosophy.<br/></p>\n<p>Only one enemy was implemented:<br/>- Snake: harmless snake that just runs away</p>\n<p>This was my first real attempt at a game with Godot Engine.
