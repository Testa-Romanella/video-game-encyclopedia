This has been the final project of our Virtual Reality and Concept Art Masters. The purpose of the project was to have our students work under the pressure and deadlines of an actual work environment, and have them create a game from scratch in just six weeks. Before this project our students were trained in the fundamental skills to become game designers and concept artists in just 4 months. A truly intense and information packed training that they passed with flying colors!</p>\n<p>www.bigrock.it/corsi/mastervr\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:02:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed2/ed25eab2728c0f00cb8ff274d4187210.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BigRockSchool"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
