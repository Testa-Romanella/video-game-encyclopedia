The German Army had their last toehold on the Dneiper River. This salient projected between two powerful Soviet army groups, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts. Though weakened in their previous efforts against the Germans, on January 25th and 26th, these two powerful groups attacked and surrounded two German corps.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Germans responded quickly to this threat, hurrying reinforcements from other sectors. Their relief drive made good initial progress, but stalled in the face of stiff Soviet resistance and both sides antagonist, \"General Mud\". In the end, the trapped Germans made a desperate break out attempt from the pocket. Less than half of the encircled forces escaped the trap, with none of their heavy weapons or equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBattle For Korsun is a simulation of these battles in January and February 1944. Players control the various German and Soviet forces which took part in these struggles.
