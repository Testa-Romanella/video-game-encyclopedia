Unlike most economy sims, prices are set by each individual store based on their own supply and demand instead of in a common market.</p>\n<p>In Jonestown information is valuable. People can only shop at stores that they already know about. Information moves through the system through conversations between people in the town, so knowledge of your shop will spread by word of mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please your customers, and your business will grow, but be careful- if you don't have what they're looking for they'll find somewhere else to shop, and they're loyal. Once you lose them you'll have a hard time getting them back.</p>\n<p>Game is more interesting than fun.\u00a0Screen size not adjustable. Disabling AI control of business not recommended. \u00a0Bug in Windows where it occasionally skips days for some reason, but that doesn't seem to cause any problems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Works best with Doug Miles'\u00a0Black Chancery font installed.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85ae0b569795006a1aaf8355856afe7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["markemus"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
