It stands for my\u00a0participation to the C64 Cassette 50 Charity Competition:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/the-c64-cassette-50-charity-competition</p>\n<p>The rules are very simple and based on a famous puzzle game. Throw bubbles in the gaming area in order to empty the playfield.\u00a0When 3 bubbles are connected, they explode (+5pts) and cause the neighbouring orphaned bubbles to fall (+10pts). There are 3 different levels that loop once completed.</p>\n<p>The game is lost\u00a0when the fired bubble runs out of space.</p>\n<p>You have only one attempt per game, but in return you are not stressed by time\u00a0.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Joystick in Port 2. Press left and right to move the target and\u00a0change the aiming angle. Press fire to release the bubble.</p>\n<p>According to the competition rules, the binary executable\u00a0is lower than 4Kbytes and cannot write to memory higher than $0FFF. It cannot be downloaded before the end of the contest. Tested on real hardware (it need to be loaded from\u00a0disk/tape in order for the memory trick to work).<br/></p>\n<p>Code, Gfx and sound by Pixs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:29:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dc/1dcf51b68de4086353efce8afeae6976.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pixs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
