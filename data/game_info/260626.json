Found out about the bite sized horror jam yesterday and thought it would be fun to enter, so I made this little game. <br/>Anyway onto a game description.</p>\n<p>You are paranormal ghost detective Ghostly Jones and it seems someone has summoned you by accident. Things like this happen sometimes when you're on the reverse-homicide division of the ghost police. This time is strange though, as some force is keeping you from simply phasing though the walls, so you need to take the door like a normal person, er, ghost? This game is a short little game completable in roughly 2-3 minutes if not less depending on your deduction skills.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/512/5126d99a00a658f495da28cd02681202.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["SpaceCats64"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
