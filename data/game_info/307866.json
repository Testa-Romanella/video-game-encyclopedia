The game originated as my bachelor degree project within 3 months of work, all from scratch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, you will connect nodes together to execute code, it's all visual, you don't code a single line. The challenge is to solve the riddles with as few nodes as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perpetua is just a prototype, containing 5 small levels that each explain another node and a final challenge to test your skills. so make sure to play all 6 levels if you think its to easy.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I'm not interested in money here but the more in feedback ! please let me know everything you like or dislike about the game ! Because : Currently I'm itterating on the ideas and will start a new project based on perpetua if the response of the community is positive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T05:56:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d1/2d1d267b7224ba096f478e9ac42d5a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MarcelArioli"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
