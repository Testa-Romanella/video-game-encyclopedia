All the cat wants is to go to bed and settle in for a good night's sleep. But alas!\u00a0The cat\u00a0can't find its bed! It seems that you will have to help the cat find its bed by navigating a series of mazes and challenges. You will have to be careful to pick up toys the cat needs to sleep and avoid terrifying hazards, such as tinfoil. Make sure to step wisely when you encounter the house dog as well. The goal is to get through all of the mazes and challenges to finally allow the cat to enter it's bed and get a good night's sleep!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Select:</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>Shift</li><li><strong>Start: </strong>Option/Alt or Enter</li><li><strong>Movement:</strong></li><ul><li><strong>Up:</strong> Up arrow or W</li><li><strong>Down:</strong>\u00a0Down arrow or S</li><li><strong>Left:</strong>\u00a0Left arrow or A</li><li><strong>Right:</strong>\u00a0Right arrow or D</li></ul><li><strong>Interact w Characters:</strong> Option/Alt</li><li><strong>Advance Text:\u00a0</strong>Option/Alt</li></ul>\n<p>Enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T05:21:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13f90e04521792688e83fecfaf95b43c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["akschoenbauer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
