You only have a certain amount of bounces and make sure you use all, otherwise they will get subtracted from your bounce capacity! Once you think you figured out the puzzle press SPACE to shoot the ball. The ball is always fired to the right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>! EPILEPSY ALERT:</p>\n<p>Due to some flickering rendering people with epilepsy should be careful. I am by no means an expert when it comes to epilepsy and do not know to what degree it will affect you, but trying out the first level will give you an idea of what I'm talking about.</p>\n\n<p>Known issues:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Sometimes the ball doesn't collide with a finish correctly. Just try again after the reset.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- DutchDave (D.v.E): in-game art (sprites), background music, all gameplay. Solely made by me.
