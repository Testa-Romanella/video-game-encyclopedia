Because of that half of our games are missing. What is posted here is what remains of this project. It was an ambition project from the start for a weekend with actual art and out scoped toolkit and abilities for the player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the final build we were able to put together. You can download an older build of the game that had a first draft of the missing level....</p>\n<p>here:\u00a0https://seanmany.github.io/excitingtitle.html</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Stephen Lane - Design/ Programming</p>\n<p>Tisha Boonyawatana - Design / Art</p>\n<p>Sean Maguire - Design/ Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53d/53da10067ec5529115bd280b102b5e92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sean Maguire"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
