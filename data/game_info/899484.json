With the help of their ability to do whatever they please within the dream, the character can surpass his physical limits and perform stunts that would be impossible to do in real life. Once you start the game, the character already has 5 years of experience with lucid dreaming. Throughout these years, he has learned to jump really high, sprint unrealistically fast and swim relatively well despite the fact that even treading water is a very admirable skill to have when lucid dreaming. During these past 5 years, they have also been working on building their dream world with the help of the Titanias, the people of the dream world! But deep within the mysteries of dreams lie nightmares. Entering a lucid dream is equivalent to entering the world of the Titanias, so now, their enemy is your enemy too. Get along with the Titanias and maybe they'll let you in on a few secrets about the origin of the Conqueror of Dreams, Nue, the enemy of the Titanias. </p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move - WASD</p>\n<p>Jump - SPACE</p>\n<p>Sprint - Left Shift / Right Shift / Right Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Attack - Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Pick Up Items - F</p>\n<p>Drop Items - G</p>\n<p>Interact with NPCs - F</p>\n<p>Toggle Quest Menu On/Off - Q</p>\n<p>Open Dream Journal - J</p>\n<p>Toggle Controls Overlay On/Off - C</p>\n<p>Pause Game - ESC / P</p>\r\nThanks for checking out my game :))", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T14:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29e2765d05bb883eafd20f2fed155a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["triple_a821"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
