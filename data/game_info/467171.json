Limit your shots and risk being overrun by enemies, or spray bullets and watch as things go haywire.\u00a0It's a pretty simply game, but it gets harder the longer you survive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as the little\u00a0<strong>Green Ship</strong>, and you're being relentlessly chased by\u00a0<strong>Orange Space Bug... Things</strong>.\u00a0You shoot\u00a0<strong>Blue Bullets</strong> to take our enemies, but any bullets that miss will bounce off the wall and turn into\u00a0<strong>Pink Bullets</strong>, which will kill you! Use WASD or the arrow keys to move, aim with the mouse, and shoot with left mouse click.</p>\n<p>How high of a score can you get?</p>\r\n\"Out of Control\"\r\n<p>I was inspired by the theme of this year's GMTK Game Jam, \"Out of Control\", to think about mechanics in games you rely on to be under your command and see if I could\u00a0remove that control to turn the tables on the player.</p>\r\nBy the way...\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This is my first game!\u00a0This game jam seemed like a great opportunity to finally give game development a shot. I've spent the last 48 hours learning how to develop in Unity, and even learned some pixel art basics, and I had a blast doing it. Major thank you to Brackeys, MortMort, and the Unity message boards for all the help! There are a million things I'd love to improve about the game (like, uh, maybe some sound?), but I'm pretty pleased to even have something to submit!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0e/a0e4fadd670c7f793fb08cbb93ae2d10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["momar2099"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
