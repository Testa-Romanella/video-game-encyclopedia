Nurture its roots and watch as they spread and reach for the essence of life. With each step, the tree will grow, and soon become a thriving ecosystem, teeming with tiny creatures. Immerse yourself in a tranquil world where you can find inner peace and discover the beauty of renewal.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls: <strong>left click</strong> to place roots, <strong>right click</strong> to rotate, and look up and down by bringing your mouse close to the edge of the screen.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This being a game jam product, we were pressed on time and didn't bother implementing any of that pesky UI, be it menus or a way to exit the game.
