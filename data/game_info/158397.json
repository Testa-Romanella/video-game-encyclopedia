You just happen to be passing though.\u00a0 The man\u2019s got a lot of stories to tell, but he won\u2019t force you to listen to them if you don\u2019t want to.\u00a0 Should you stick around the stories you listen to might very well get to be a part of them.</p>\n\n<p>The visual inspiration for the game is pretty clear, there's no way I could come up with a unique art style in only a few weeks having hardly touched photoshop before.\u00a0 Instead I went with the simplest style I could think of that still retained color and character: Sword and Sworcery's.\u00a0 This is really their look, not mine, but hopefully as time goes on I'll get more comfortable to bring my own style to these characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/808/8086da94b86c10040e2611082db9623f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jimi stine"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
