In this Platformer-Shooter game, you start out as a small alien known as SC-01, and your task is to collect as many minerals as you can while avoiding the danger that will come your way. You have weapons to defend yourself of course which includes a Jetpack, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, Grenades, Sniper Rifles, and even a Plasma Flamethrower! You must complete each level by entering the teleporter and then hopefully win the game once you've beaten all of the levels.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Follow the game here:</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/MtZTdVR<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/SpaceCollecters</p>\n<p>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU9tkaGK526IKY5UAp93AKA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T08:25:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/9058c080a15d236c37c5914c5707e8b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceGames3"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
