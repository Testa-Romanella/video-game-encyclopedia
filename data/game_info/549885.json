But, be careful! Because the less the length of the worm, the more powerful it becomes.</p>\n<p>The game was originally intended to be part of the Blackthornprod 2021 game jam, but I missed the deadline. This is also my first game ever and it has been made in a week, so it's kinda messy, lol.</p>\n<p>I made everything from scratch except for the font used for the dialogues and menus. The font used is Barcade Brawl by Pixel Kitchen.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T03:33:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d680ed5fe80b09272b85520a2af80dad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BergosWasAlreadyTaken"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
