Shoot the charged targets to gain speed - but don't miss!</p>\n<p>My first game, created with Unreal Engine 5 and NVIDIA Ray Tracing for the\u00a0Epic MegaJam 2022.<br/></p>\n<p>Your bullets slice targets in half using procedural meshes at runtime. Includes a day-night cycle with dedicated music playlists for each. Everything is built from the friendly Chamfer Cube! Your speed increases with the square root of targets hit, so there is no limit.... can you break the game?</p>\n<p>Login with an Epic Games account is supported, but not required. I almost managed to create an online leaderboard instead of keeping it local, but it did not make it in time.\u00a0An RTX graphics card is highly recommended.</p><p>Donate:\u00a0bc1pm754pvwk026xlksl2y8ew7hpu8swqp3aludjxwmelwvqcmx069fqc40k0h</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T17:30:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/520/52074a5f292f49782dc5b13d856cb8c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cr4y7"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
