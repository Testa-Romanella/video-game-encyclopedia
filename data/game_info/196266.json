Donations will go toward acquiring more music as well as buying beans by the bushel for the developer. As of now, there are about 30 different fart sounds which are all real. We recently added a third level and made levels two and three much harder. We also added jumping and fart gas animations. More levels will be added periodically that contain all new fart sounds. The end goal is to have a polished fart app platform game that will keep you laughing until you are lightheaded.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThank you for your support!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tLightheaded Games\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e7/8e7cb57536b14a45af29e79630ec5400.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lightheaded Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
