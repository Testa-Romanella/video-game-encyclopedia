I worked on this game for a little less than 3 days so don't expect anything exceptional (or good) (or decent) (or functional).. Still, this was a fun experience. I had previously worked on a Ludum Dare game but that time I wasn't alone, so this time I had to go full speed the entire time.</p>\n<p>Enough blogging: in this game you have to take care of your new daughter. Through a series of (a whole THREE!) mini games, you can raise (or decrease) her stats. If you make mistakes in the mini games, her happiness level will go down. If it reaches zero, the game will end and you'll have to start again with a new daughter (who surprisingly looks exactly like the last one! because I didn't have time to implement the hair color randomization)</p>\n<p>You may find the controls bad (you probably will, they're pretty shit) but you should be able to change them in the dialog window that appears when you launch the game. Hopefully you can find a control scheme that works better for you. Unfortunately the button labels on the UI won't change (I don't know how to do that yet).</p>\n<p>Aaaanyway, the game<em><strong> should</strong></em> work, but I haven't really playetested a lot so I'm sure there are a lot of broken features and bugs. One that I know of that I may fix before the deadline if I can, is in the math mini game. There's a timer to complete each operation but it doesn't work (it used to but there I changed some thing around... you know how it goes) so even if time runs out nothing will happen until you complete the operation.</p>\n<p>As I said in the beginning, having only 72 hours to work means I had to massively reduce the scope of the game and I had to remove some features. One that I'm really sad didn't make it is the shop, where you can buy head ornaments and toys for your daughter to play with. It didn't have high priority on my to do list but I really wanted to have it.\u00a0 If I ever make a v2 update, this feature will surely be in.</p>\n<p>I said above that the game might be buggy and broken, so please if you run into any kind of problem, leave a comment. I may be able to fix it quickly. Thank you and enjoy the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update: I will fix the controls and the math minigame (and a couple of minor things) as soon as I wake up tomorrow. Stay tuned!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Update2: Turns out I can't update the game until the voting for the Jam is over. Makes sense. I'll upload the new version as soon as possible.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47249242126daff80713e0d93f19209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquareDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
