Stop them!<br/>We have an advantage: We are FASTER. Our engines are capable of doing \"Juxtaposition Ultra Movement Positioning\", or JUMPs, as we call it.<br/>It will not be easy, as the Dragon drones can invade our Jumps, attacking us inside while traveling faster than light. These drones are predictable and always act by following pre-set patterns, but too many drones within the JUMP can be certain death!<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>It's a Tactics SHMUP!<br/></li><li>A excellent Coffee break game.<br/></li><li>Not only inspired by the classic Shmups and Bullet Hells, it\u2019s also influenced by tactical games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Jeanne d\u2019Arc and Roguelikes like FTL and Crypt of the NecroDancer.<br/></li><li>Be a pilot of the Bastards Federation: A group formed by the Elves, Humans, Dwarves and Orcs who used to live in peace, sharing their love for all Beverages.<br/></li><li>Your mission: JUMP!
