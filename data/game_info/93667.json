It features two classic combat styles, WAIT and ATB, that can be toggled outside of battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Wait -</strong> Better for novice players. Enemies do not attack while you're selecting moves.</p>\n<p><strong>Active time battle -</strong> For more seasoned RPG players. Enemies can attack while you're selecting moves. You can choose between five battle speeds ranging from slowest to fastest, each speed determining how long it takes for the enemy to be able to attack again.</p>\n\n\n<p>SYNC Moves \u2014\u00a0Characters that work together in battle can build up their SYNC. Once the SYNC meter for two teammates reaches 100%, these heroes can unleash a powerful move that can deal major damage, fully heal its users, or maybe even provide buffs depending on how the two synced characters interact with one another.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The Amazing Fantastics features cutscenes that look like they're straight out of a comic book.</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a12b1c6ae545956ef9b175ac29de4dd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neon Arkade Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
