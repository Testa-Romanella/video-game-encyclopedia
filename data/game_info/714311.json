{"id": 714311, "slug": "doodle-course-phaser-3", "name": "Doodle Course [Phaser 3]", "name_original": "Doodle Course [Phaser 3]", "description": "<p>In Doodle Course the objective is to get the ball from the start of the level to the end. The problem is that there is no path for the ball to roll on. The player must build the path themselves by placing platforms and other items around the level, this will allow the ball to get to the end of the level.</p>\n<strong>Features<br/></strong>\n<strong>Movable Platform</strong> <br/>This  platform can be moved around  by the player                     by  left-clicking on it and dragging  with the                     mouse.  The platform can also be rotated in  15                     degree  increments.<br/><strong>Jump Pad</strong> <br/>The jump pad is an object that  will add an                     immediate force to the ball in the  direction that                     the jump pad is facing. This will  happen when the                     ball collides with the jump pad.<br/><strong>Spikes</strong> <br/>Spikes will immediately destroy  the ball as soon as                     they collide with it.<strong>Anti-Gravity Zone</strong>\n<br/>These zones occupy a large space. When the                     ball enters the zone, the gravity acting upon the                     ball will be disabled. This will remain true until                     the ball leaves the anti-gravity zone again. the                     anti-gravity zone is a good way for the player to                     get the ball up to a higher position.\r\nPencil vs Crayon\r\n<p>The image on the left is supposed to look like it was drawn in pencil and the image on the right is supposed to look like it was drawn in crayon (we really didn't nail that one). In the game, pencil is used to indicate objects which the player is able to move, and crayon indicates things the player cannot move. Some objects in the game, like jump pads, will have pencil and crayon versions i.e. movable and immovable versions.<br/></p>\n\r\nBugs / Issues\r\n<ul><li>Sometime you might select a Jump Pad but will not be able to move or rotate \t\tit with the keyboard keys. If this happens just click off the Jump Pad and \t\tclick it again. Make sure you click near the center of the Jump Pad.</li><li>You will find that the ball bounces differently each time you hit play even if the platforms have\u00a0not\u00a0been\u00a0moved.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Developers:</strong><br/>Scott Ewing<br/>Ross Derrick<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong><br/>2D Platformer Level Kit<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/2d-platformer-level-kit-14...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab8/ab899aba67a9adb0f0bf18f0d8374f37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Scott-Ewing"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
