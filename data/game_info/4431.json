A classic 2.5D side-scrolling shooter, revitalized with modern game design.</p>\n<p>You take control of P. Walter Tugnut (The \u201cP\u201d stands for \u201cPickles\u201d), a regular guy who stockpiles guns, ammo, and beer in his dilapidated RV awaiting the inevitable robot apocalypse. When the abandoned factory in the distance begins producing robots on its own, Walter sets off in his RV on a robot-killing rampage, hoping to save humanity from an onslaught of robot hordes.</p>\n<p>Developed by Demiurge Studios, collaborators on Borderlands\u2122, Brothers in Arms\u00ae, and Mass Effect\u2122.</p>\n\nKey Features:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>4-Player Co-op</strong><br/> \nUp to four players online working together to take down robot armies.</li>\n<li><strong>Character Customization</strong><br/>\nWearing a tutu isn\u2019t just a fashion statement; it\u2019s a strategy.
