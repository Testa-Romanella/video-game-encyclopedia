The local kingfisher is... a bit of a handful. Can you help her overcome her existential crisis and take the perfect photo to please your editor?</p>\n<p>This short visual novel takes around fifteen minutes to complete, is build to run on original Game Boy Color hardware, and features two possible endings.</p>\n<p>PS: There's nothing wrong with your speaker, this game currently has no sound. It's probably for the best, given the kingfisher's singing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T05:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edf/edf1438c6f0543ba58b2868ca657f380.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VideoGameStoryTime"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
