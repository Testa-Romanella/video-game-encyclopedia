Our game is <strong>MINI-GOLF</strong> where you only get <strong>ONE PUTT</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell me about it!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You're not just any mini-golf aficionado; you're the best mini-golfer in the world.</p>\n<p>You can beat any course in just one shot\u2026 except you sometimes need to fix the course as you go. After all, you only miss because the course is wrong.</p>\n<p>Take careful aim, make your putt, but this is only the beginning! Use the <strong>WASD </strong>keys and the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> to manipulate the course and show off your <strong>HOLE IN\u00a0</strong><strong>ONE PUTTING SKILLS!</strong> Careful, though. Other mini-golfers are here to watch your fine performance; messing with the course too much will make them suspicious!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mouse</strong> - Set putt direction, click and drag backwards, then release to putt!</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> - Tilts the course.</p>\n<p><strong>SPACEBAR</strong> - Freezes traps in place.</p>\n<p><strong>BACKSPACE</strong> - Resets the course<strong>.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>TAB</strong> - Opens in-game menu.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Created By:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Chootin, Oscar, P3TE</p>\n\n<p>Chootin &amp; P3TE are Blind Mystics<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:13:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb6/bb6f5a8b8abb49cf2fd11dd3f32cf3b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blind Mystics", "Chootin", "P3TE"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
