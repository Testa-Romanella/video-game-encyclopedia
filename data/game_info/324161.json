In the lands controlled by the Helvetii, a Roman legion was subjugated by young warchief Divico, blessed by a ancient boon brought to him from parts unknown. However, this victory came at a great cost, as soon the result of the warchief&#39;s pact would turn into a curse; an ever spreading rot crawling through his land, and slowly corrupting his mind and heart.<br />\nWith the help of the trusted yet reclusive druid Nammeios and the curious half-beast Renart, Divico sets his journey to undo the source of the rot and restore what was lost inside him. Through his own martial prowess and powers conferred by the old gods, the fight ahead promises to be intense.<br />\n&quot;Easy to learn, hard to master&quot; character action mechanics: Use a variety of combo moves and the environment around you to dispatch your enemies in spectacular fashion. Play up to three distinct characters, each with their own play style and master their techniques<br />\nThe ever changing rot: Experience each run differently: Rooms, powerups, bosses and challenges will vary every time you set out to fight the rot. Learn, adapt and master your strategies to get to the end of your run!<br />\nLove in the art:Inspired by other action games from the likes of Vanillaware, each background and character is painted with care, and animated in detail. The soundtrack is composed by the talented Dale North and with the participation of Nier: Automata&#39;s singer Emi Evans.<br />\nThe secret of the Gauls: Discover the ancient Celtic world of the Gauls, mixed in with more unique legends from Swiss and Germanic folklore. Journey from yet untamed forests to abandoned villages overtaken by cultists, merciless snowy caps, underground tunnels and beyond...<br />\nWe have now been working for a while on Helvetii from our humble studio here in Switzerland. Our primary goal is to share our love for precise and intense character action mechanics by making absolutely sure combat is fine-tuned and always enjoyable,  mixed with the best art we can provide. This is a project we&#39;ve been caring a lot for a long time, and we really hope our excitement will reach all the players out there!<br />\nWe wish to thank anyone who shares our passion and decides to support and believe in us. Let&#39;s all do our best!<br />\n- Kevin and Isa, from Team KwaKwa</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-31T10:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d11dd3a864c1bc0005cbf66b66caa927.jpg", "website": "http://helvetii-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 476, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team KwaKwa"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DANGEN Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
