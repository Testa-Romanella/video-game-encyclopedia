We're happy to give you guys a cheesy sappiness of a visual novel once more ; u ;\r\n</p><p>\n<em>From Salt to Sugar</em> is a bit longer than our first one, and we tried our best to build and improve from N&amp;F: All That's Inbetween (here if you haven't played through it before!) We had more time to do this (even though we were all busy with school and other things ((especially artist cause she had a stressful month, but still managed to pull through!));;;) so hopefully it's at least better than the previous!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe hope you enjoy!<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/334/334638be4e9e39589f01e8986d2ae583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TeamANPIM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
