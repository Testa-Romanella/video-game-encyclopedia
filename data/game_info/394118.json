{"id": 394118, "slug": "mechscape", "name": "MechScape", "name_original": "MechScape", "description": "<p>Try the demo!</p>\n<p>(Please give the demo time to load)</p>\n\n<p><strong>A sci-fi RPG that evokes turn-of-the-century nostalgia</strong></p>\n<p>MechScape is a RPG designed to embody the unique \u201ccyber\u201d brand of science fiction of the late 1990s-early 2000s in both its art style and its dialogue style. Mechanical beings, a post-apocalyptic setting, and of course, cyberspace- it\u2019s all here!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Experience an intriguing story illustrated in a retro style</strong></p>\n<p>At some point in the distant future, a Security Robot is revived due to a freak accident. Urged on by the mysterious being speaking to it through its radio, the robot traverses the alternate dimension contained in electrical systems known as Cyberspace. Along its journey, Security Bot will be forced into conflict with the Viruses that now rule the planet. Fortunately, it possesses the ability to assimilate the Skills of these creatures and delete them. With its mission thus, this lone robot forges on- in search of what, it does not yet know.</p>\n<p>The saga of the Security Bot is illustrated in a retro low-poly style that perfectly emulates the early-3D look of video games released in the 64-bit/fifth generation era.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Copy the abilities of the hostile creatures you meet and use their powers against them</strong></p>\n<p>To delete the hostile Viruses that it finds itself facing off against, the Security Bot must copy their Skills. This power is the basis of MechScape\u2019s core gameplay feature- the ability to duplicate the abilities of your opponents and use them as your own. To win, you\u2019ll need to gather Skills and use them in a strategic manner- no mashing \u201cAttack\u201d here!</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cEarly bird price\u201d in effect</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For a limited time, you can grab MechScape for only $4.99!
