Being a teenager is always challenging, especially when you just moved to a new town with your dad. Make choices for Mary as she goes about her day and discover her mysterious past and decide what her fate will be!</p>\n\n<p>The objective of my interactive fiction is accomplished by creating a hypertext story that utilizes the replayability of this multicursal medium in order to have different outcomes for different choices made in the game. In my game a teenager named Mary moves to a new town with her father who is being especially short tempered lately. The player is not given any information about Mary\u2019s history and only knows that Mary is not thrilled to be in her new, relatively isolated, home and town.\u00a0Play through a day in Mary's life and find out more about Mary's past. These discoveries, depending on what they are, reach different conclusions to the story.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T03:47:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fd2edabbc6dbc48ee29c4db369eefd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["gamesarefun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
