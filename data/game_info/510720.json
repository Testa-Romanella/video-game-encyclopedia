Each plot (grouping of 3, outlined) must have all the same vegetable or all different vegetables. Neighbors (orthogonal across a fence-edge) that are not in the same plot <strong><em>must </em></strong>be different.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Left click on spots to cycle through options.</li><li>Scroll wheel to zoom.</li><li>Right click to move camera around.</li><li>Middle click to center camera on mouse</li><li>Hold middle click to reset camera view</li></ul>\n<p>The puzzle is a 'harvest' theme of the logic puzzle Triplets invented by Naoki Inaba.\r\nThe puzzle is generated when you hit play with an inefficient backtracking solver, that performs reasonably well for 9x9 and smaller puzzles.</p>\n<p>The generator does not create puzzles that have a necessarily unique solution, which is the primary weakness. (It slowed generation down to unacceptable levels).<br/></p>\n<p> It's possible the solver can fail (especially for the \"The 12\" difficulty), in which case you will see a board that is mostly empty with a few all-one-vegetable regions.</p>\n<p>As a jam game, there were of known bugs and features I didn't get to:</p>\n<ul><li>The input system isn't ideal</li><li>No hints/display of incorrect spots (Sorry! Good luck!)</li><li>Generated puzzles likely do not have unique solutions</li><li>There is no audio </li><li>The puzzle generator does not fail gracefully or informatively, and could (hypothetically?) exceed WebGL memory</li><li>No undo's</li><li>No saving - you can't come back to a puzzle</li></ul>\n<p>Assets Used<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Font Daydream by DoubleGum</li><li>Font Pixel Love by Mirz123</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:59:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbf4ec10dec9397eb3fdf92bd8bb214b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hunter Dyar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
