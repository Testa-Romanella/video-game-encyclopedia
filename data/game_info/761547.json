I've been participating in Ludum Dare since before I started high school, and now I'm a college senior. To celebrate Ludum Dare's 20th anniversary, I decided to remake my first ever Ludum Dare game, which was also my first ever video game. Although it's no longer available to download since my DropBox got deleted, you can still see the original game's submission page in the wayback machine here: http://web.archive.org/web/20201128165033/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-...</p>\n\n<p>In 50 Second Apocalypse, the world is going to end in just 50 seconds. You don't have the power to save it, but you can delay the inevitable. Collect 3 time crystals to rewind time by 20 seconds. Careful! You'll have to get past the zombie hordes, and you only have 6 shots. Fortunately, time travel can help you get those bullets back, but it won't give you back any health you lost. See how long you can survive and how many zombies you can kill before you meet the inevitable!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys: move</p>\n<p>C: shoot</p>\n\n<p>Score:</p>\n<p>Zombies: 1 point</p>\n<p>Crystals: 3 points</p>\n<p>Post your best score bellow!</p>\n\n<p>Tools used:</p>\n<ul><li>MonoGame</li><li>Visual Studio 2019</li><li>Tiled Map Editor</li><li>Paint.net</li><li>Aseprite</li><li>Beep Box</li><li>BFXR</li><li>Audacity</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T08:58:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cf21521e25ebc23f0c96f0942eedab5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eli Vazquez"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
