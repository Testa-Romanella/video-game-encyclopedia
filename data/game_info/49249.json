A real genocide.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEarth also seems to be overwhelmed by the assault and only a small group, scouting near Encelade manageto avoid the attack. By approching the icy surface of the moon there is still one last hope of a counter attack againt the ennemy from another world.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnceladus is a shoot'em up inspired by the Playstation &amp; Saturn era infused with mecanical gameplay and modern artistic style.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEasy to handle, skill will be needed in order to beat the 7 levels available.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player takes control of \u00ab Frost \u00bb, a spaceship capable of firing energy blast or to channel a very powerful laser. He also has the ability to trigger a powerful explosion, ideal to get yourself out of trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe number one asset of \u00ab Frost \u00bb is his ability to teleport. By a simple push of a button, it is possible to create a ghost of Frost while still defending yourself. By letting go of that same button \u00ab Frost \u00bb teleports to the ghost's location.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat technology allows you to move faster, to dodge overwhelming shots but also to gain acces to unaccessable zones.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTeleportation needs practice, but once mastered \u00ab Frost \u00bb becomes so much harder to destroy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/638/63824b0171bf6bdca4af1a294a946412.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Storybird", "Julien Rocca"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital", "Look At My Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
