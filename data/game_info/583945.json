For a long time he trained hard, now he is ready - are you too? Help the cat catch the thief and go with him on an exciting journey through 60 different challenging levels.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that cats only have 9 lives. If you collect enough tiger coins, you can buy new lives on the death muffin in case of emergency. So always keep an eye on your coins and lives, otherwise your journey will end quicker than you thought and you will have to start from scratch...</p>\n\n<p>Good luck and enjoy :-)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T01:36:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa03422dafcc57bb2bc5539ca5b3401.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 343, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Boxx Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
