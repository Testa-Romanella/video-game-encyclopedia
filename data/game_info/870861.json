The team is art-oriented and each member has their unique talents. During the development,\u00a0there were a total of 5 members who worked on this project Lan, the Art lead; Nova, the Illustrator; Henry, the writer; and I, the producer. Sadie was a huge help in the early stages of development but unfortunately left during mid development.</p>\n<p>Overall this was a fun project to work on, it granted me insight into Unity's 2D game-making.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T12:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/6183679b782f98fb0b99321fc6659614.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yiyi HE"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
