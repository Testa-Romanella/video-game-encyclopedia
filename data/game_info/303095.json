It can be used to get a general idea of what it would be like to play streamed games with a certain latency, for example</p>\n<p>We have yet to know what the typical network latencies will be like for game streaming platforms, but around 80-120ms would be a good initial guess. So you can start by entering 100 in the \"InputLagMs\" field and see the difference it makes.</p>\n<p>Directions:</p>\n<ul><li>Press Escape key to toggle mouse cursor activation and game controls activation</li><li>With mouse cursor activated click on the input fields in the top left to set desired input lag milliseconds value and framerate cap value (0 is unlocked framerate)</li><li>Press enter to make sure the value you entered is applied</li><li>When values are set,\u00a0press Escape again to return to game</li><li>During the game you can shoot at the red spheres</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WSAD: move</li><li>Space: jump</li><li>Left mouse click: shoot</li><li>Escape: toggle cursor activation</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T02:40:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85a54c01d14884b7092b13141585e34c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phil_SA"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
