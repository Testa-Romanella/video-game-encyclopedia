{"id": 49943, "slug": "wild-rts", "name": "Wild RTS", "name_original": "Wild RTS", "description": "This classic RTS tells a story about the war between native Indians and European colonists. These two very different sides oppose each other over the course of many missions and campaigns. At this moment the first campaign is being in development in which you'll be able to play both as palefaces and redskins. An element of strategy is present - without careful resource management, necessary investments and tactical approach combat you'll have a hard time trying to go through the game. Micromanagement fans won't be disappointed: lots of active abilities, spy ops and unit microcontrol will play a large role in determining the outcome of any given fight and the battle as a whole.<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a77/a77ab4ac5353331a41044295f41d4f44.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/Atriagames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MyDreamForever"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atriagames"], "esrb_rating": null}
