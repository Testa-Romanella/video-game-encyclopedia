The first one was made to give you a tutorial and explain you how battles work, to introduce you the main characters and let you explore the headquarters. The next 4 chapters are focused on understanding to which race the main character actually belongs to; during these chapters, you aren't allowed to travel around the map, you're forced to follow the story, which is still plenty of things to do; during this time, you can also talk to other characters, ask them about their past, and play as them during flashbacks. The last 4 chapters are focused on winning the war; after the end of the 5th chapter, the game will become an actual openmap videogame, allowing you to explore almost everything of the map. The first half of the game is good, but the second half, in my view, is what makes this game worth its price.</p>\r\nWhy should you buy it?\u00a0\r\n<p>Because I've been working at it for 2 years and half. It's full of details; your actions and words may have some minor consequences in some cases; some side quests have different endings and paths, it depends on how much you've played the story and on which characters you bring along with you.</p>\r\n\r\nCommands:\r\n<ul><li>Key arrows to move;\r\n</li><li>SHIFT to run;\r\n</li><li>ENTER to select and analyze things;\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\r\nScripts:\r\n<ul><li>Victor Engine - Victor Sant\r\n</li><li>Hime - Himeworks (http://himeworks.com)\r\n</li><li>Dreadwing93\r\n</li><li>SumRndmDde - http://sumrndm.site/\r\n</li><li>Yanfly Engine Plugins\r\n</li><li>Heartbreak61\r\n</li><li>Mr. Trivel\r\n</li><li>Daimonious Tails - Vlue\r\n</li><li>Fallen Angel Olivia\r\n</li><li>Grizzo\r\n</li><li>Zalerinian</li></ul>\r\nWarning:\r\n<p>This game will definitely have updates.</p>\n<p>Some places may still be inacessible.</p>\n<p>Some side dialogues may still be locked.</p>\n<p>A quest is not complete yet, but playable.</p>\n<p>Even so, you'll be able to reach the end of the game and enjoy this gaming experience at its fullest.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd9/fd904cd9a45bfea611132a80141716d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Gheimz"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
