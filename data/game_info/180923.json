As there are up to four exits from each grid cell, there are fifteen different exit combinations (and one with no exits, which is not featured in game).</p>\n<p>Borrowing a page from Spelunky, each cell then randomly chooses a predefined 16 by 16 tile layout with proper exit combination. There currently are four different choices to pick from. Every other cell is forced to choose a layout with two side exits to enforce connectivity across the cave.<br/></p>\n<p>Each predefined layout also has set spawnpoints for monsters, treasure and oxygen tanks, with varied percentage chances to spawn (oxygen has low spawn chance).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Code, graphics, sound effects by: HardCodedValue.</li><li>Music: Alexandr Zhelanov (https://soundcloud.com/alexandr-zhelanov) licensed under CC-BY 4.0.</li><li>Made with GameMaker: Studio 1.4.</li><li>Sound effects made with JFXR.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27b/27b7fa574a29c65f3a38238e45b7a6cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HardCodedValue"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
