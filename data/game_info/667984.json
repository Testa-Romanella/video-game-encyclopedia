It's meant to be a testing ground for combat and movement mechanics, graphics tech, and general gameplay systems.\u00a0As I begin constructing the full game, I will add more enemies, abilities, and level features to this MVP.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the game will be a run-and-gun platforming adventure that tells a short story. For now, this demo is a self-contained version of everything I've made so far.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0move with WASD, jump/double-jump with Space, aim and shoot with mouse.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 when you enter the arena, enemies will begin to spawn in waves.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 each wave increases in size until wave 6, then it's constant forever.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 you have 3 spells at the moment: Bolt, Seekers, and Shell. Each has it's merits. swap with Q and E, there's an indicator in the prototype HUD in the top left.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 you can perform a dash attack with LShift which stuns enemies and deals some damage. The cooldown is indicated by a coin that returns to you from your original location.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 there is no score, you cannot die.</p>\n<p><em>Pause menu:</em></p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 pause the game with Esc</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 saving and loading does nothing.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 you can turn on music if you like, it's just a loop from one of my recent songs. it's not exactly mixed for this purpose, but I was using it to set the sound effect levels.</p>\n<p><em>Developer Controls</em></p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 if you turn this on, you get some extra controls:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 mouse wheel: control the darkness parameter of the lighting system (there is no indicator, press restart to restore default value)</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 &lt; and &gt; : slow time to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 the usual rate. There is no indicator, but it's clamped between 1/16 and 1 so you can just mash &gt; to get back to normal.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 P: not terribly useful to you, but holding P will play a test tone at full volume.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 \u00a0 R: shortcut for restarting the room. restarting restores the initial state of the game, so dev controls will be turned off again.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p>\n<p>Let me know what your initial impressions are.\u00a0Would you change anything about the movement, aiming, or spells?\u00a0I can easily adjust everything, It's just that I've been playing with these settings for months and I'm basically blind to it at this point.</p>\n<p>Also, If you run into any bugs or crashes, let me know. Here are some issues I'm aware of already:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0sticky platforms for enemies and debris</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0pathfinding glitch that causes flyers to exit at a high speed</p>\n\n<p>That's all for now, comment what you think, and if you have any questions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T04:38:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c55ba71b4fef3cd97f9e4f895e3c0f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LemonChampion"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
