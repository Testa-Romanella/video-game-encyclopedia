MU was at one time a magnificent, glorious, and powerful empire which no one ever could have foreseen it's collapse. It was a place of government and order. Sadly, it's people began to turn on their own government and began overwhelming the empire's armed forces with violent attacks and destruction of cities. As power hungry warmongers weakened the empire, another even more devastating threat appeared: Kundun's Resurrection.<br/></p>\n<p> \t\t\t\tLong, long ago, before MU had even been established into civilization, there was an evil beast which ruled over the continent. The beast was known as Kundun, the Devil of Darkness. Kundun was sealed away by ancient monks using the power of 10 Sealing Stones. These Sealing Stones were then scattered all across the continent in order to ensure that Kundun's Seal would never be broken. These monks also had written a prophecy which foretold an inevitable event of the future. Their prophecy turned all too true when the warmongers stole all 10 Sealing Stones and resurrected Kundun from his long rest. \t\t\t\r\n  \t\t\t</p>\n<p> \t\t\t\tThe seal was broken by a group of evil sorcerers who used deceiving behavior to manipulate warmongers into doing their dirty work. Through lies and deceit, lust and control, the sorcerers successfully resurrected Kundun and overthrew the entire empire of MU. \t\t\t\r\n  \t\t\t</p>\n<p> \t\t\t\tNow, Kundun once again rules over the continent summoning monsters which control the majority of the continent. Many cities were destroyed and many people were slain. Bands of heros have formed together to take control of at least a handful of the cities which still remain standing. These remaining cities are known as Lorencia, Devias, and Noria. There are a handful of civilians still trying their best to continue life in the ruin of their once mighty empire. The civilians need constant help from brave heroes\u00a0to continue guarding what is left of the empire, and to fulfill dangerous quests or journeys to continue civilization as they once knew it.\u00a0 \t\t\t\r\n  \t\t\t</p>\n<p> \t\t\t\tBrave heroes must come together and fight to seal away Kundun once more, and forever! The adventure starts by finding those sacred Sealing Stones which are under possession of warmongers... \t\t\t\r\n \t\t\r\n \t\r\n \t   </p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p> <em><strong>Media...</strong></em> </p>\n<br/>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p> <em><strong>Current State...</strong></em> </p>\n<p> \tIn its current state there are lots of game features to enjoy at the moment.   </p>\n<ul> <li> \t\tCharacter Classes: Knight \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tMain maps: Lorencia \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tSimple Tutorial Quests to walk you through some game features. \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tEquipment upgrade system. \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tEquipment transformation system to obtain powerful items with\u00a0special rarity options. \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tEquipment and item crafting. \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tDaily lairs to hunt special boss monsters. \t\r\n </li></ul>\n<p> \t\u00a0   </p>\n<p> <em><strong>Reaching a Beta Phase and Our Future plans...</strong></em> </p>\n<p> \tOur goal is to create a great PVP focused online RPG game. We are currently in a heavy Alpha stage of game development and have many features to add and develop. However, we feel we have reached a point of development where the game has a great base to continue building on. The main storyline and quest board is essentially non-existent\u00a0at this point. Because the game is going to be PVP focused, out story and quest boards are going to be quite general. While there will be a story to follow as your character progresses, it will not be the entire focus of the game. There will not necessarily\u00a0be an end-point in the game as we will focus to build on the end-game with intense PVP focused updates, mini-games, and events to participate in as players approach maximum character level.\u00a0   </p>\n<p> \t\u00a0   </p>\n<p> \tWe are currently in an Open Alpha development phase and have plans to at least complete the following before we enter any kind of beta phase:   </p>\n<ul> <li> \t\tCreate an Elf class that uses Range style weapons such as Bow and Arrow, or throwing knives. \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tCreate a Mage class that only uses magic spells. \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tCreate 2 additional main world maps (Noria - Elven Forest, Devias - Iceplain \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tCreate 2 PVP focused mini-games that happen at certain times of the day. \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tCreate a PVP ranking and reward system. \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tCreate a PVP focused Guild ranking and reward system. \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tCreate a character customization system \t\r\n \t</li><li> \t\tCreate a PVE focused quest and story board following the Introduction Story. \t\r\n </li></ul>\n<p> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:03:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/535dadbc582461564cb0722d20f27304.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["izakt"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
