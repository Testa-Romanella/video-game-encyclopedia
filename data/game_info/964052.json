{"id": 964052, "slug": "lets-school", "name": "Let's School", "name_original": "Let's School", "description": "In Let\u2019s School, you take on the role of a principal tasked with the challenge of revamping and managing your alma mater! The game features two core mechanics: the construction and designing of the school and managing the dynamics of students and teachers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each student has unique interests and aspirations, making your role as headmaster more complex. Balancing factors like your school's reputation, satisfying students' basic needs, overseeing academic pressure, and managing aspects like clothing, food, and travel provide an immersive and challenging experience. Aside from the usual responsibilities of a headmaster, you are also tasked with managing various issues that originate outside the school, including mysterious dangers and potential threats that might cause things to go bananas!<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>The architectural design of the school is a blank canvas for the player. With the freedom to plan and construct various functional facilities and access to hundreds of educational equipment, you define your institution's aesthetic and practical landscape. Don't limit yourself to horizontal expansion - think vertically by constructing multi-story buildings for more innovative developments or even eccentric structures!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The fate of teachers and students lies in your hands. The recruitment process, teaching methodologies, and personal growth of teachers and students rest on your decisions. Enhancing the skills of your teachers opens up opportunities for them in different roles. You can influence student morale and academic performance by offering elective courses, thereby shaping their future life paths.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The management of school discipline is another crucial responsibility. Be mindful of the impact of school facilities on student morale, and beware of signs of student distress. Overeating in the canteen could lead to weight gain, while an increase in eyeglass usage could signal excessive stress. Proper access to sanitary facilities is vital, as a lack thereof may lead to widespread anxiety and misuse of the school premises.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To maintain discipline, monitor for contraband among students and establish an effective punishment system. Handling real-time crises such as truancy, bullying, and questioning also falls within your responsibilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fostering a balanced school environment through field days, morning exercises, and various events could help students regulate their emotions. Let\u2019s School is a game of management, strategy, and decision-making, where every choice you make has far-reaching consequences!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T20:16:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4c6e30bb14601b1285b8e3f5075736.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 13, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 3, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pathea Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pathea Games", "PM Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
