The game takes place in a mining site located inside a volcano, after a series of killings has left the place abandoned. Trapped, you must find a way to escape while a shapeshifting quantum monster lurks in the dark.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Find all four codes and then make it to the elevator while avoiding the monster. Being in darkness will change your position. The Heart Rate monitor shows the status of your quantum selves. If one dies, you can use the teleporter button in the central chamber to change the floor you're on.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Duncan Armstrong - Programming &amp; Sound<br/>Ethan Adams - Design, Art, &amp; Sound<br/>Abigail Rivera - Logo<br/></p>\n<p>Made as part of the Clark University 2022 Spooky Jam</p>\n\n<p><strong>Misc.
