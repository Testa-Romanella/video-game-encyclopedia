While wandering the cosmos, he spills his StellarSoda\u2122 on his dashboard and one thing leads to another until he finds himself barrelling towards a floating island world, home to Blueman. Being the magnificent pilot he is, Astroguy takes control and gently lands on Blueman's island, leaving a crater, a busted ship and smoke coming from a lot of places it shouldn't be. Unfortunately for Blueman, his tower had been invaded by local pests. With the two of them conveniently having met, they quickly strike a deal, where Astroguy will clear the tower of enemies in exchange for Blueman fixing the ship up.<br/></p>\n<p>Drkr - Programming</p>\n<p>appl3 - Voxel Artist<br/></p>\n<p>KSYNHC - Music</p>\n<p>Nik - Sound Effects and moral support<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/813/8133dbb79778dba79717aa64bd2dbe70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Drkr"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
