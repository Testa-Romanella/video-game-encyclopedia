There is a man, walking alone through the monster-infested forests of Midland. He bears only tattered brown rags, an old knife, and a message he was tasked with delivering. In this decaying world, a messenger's work is something to be treasured...<br/><br/>Fadry is a linear, story-focused game which explores a meticulously crafted dark fantasy world through the eyes of several different characters.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Decisions impacting the story</li></ul>This game is <strong>very</strong> demanding when it comes to the player's attention. Characters will lie and mislead you. History books are biased. You will need to seek out information on your own initiative and analyze it all carefully before you make your decisions, there will be quite a few of them. No in-game source is infallible. <strong>Don't expect complete answers to come to you on a silver platter.</strong><br/><ul><li>Challenging turn-based combat</li></ul>You are not some chosen one. If you want to survive, you'll need to use wit and knowledge to best your opponents.<br/><br/><br/>Note that Fadry is currently in early access, and only features the first 2 of 4 total Chapters. (Meaning it currently has about 10 hours of content.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T03:52:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ef/4efcc19de0fcbdd8ba93a09cc8944fbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lucy", "Lucy of Bohemia"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lucy of Bohemia"], "esrb_rating": null}
