{"id": 950462, "slug": "tomorrow-forever", "name": "TOMORROW FOREVER", "name_original": "TOMORROW FOREVER", "description": "Welcome!\r\n<p>Welcome to TOMORROW FOREVER,  a co-operative sci-fi gadgeteering heist game and outlaw sandbox about striking back against the powers of a dystopian future.</p>\n<p>Players will be able to utilize a wide variety of gadgets, vehicles, hacks, and tricks to steal, sabotage, and generally wreck havoc.</p>\n<p>The game comes first, but there is also a Youtube channel that you can expect to see more and more content on in the next few weeks. The game is in alpha and lacking some tutorialization, so feel free to subscribe to the Youtube to learn more,<br/></p>\r\nThe World\r\n<p>TOMORROW FOREVER is set on Saydo. This tiny planetoid is undergoing a massive terraforming and rebuilding process after a battle 25 years ago laid waste to the majestic mausoleum that once was. The largest wrecked ships of the Parliamentary Navy have all been cordoned off, with no one, not even the Saydo Department of Security allowed inside.</p>\n<p>This of course has made them a haven for fugitives of all types, and the cradle of the next revolution. You have the good fortune to have made it to The Triplets, the most populated of the the sacred wrecksites, and you've even managed to get yourself calibrated to one of the old emergency recall harnesses.</p>\n<p>There are gates on Saydo that lead between worlds, and in time, you will pass through them. How many worlds you reach is anyone's guess.<br/></p>\r\nThe Toys\r\n<p>TOMORROW FOREVER has five different vehicles, all of which can be piloted from first person by one more people. You don't become the vehicle, you sit down in it and your character manipulates the controls.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are 28 handheld tools and gadgets and counting! We've got a welding torch, a few teleporters, an umbrella, some handheld thrusters, a bunch of guns and rocket launchers, some advanced sensor tech, and even a few drones to play around with!</p>\n<p>That's not even counting the 16 customizable vehicle mounted tools, or the variety of other devices that can be hacked and co-opted along the way!<br/></p>\r\nThe Missions\r\n<p>There are currently four mission types in the game, with several more coming very soon! The missions are generally meant to be extremely varied and replayable. All levels are procedurally generated, and as time goes on more and more dimensions of variation will be added. Planned variations include different security companies, different planets, and different weather conditions.</p>\r\nThe Future\r\n<p>TOMORROW FOREVER is in alpha, and is being actively developed, with plans to reach a beta state in 2024, and a level of polish that could be called \"done\" in 2025. That said, I love long term projects and I would love to continue to support and develop this game for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Our community Discord is generally the best place to keep in touch and learn about what's coming down the pipe. Come join us!</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/p76r8JUt8R</p>\r\nSupporting Development\r\n<p>TOMORROW FOREVER is the product of a solo developer supported by a community. The game is free, but a lot of effort goes into making it. Please consider supporting development through any or all of the following methods, every bit is appreciated, and every bit helps the game to grow into its best self! I cannot do this alone!</p>\n<ul><li>Giving feedback and criticism in-game via the F1 key</li><li>Giving feedback and criticism via any social media.</li><li>Sharing the game with friends</li><li>Contributing via the Itch.io page.</li><li>Supporting the game on Patreon</li></ul>\n<p>TOMORROW FOREVER is being released for free now due to being in alpha. I would strongly prefer that the game remain free as a community supported project.</p>\r\nControls\r\nOn Foot\r\n<p>TOMORROW FOREVER uses typical first person controls for the most part.</p>\n<p>WASD: Moves your character.</p>\n<p>Mouse Movement: Looks around<br/></p>\n<p>Space Bar: Jumps<br/></p>\n<p>Shift: Sprints</p>\n<p>Control: Crouches</p>\n<p>X: E<strong>x</strong>its the current seat.</p>\n<p>C: Opens up the <strong>C</strong>yberplexus menu, in which you can chat on and select between networks that you have access to.</p>\n<p>N: Opens the <strong>N</strong>avigation menu, in which you can mark different destinations that you have been to before.<br/></p>\n<p>1-4: Selects the handheld tool in the given slot.</p>\n<p>Hold Right Click to ready a handheld tool, and left click to activate it.<br/></p>\n<p>Many devices can be used in the world by left clicking on them when you have no handheld tool readied.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Note: There is no need to reload weapons with new clips/magazines as you might be used to, as they are integrated into your suit or ship.
