This was made to run in Eclipse's console mainly. I wanted to make it as simple as possible, so I made this program to run in only one class and only use one-dimensional arrays. This may not resemble an actual database, but this could be considered a database simulation in the sense that it stores information, namely in slots. This took me about an hour to code. Feel free to edit it if you wish.</p><p>---------<br/></p><p>I must point out that you will need Eclipse or some Java IDE to open this (preferably Eclipse, since that's what I developed this program on).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2e2b7c876a26f209d08f7ba99663a24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["eddiecibotaru"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
