Play Cards\r\n<p>Play a card by selecting the card along the bottom of the grid. Click on the circles on the grid to play it. You must play two cards every turn.</p>\r\n2. Dodge Asteroids\r\n<p>Asteroids will move their speed value (the number on the asteroid) each turn after you play your\u00a0cards. Running into asteroids will kill you. Asteroids running into you will kill you.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n3. Recycle Duds\r\n<p>Each turn you can recycle one card.
