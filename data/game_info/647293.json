This project was created during February of that year.</p>\n<p>After pong I wanted to make something a bit more mechanically interesting, since I would have a bit of extra off-time. I wanted to learn more about Unity ECS (specifically Hybrid ECS), so I focused on becoming acquainted with that. I also did a bit more modeling in Blender and added more sounds. I ended up taking a deeper dive into Shader Graph and VFX graph this time around - creating a customizable shader for the planet, orbits, and atmosphere.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T07:06:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d95632ff6043c27d825df48ad6e6ab1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard Stack"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
