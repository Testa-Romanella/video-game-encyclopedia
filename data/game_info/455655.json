It takes whatever source material you give it, combines all the words, and then creates new titles and stories. At present, most of it doesn't make sense...but it's eerie and delightful when sentences do start to coalesce! I am planning on putting the source code on Github so that anyone can use the Library of Forking Paths.</p>\n<p>Here's a list of source literature in this web build:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Selections from the Mahabharata (a Sanskrit epic)</li><li>the Theogony (a Greek creation story)</li><li>Selections from the Epic of Gilgamesh (a Sumerian epic/the earliest surviving work of great literature)</li><li>the Popol Vuh (a K'iche' creation story)</li><li>Selections from the Epic of Sundiata (a Malinke epic)</li></ul>\n<p><em>The Library of Forking Paths was created as part of an MFA thesis project that ultimately got scrapped. This book generator was one of the assets I was tasked with making, but others contributed to its development: Mary Georgescu (design), Connor Carson (programming), Palmmy Sivarapornsakul (art and UI), and the code help desk at NYU's Game Center.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T02:37:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/5664f6a42913b937ad2a067d5d837709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ElizabethBallou"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
