{"id": 167582, "slug": "too-fast-too-flirtatious", "name": "Too Fast Too Flirtatious", "name_original": "Too Fast Too Flirtatious", "description": "<p>Are you flirtatious enough? Are you fast enough? Can you obtain the phone numbers of all of these characters? Are you socially competent/manipulative enough to attract the diverse array of people during your speed dating endeavors? We're definitely not! So, we made\u00a0 a game to pretend we were efficient and charming. Go on dates with interesting, underdeveloped 'characters'. But beware, choose your words carefully or you'll be judged(just like we are on a daily basis - which is why we chose game development).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As game developers, we, or at least I (I'm Rajas, the guy writing this description) know how difficult dating (and intimate relationships of any sort) can be - so we tried to emulate what dating is like for the common individual. For me at least, my thoughts and words are constantly floating around in an erratic, jumbled up manner, which explains why I\u00a0may sometimes say nonsensical or insensitive things(now ya get it Sasha/Cathy/Alexis/Rana/Kristine/Danielle/Shauna?!). Through this game, we hope to shed light on the weirder aspects of overly-structured, rule-based systems of dating - and the confusion that comes along with it. Enjoy your dates!<br/></p>\n<p>By:</p>\n<p>William Pheloung</p>\n<p>Rob Bishop</p>\n<p>Rajas Nagpurkar</p>\n<p>Terrence Pharrel<br/></p>\n<p>Leo Antelys</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42e/42eff73e49cbcc43d3c8800685b98c79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["keyboardkommander"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
