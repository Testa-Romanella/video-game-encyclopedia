The ocean level is rising every night\u00a0and you must build a structure to stay dry.<br/></p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Mudflat is a physics based\u00a0 simulation game where you stack and weld objects in order to avoid the ever increasing tide. During the day while the tide is low you can pick up and weld objects into a structure. At night when the tide rises, you can use this tower to stay dry. The tide marker shows you how high the tide will be each night so that you can plan accordingly.</p>\r\nInstallation\r\n<p>Just unzip and run Mudflat.exe</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>* <strong>Look</strong>: Mouse/Right stick<br/>* <strong>Move</strong>: WASD/Left stick<br/>* <strong>Jump</strong>: Space/A button<br/>* <strong>Inspect</strong>: Left Click/Right Trigger<br/>* <strong>Pick up and move/drag focused object</strong>: Hold left click/right trigger<br/>* <strong>Weld held/focused object to all objects it touches</strong>: Right click/Left trigger<br/>* <strong>Delete all welds on held/focused object</strong>: Right click/Left Trigger</p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>* You must survive for 10 days total\u00a0(there is no saving of your game)<br/>* Use the water meter to make sure your structure is high enough for the next night<br/>* Welding objects together increases the stability of your structures and allows you to move multiple objects as a unit.<br/>* Heavier objects don't move as easily but you can still drag them around<br/>* Pay attention to the time of day (sky color)\u00a0so that you know when to get to higher ground</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:53:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/921a17b19948dde96a682a62ff96fa18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["morphinegames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
