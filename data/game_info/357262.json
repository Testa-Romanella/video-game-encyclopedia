Instead we decided\u00a0 to further develop to a full game adding a node system for cinematics and boss AI, simple joint based animation for bosses and the commander ship. Three bosses and six levels were developed with increasing difficulty. Leda is one of Jupiter's moons. Res refers to rescue, thus the game name. Started before and finished after our other html pixel art game Stealth Doggo.<br/></p>\n<p>Adheres to our fictional mid 80s 8bit hardware spec \"Paca System 8\" supporting 2 background scroll planes, 2 foreground planes (max 32 sprites), 4 colors, maximum resolution of 192x128, and 4 way polyphonic FM synthesis.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76d4c4f6731ea4284da22a9b09639706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alpaca Space Lab"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
