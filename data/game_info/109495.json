The physics are totally out of this world!</p>\n<p>You can shoot the targets and do jumps to knock them off. The bike also has time travel ability when you press T, but as of now with the game really not being complete at all with the plot and stuff if will just teleport you up to a high ramp right now. Very much a work in progress</p>\n<p>The Banner is a silly thing about the plot of the game and isnt really much to do with this. Still Fairly broken, bare with us as we fix simple problems.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/226/22604c32c92ef1e87d1e51896d9d0e79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BoltMan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
