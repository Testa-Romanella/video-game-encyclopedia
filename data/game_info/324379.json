Each player has nine pieces, or \"men\", which move among the board's twenty-four spots. The object of the game is to leave the opposing player with fewer than three pieces or, as in checkers, no legal moves. A number of variants of the game exist, including 12-Mens Morris, Shax (Somalian) and Square Chess (from northwest China and Xinjiang).<br/><br/>The aim of the project is to implement a version of Nine Mens Morris on an iPad, allowing two players to take turns in playing the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T03:37:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/9571fdca98027637ca32638a87373e34.jpg", "website": "http://www.59186618.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Yi Min Shen"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Yi Min Shen"], "esrb_rating": null}
