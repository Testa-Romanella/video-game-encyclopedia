Over 40 levels, 40 unique molecules, countless atoms, spin plates, triggers and fun facts about science are waiting!  But beware, this puzzle game isn\u2019t easy. You\u2019ll need to get your brain into gear to successfully solve these levels. <br/><br/>Created by visual effects artist of multi-award winning film \u2018Gravity\u2019 and \u2018Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u2019, Molecule\u2019s game design is unexpectedly simple. With retro-inspired graphics and demanding riddles, this game will transport you back to the \u2018golden age of video games\u2019. <br/><br/>\u201cGames should be hard. The whole grown up life thing is. Why should a game be different? Something fun isn\u2019t fun because it\u2019s easy, but because it offers a sense of reward for an attainable achievement. We don\u2019t look back to the beginning of computer games because we could finish them all in one sitting. We get captivated by nostalgia about spending, days, nights, weeks stuck on the same boss, with friends, in the dark. An easy win is not an adventure, and adventures is what we want to remember.\u201d<br/>- Johannes Richter, Game Designer", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/625305a7d65b0c8d233b71914342d77e.jpg", "website": "http://www.amightydish.com/molecule", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 32, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["a.mighty.dish"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["a.mighty.dish"], "esrb_rating": null}
