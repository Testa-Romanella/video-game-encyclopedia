This is why INCU (International Nazi Crime Unit) has been established with one and only specific goal in mind: to find them and get them back for a fair trial.<br/><br/>You will assume the role of officer who is looking for a distinct group of scoundrels. Every member of this group once used to be on staff at the most notorious concentration camp sadly known as \u00abAshland\u00bb. In the past all of them committed extremely heinous crimes and now it is time to answer for it.<h3>Key game features</h3><ul><li>Tense operations undertaken for pinpointing and extracting a suspect.</li></ul><ul><li>Rich lore and backstory of the unfolding events.</li></ul><ul><li>Scrupulous analyzing of intel, evidence and witnesses\u2019 testimonies.</li></ul><ul><li>Two playable timelines: 1965 and 1941-1945. </li></ul><ul><li>Heavy emphasis on making sure criminals get the maximum potential sentence. </li></ul><ul><li>Deep and realistic look into the daily concentration camp functioning.</li></ul><ul><li>Searching for all available means that could help save as many fellow inmates as possible.</li></ul><h3>Operations</h3>In order to bring your targets down you will have to utilize both cunning and brute force.

They were once lucky enough to survive the deadly grasp of Ashland and now they are willing to contribute in catching their past tormentors.<h3>Evidence</h3>Not all the work is done strictly in the field. A good part of it is done at the office where you are going to analyze the intel and pass it further on to authorities. The indictment and hence the sentencing, will be based on what proof you managed to prepare.<h3>World</h3>It is 1965 and another wretched Chimera is about to surface \u2014 Vietnam conflict. The Cold War is also at its peak, so the international attention is drawn away from the past. No one wants to remember what had happened 20 years ago and quite a few people for certain reasons want it to remain this way. That is exactly why you should expect some hostile attitude even today.<br/><br/><br/>It is perfectly clear that no crime should ever be forgotten. Especially if it is a crime against humanity. And a just punishment for all those involved will serve as an example for future generations.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T02:37:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01b/01b6ee2c02a90b78b22ccedbf0b79b28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 18, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PsyRob"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PsyRob"], "esrb_rating": null}
