As you begin your reign of terror on the lazy river, you notice the park employees handing something to every rider except you. Are those\u2026 darts?</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<ul><li>Use the arrow keys or WASD to swim. The river current is pushing you along, too- don\u2019t expect to get anywhere if you\u2019re swimming against the current.</li><li>Click in any direction to slash your pocket knife in that direction.</li><li>Slash everyone else\u2019s inner tubes to win!</li><li>Don\u2019t get hit by the darts being thrown at you- you can dodge them, or you can slash them out of the air!</li></ul>\n<p>All art, audio, and code made by Birdwards within 48 hours for Ludum Dare 47.
