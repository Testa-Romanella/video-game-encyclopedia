It's not a big twist, it's true, actually it seems that cleaning while being an unicorn is easier than anything...</p>\n<p>Anyway, enjoy a cleaning experience like never before! Call the post lady, Delpo, to the rescue and get delivered tons of buckets, containers, and buckets! Put your trash in containers and send them to god knows where with the help of your friend Delpo yet again! Use your powerful mop to clean <strong>puddles</strong>! That's right, the game is named after those very same things!</p>\n<p>Puddle is our very first serious project after participating to a game jam (posted on one of our dudes account here on itch: here). It took us way, way too much time to finish it - almost 2 years - but we did learned one or two things along the way and are very proud to finally let it come out! We hope you can have some enjoyement out of it!</p>\n<p><em>Yours truly, three french baguettes getting ready to empty three hydromel bottles.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad2/ad276df1cd0b37dfd47387def50a57cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Astaroth Studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
