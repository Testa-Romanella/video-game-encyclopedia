{"id": 14690, "slug": "trine-enchanted-edition", "name": "Trine Enchanted Edition", "name_original": "Trine Enchanted Edition", "description": "<p>The king died and did not leave an heir, the kingdom fell into civil strife, the land in response to lawlessness and disorder brought to the surface hordes of monsters, increasing chaos.<br />\nThe magician, knight and thief were united by fate for the struggle for peace and the restoration of the kingdom. Alone and together they fight with enemies, solve puzzles and overcome obstacles on fifteen different levels. Decisions can be more than one, and they can be composed of the skills of all three players.<br />\nExquisite, delicate drawing of the world and characters. Very elegant, subtle, very realistic sounds - yes, realistic sounds of the magic world. That&#39;s precisely the way it should be. But when the hero breaks the wall with a ram or stumbles upon a mountain of treasures - the battering ram sounds like a battering ram, and the mountain is imposing. Very cleverly put light makes the world deep, voluminous and alive. Passing the game, you do not want to rush, you want to consider, to discover all its details, to admire them for your pleasure.<br />\nThe game supports 3D mode, you need a suitable TV and stereoscopic glasses.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2009-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:27:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e0f/e0f05a97ff926acf4c8f43e0849b6832.jpg", "website": "http://www.trine-thegame.com/", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 210, "owned": 4222, "beaten": 451, "toplay": 55, "dropped": 201, "playing": 23}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 209, "ratings_count": 713, "suggestions_count": 498, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 721, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Frozenbyte"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Frozenbyte"], "esrb_rating": null}
