But you will still be playing phase 1-4.</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>-The coins serve to gain time (not points). Collect as many coins as possible and take them to a black block with a coin.<br/>-Some blocks can only be destroyed with bombs or fire.<br/>-After capturing the 4 civilians of each phase, take them to a block written \"GOAL\" (these blocks lead to some alternate paths).<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0 SNK (Neo Bomberman)</p>\n<p>sound effects: Juhani Junkala\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Sprites: Kenney  (https://www.kenney.nl/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T08:56:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f55c5515026237980033b19f32e3375.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gear Games Dev"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
