Starting from awakening people's pursuit of freedom, we have made a game that combines rhythm and RPG, allowing them to feel the cruelty of the class system and the pain of being imprisoned for freedom while playing the game for leisure and relaxation, so that they can pursue freedom more bravely in reality. Users need a computer to play this game, the system supports Windows and Mac.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T05:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b58/b58f472b5963d56986026dc2722a5bd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jenny2"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
