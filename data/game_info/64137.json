One day the zone goes full paranormal \u2013 with you inside. Surrounded by dangerous anomalies and hunted by monsters during the night, you have to decide whether to fight, or flee and pray for dawn.EXPLORE, DISCOVER, SURVIVE.Departure takes place in a large forest full of interesting places and seriously weird shit to discover. You can go wherever and do whatever but be aware that the potent storyline will find you no matter what. And most likely it will be a violent encounter.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>During the night you try to survive and solve the mystery of this place. During the day you gather necessary items and supplies, taking advantage of the fact that there are no monsters around. Aside from weapons, you have a drone at your disposal. Use it wisely.TPP WITH MOVIE-STYLE CAMERA WORK.Inspired by the first Silent Hill game, Departure is rich in a branching storyline told through the game\u2019s world and events. It\u2019s not a book disguised as a game \u2013 rather it\u2019s an interactive movie full of dynamic camera shots. So stop reading and look at this trailer. Look at it!<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d56cd45e0088198fbef3f6ef0bef00ae.jpg", "website": "http://www.fatdoggames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RG Crew"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fat Dog Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
