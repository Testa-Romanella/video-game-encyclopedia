Wanted to see if I could create a primitive but custom-built engine for it to make a complete game! The game is built using JavaFX version 8.<br/><br/>The objective is to click on as many circles as you can. But be careful, some circles will contribute to your \"missed\" count instead! But they wont contribute if they leave the screen.\u00a0(Avoid the red ones, they don't like you much... those shifty circles...)<br/><br/>Music and sounds acquired from\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/\u00a0through his public domain licensed assets.<br/><br/><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong>:<br/>Click on as many circles as you can! Circles will get faster as your score increases.\u00a0Any circles that leave the screen contribute to your \"miss\" count, and clicks on red circles also count as a miss. Five misses ends the game, how many can you get?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/>ESCAPE - Exit fullscreen mode (no way of going back, unfortunately)</p>\n<p>P - Pause game (press P again to unpause)</p>\n<p>LEFT MOUSE - Click on a circle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T07:34:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac5/ac58068e4b7b33748f0861a44e5cffc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PocketNerd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
