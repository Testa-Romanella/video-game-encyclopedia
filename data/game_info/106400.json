It showcases a select number of game-play features, and serves as a proof-of-concept only. It is not meant for review, nor is it meant for sale or wide-scale distribution. It is unoptimised, incomplete, and may contain game-breaking bugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was quickly developed in three and a half weeks by a team of two in order to be presented as a Concept Prototype for both the upcoming <strong>Kickstarter</strong> and <strong>IndieGoGo</strong> campaigns for The Red Planet.</p>\n<p>Please support us on our Kickstarter Page, and we can take The Red Planet into full production as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Kira Zingmark - Designer &amp; Programmer</em></p>\n<p><em>Misty-Lee Lyons - Audio Engineer</em></p>\n<p><em>Eric Margolin - Composer</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>MUSIC:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em>Eric Margolin - \"Descent Into Darkness\"<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Eric Margolin - \u201cThe Mystery Unravels\u201d<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Eric Margolin is a gifted\u00a0American Composer.
