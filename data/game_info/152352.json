Beatriz Milhazes is a Brazilian artist with work that is exhibited worldwide. <br/><br/>Through this task I learned a lot (as was the intent of the task), mostly to do with process and accounting. Accounting for time taken and effort spent on completing elements of a game. <br/></p>\n<p>This incomplete little game is the fruit of learning. Enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Use the mouse to fire \"Ripples\" that will burst when they reach their target. Missiles will enter the screen and will be attracted to your placed targets also.<br/>Hit \"Enter/Return\" to take a screenshot that will be saved in the game folder.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e64/e64a4cd3ca0ef077013b83bd18472f95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VcPenguin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
