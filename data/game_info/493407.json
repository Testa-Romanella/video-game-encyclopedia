First blob to reach the finish line wins. <br/></p>\n<p>Well, at least that's what it was supposed to be. For now, use the green blob and try to get to the finish in the shortest time without opponents :). I'll update it as soon as I possible with all the remaining features.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Please click on the internal fullscreen button for proper resolution. Also, no sound yet. Sorry.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Arrow keys/ WASD<br/></p>\r\nMini Jam 62:\r\n<p>This game was made for Mini Jam 62 with the theme COLORS and a limitation of only 2 frames for animations.</p>\n<p>As per the limitation, all animations in the game consist of at most 2 frames only. The theme is incorporated through the main obstacle of the game, i.e. paintball turrets that switch color every few seconds. A blob gets stunned for a few seconds if a paintball of the same color as them hits them.</p>\n<p>Most assets were made by me during the Jam while the tilemap and some lobby decorations are from an earlier, un-published game.</p>\n<p>Please leave some feedback if you play :) .<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T16:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a6/5a6dd9600fcbba15f2e8914b87f4a574.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Renderererer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
