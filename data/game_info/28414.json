{"id": 28414, "slug": "fifa-12", "name": "FIFA 12", "name_original": "FIFA 12", "description": "<p>FIFA 12 is the nineteenth installment of the decades-spanning series of soccer simulators by Electronic Arts. It is based on the 2012 season.</p>\n<h3>Changes from the previous games</h3>\n<p>While FIFA 12 did not change the gameplay dramatically, the game includes several important updates. The most notable is Impact Engine that calculates procedurally generated collisions based on laws of physics. The engine takes into account the players&#39; stats as well as the speed and angle of the collision. This makes the game less predictable and more realistic. The engine also influences the injuries of the players. </p>\n<p>The game also introduces a new Tactical Defending system that gives the player more control over his or her defenses, and the Precision Dribbling option that allows the player to protect the ball while dribbling it. Another new feature is Pro Player Intelligence that makes the AI-controlled players take into account their teammates&#39; skills.</p>\n<h3>Teams</h3>\n<p>The game includes 29 national leagues and 42 national teams. Notably, however, both the Czech national team and league are absent, as well as several others that were present in FIFA 11. </p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game introduced Head to Head Seasons mode that offers the players to progress through the ten divisions during ten seasons of ten games each. A new system automatically pairs the players with similar preferences, such as manual control, against each other.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2011-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T21:56:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ab7/ab7fdd680a7008a14b5bd8d99c760925.jpg", "website": "http://www.ea.com/uk/football/", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 933, "beaten": 145, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 140, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 108, "ratings_count": 266, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 30, "reviews_count": 266, "platforms": ["Android", "PlayStation 3", "PC", "PSP", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox 360", "iOS"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts Canada", "HB Studios"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
