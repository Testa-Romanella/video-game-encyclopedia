The game was made with\u00a0Raycasting Game Maker, available at\u00a0https://www.moddb.com/engines/raycasting-game-maker\u00a0. Being made with an external engine,\u00a0the game has a few weird gimmicks, so make sure to read the in-game tutorial textwall.</p>\n<p>Have fun~<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T09:32:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/119acc8e5bffe618ce327082c1056d25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nnaa"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
