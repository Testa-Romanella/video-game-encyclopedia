The main idea behind the development was to make a thing in Unity3d and - completely solo (so, please, bear with designer/prototyper art).</p><strong>Rules</strong><p>This is a tactical 2-player hotseat:</p><ol><li><strong>every turn</strong> a player has a base of 5 unit moves, 1 unit attack and 1 tile move, which they use to manipulate their teams' units and field's tiles;</li><li><strong>units </strong>can be moved and ordered to attack other team's units;</li><li><strong>a tile</strong> can be lifted and lowered, which should be used for the tactical battle purposes (just try and see what you can get out of it);</li><li><strong>extra moves/attacks</strong> can be earned by placing the units on red (+1 unit attack) or green (+1 tile move) tiles \u2013 these are <em>dynamical</em> across the turn, so use it to your advantage, but remember you can't have more bonus than you have units;</li><li><strong>you win </strong>through exterminating the opponent's team. </li></ol><strong>Controls</strong><ul><li>use mouse for unit/tile/UI interactions;</li><li>use WASD/Arrows + mouse wheel for camera movement and zoom;</li><li>use R key for the reboot</li></ul><p><strong><em>Careful!</em></strong> The R key would reboot the game <em>instantly</em> without further confirmations! So only use it after your match is over or if you <em>really</em> hate the current map/match.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2c74d41add16131ae759a6e435082b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["protascenery"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
