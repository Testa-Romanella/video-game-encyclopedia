More content was planned, but I started the Azure jam a day late. I planned to include more scenes and elements in the existing scenes to tie the story together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The experience is missing key elements to convey its message, and as it stands I am not sure what shines through, if anything.. I spent a considerable amount of time on the assets, cut scenes, and animations; A great learning experience. I wish I could have put some more atmosphere into it, music, sounds, length of exploration, and environmental storytelling.<br/></p>\n<p>Overall it was a great experience, and was just the push I needed to take another step in learning the art of game design. I wish I would have started on time, looking forward to future jams.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:08:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e24/e243d8e3248fde86486ac07630de3138.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuenchGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
