Avoid cars and crashing into objects while drifting with 100mph speed. Do donuts to get extra points, but watch out, if you do it too much a bomb will drop and you need to get away from it. Earn coins and buy better looking cars. <br/></p>\n<p>If you're pro show us what you're made of in extreme mode. I bet you wont last for long. 1 Life, 1chance, no mistakes.</p>\n<p>Compete with others on the leaderboard. Or just pass time while you wait for the dentist, sit on the toilet, or sitting in a jam. Street rush is simple, but fun and addicting. Don't say i didn't warn you. So strap your seat-belt and jump in the chase and show who's the boss.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:04:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/280/280dbadbadacec6e71d75e53eaf89655.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skyleen"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
