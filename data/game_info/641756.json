The task is complicated by the fact that the main character wants to stop the fabulous creatures, they will do everything to stop the main character.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou get points for collecting coins. The levels are a kind of maze in which you need to maneuver in order not to get caught by enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMagic spheres will help to get out during the most critical situations - spheres make enemies vulnerable for a while. Thus, you can get out of seemingly hopeless situations.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBy building the path correctly, you will achieve your goal! Go ahead, Hero!
