You will need 5 six-sided dice per player, or simply type \"roll 5d6\" into Google as needed.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p><em>You are a cosmic space wizard. You have lived for thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of years, and will live for millennia\u00a0more. You have the power to, if you so choose, travel between planets and between dimensions. Your name may be known and revered by entire civilizations, or it may be something forbidden passed down in whispers and folktales from generation to generation.</em></p>\n<p><em>There are only a handful of wizards as powerful as you across the cosmos. One night, not long ago, each and every one of you all had the same dream. You dreamt that, at the end of time and the universe, only one of you will remain alive, standing at the precipice to the infinite gulf of nothingness. Whichever one of you remains will be the one to determine how the next universe is shaped.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Whether or not you have any desire to grow your power or destroy other wizards, you are now in extreme danger, marked as a target for extermination by every other wizard alive. Whether or not you have any desire to shape the next universe, you know for certain that there are beings far worse than you who, if left unabated, will take up this throne of power with only malevolence and chaos in mind.</em></p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>When playing as a single-player journaling game, you will either want to create multiple characters, or alternatively, you can refer to the master reference here where I am compiling all wizards I have made or have been shared with me. In your game, these other characters you introduce are the NPCs.\u00a0If you have a wizard you would like to submit to the document, please do share them with me; I'd be thrilled to read about them!
