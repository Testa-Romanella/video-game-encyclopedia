{"id": 371727, "slug": "gerbil-peril", "name": "Gerbil Peril!", "name_original": "Gerbil Peril!", "description": "<p>Gerbil Peril! is loosely based on the classic Lemmings game produced by Psygnosis. The majority of the game will involve having to draw, solve or otherwise complete triangles which will serve as bridges, walkways and/or transport for the gerbils. After entering the map, gerbils will mindlessly move forward in a hopeless search for the safety of their burrow (level exit). Many dangers lie in wait such as crushers, water traps and spike pits. Only through solving triangle geometry challenges correctly can the player ensure that the gerbils have safe passage - failure will result in their deaths!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T11:02:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/840/840a16fe4dfc872b89eab9afd4f0a7a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Purple Muffin Productions"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
