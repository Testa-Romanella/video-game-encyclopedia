Rumored to not like people much, and hiding secrets Miss Harper must uncover, she's both strange and maybe even dangerous.</p>\n<p> Take control of Joanna's fate as you lead her down dangerous roads up in the mountains, where all you can rely on is your own judgement. Meet characters that might help you, or harm you, and figure out just who it is you can trust as they seduce you to love, danger, and everything in between.</p>\n<p> A fully voiced game to bring the characters to life, with branching paths, love, and grizzly endings that any horror fan will love.</p>\n\n<p>The game will be released completely for free, but I am hoping to raise money for the cost is to pay the staff of this game, both the artists and voice actors. If interested after downloading and giving it a play, please consider donating at Kickstarter to bring it fully to life.</p><p>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/setsunanoroi/manor-of-concealment?ref=user_...<br/></p>\n<p>Available on both PC and Mac.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:45:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb6ef3cec6f085e6a3e46f7c362a2f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SetsunaNoroi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
