Use this knockback to your advantage, though, and you'll be able to evade at ultra-high speeds (the \"shotgun dash\")!<br/>\r\nHoming missiles aren't as strong, but can be fired infinitely.<br/>\r\nThere's also super slow mode, but watch out: your score will decrease while it's activated!<br/>\r\nExpert players should challenge themselves to play without it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2be/2be45a2f5dda29399af07a57fb895ecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mankind"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mankind"], "esrb_rating": null}
