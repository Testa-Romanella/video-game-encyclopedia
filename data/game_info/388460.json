{"id": 388460, "slug": "sovereign-tea", "name": "Sovereign Tea (itch)", "name_original": "Sovereign Tea (itch)", "description": "<p><em><strong>This game is in early development!<br/>Please read the entire page before purchase!</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, and on Discord for development updates!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sovereign Tea</strong> is a Turn-Based Strategy RPG for desktop platforms with a simple premise: Tea VS Coffee. Play as the <em>Tea Princesses</em> and brew loyal <em>Tea Minions</em> to combat the wicked forces of the ever-growing <em>Coffee Empire</em>!<br/></p>\n<p>This game is still early in development. If you have feedback or suggestions, please reach out to us to share your thoughts. We at <strong>3 Halves Games</strong> always appreciate constructive criticism and feedback!<br/></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Coffee Empire</em> is growing by the minute, conquering lands that once belonged to the now-splintered <em>Tea Realm</em>. Despite their fundamental differences, the sovereigns of the land, the\u00a0<em>Tea Princesses</em>, agree to work together to stave off the impending threat and save their collective homeland.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sovereign Tea</strong> is a tile-based strategy game with emphasis on resource gathering and management. The <em>Tea Princesses</em> serve as your commanders in the fight against the <em>Coffee Empire</em>. By collecting resources on the map, you can brew a variety of <em>Tea Minions</em> that are contextually useful. Do you brew a fast but weak scout and use them to cultivate more resources on the map, or a slow but strong warrior to fend off the invading forces? With each map limited in its agricultural yields, it is up to you to experiment and adapt your overall strategy. Beware, however, as the <em>Coffee Empire</em> is capable of the exact same thing.</p>\n\n<p>As development progresses we will showcase more gameplay details about this unique brewing mechanic among others.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Each <em>Tea Realm</em> in the game is ruled over by a <em>Tea Princess</em>. The <em>Tea Princesses</em> are commander units with the ability to transform cultivated resources into <em>Tea Minions</em>. In their fight against the <em>Coffee Empire</em>, they have formed four unique alliances: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Herbal Teas</li><li>White Teas</li><li>Green Teas</li><li>Black Teas</li></ul>\n<p>Each alliance is composed of three different <em>Tea Princesses</em>. In game, these alliances have their own unique story arcs where they must overcome adversity in order to fend off attacks from different <em>Coffee Regents</em>. With four teams of three princesses, there are a total of twelve different playable <em>Tea Princesses</em>. <br/></p>\n<p>We look forward to sharing more information on each and every one of them in the coming months!<br/></p>\n\n<p>We're taking a different approach when it comes to pricing our game: we're scaling the price up as development progresses based on significant milestone. If you're an early adopter who happens to purchase this game before full release, you will gain early access and receive updates as they come. We want to be completely transparent with when we increase the price of our game and we hope the below graphic summarizes our intent well:<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you buy the game early, please take note that you are buying an <strong>in-development</strong> title. Do not expect a full game until the final milestone is met in Q4 2020. As always, should you purchase early please offer us any and all feedback! Your early support will help us craft <strong>Sovereign Tea</strong> into a truly great title.</p>\n<p>You can offer feedback by joining our Discord. If you purchased the game here, upon proof of purchase, we will award you with a unique <em>Savior of the Arts</em> role in our server!<br/></p>\n\n<p>As seen above in the Pricing Model section, we have different milestones we aim to reach in the development of this game.
