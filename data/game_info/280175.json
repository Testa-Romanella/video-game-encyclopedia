Your goal? Get yourself sacrificed as quickly as possible. Fight off 3 other players as you race to end your meager existence at the hands of the Minotaur.</p>\n<p>Each player is equipped with a spear. They can use it to kill the other players so that they can have the Minotaur all to themselves. These spears can also be embedded into the walls to strategically block off paths to other players. When the Minotaur catches you, he will wait a moment before delivering the killing blow. The other players can kill you during this delay, so make sure you're safe before confronting the Minotaur!</p>\n<p>This project was created for the Texas Aggie Game Developers Fall 2018 jam.
