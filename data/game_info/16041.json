All the primary art and much of the base tech has had its first and sometimes second and third pass. This includes bosses, levels, minions, player weapons, VFX and overall UI along many others. We\u2019re now focusing on the tweaks and tunes to weapons, scoring and feel of the game. What\u2019s in the game is workable but let\u2019s be honest \u2013 you want the best and so do we. We\u2019re taking the time to tune, playtest and make it awesome.<br/><br/>Our current estimates put the game landing early 2017. That is really dependent on how things come together from a gameplay and bug quashing perspective. We think it\u2019s very doable but we also believe there is no point in rushing a game out the door. Your support means something to us and we want to make it count. We\u2019ve been keeping a weekly blog going for a while now and we intend to keep it up.Steam Trading Cards, Steam Saves and AchievementsThese are all planned for release.
