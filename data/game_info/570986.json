These items will give you a significant advantage when attempting to complete the level. However, if you were to die, the picked-up items would be dropped in your last known location. So sometimes it might be best for you to simply save the best weapon till you are sure you can go ahead without dying because sometimes you will need to ;). This can be refreshed if you simply select <strong>Fresh Start</strong> on the death screen</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0FROZEN | Epic Majestic Orchestral Cover Collections By\u00a0Frostudio Chambersonic</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2be/2be002e66d2543c67144243d92113299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Azury"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
