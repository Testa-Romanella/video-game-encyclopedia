Compete against other players as you collect or steal treasure from fellow pirates. Survive against your foes\u00a0as your ship sinks down to the blimey deep. Quickly run across the board and outwit\u00a0your foes before you sink to the Ocean's abyss. Win by being the last of the pirates standing, and watch out for the artifacts on the ship, for their power can change the game with a flick of a doubloon.
