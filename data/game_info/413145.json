{"id": 413145, "slug": "cutout-tsarn", "name": "Cutout (TsarN)", "name_original": "Cutout (TsarN)", "description": "<p><strong>Cutout</strong> is a challenging Sokoban-like puzzle game but with a twist: you can cut <strong>holes</strong> in the level and then attach them back wherever you like.</p>\n<p>This game is created for Brackeys Game Jam 2020.1, theme is <strong>Holes</strong>. I really hope it's not such a stretch, but something like this is what my mind jumped to when I saw the theme.</p>\n<p>This game is created in Godot Engine and is <strong>currently incomplete!</strong> There are way too few levels, no sound or music whatsoever and (quite possibly) some bugs. If you notice some, please report. If you feel like some mechanic is poorly explained or isn't particularly obvious, please report it as well, I would be very grateful :) Also, there will be native builds, but a bit later. For now, just imagine the animation being 2-3 times smoother (and that's basically all the difference between browser version and native one).<br/></p>\n<p>Anyways, check back in a few days (after the jam ends) and maybe this game will be even better by then!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:13:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8af0cd5b29ddbb3168f7ed6811f349e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TsarN"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
