Along the way, Smurf can collect bonus items such as sarsaparilla leaves to increase his life count and raspberries to replenish his energy. Each section of the forest has its own set of dangers that Smurf must be careful to avoid. (In the Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive versions, you must also at the beginning of the game make your way through the Smurf Village!) Collecting stars in the Super Nintendo and Mega Drive versions will allow you to unlock bonus screens where Smurf can collect items to increase health and lives.</p>\n<p>In most levels of the 16-bit versions, Hefty will be the main playable character, while in some others, Brainy, Greedy, or Jokey may be that character.<br />\n(Smurfs Wiki)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-02T18:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/990146cd4d6f6e17d0bf2d6c91aed28f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES", "Game Boy", "SEGA Master System", "SEGA CD", "Genesis", "Game Gear", "NES"], "developers": ["Infogrames", "Bit Managers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
