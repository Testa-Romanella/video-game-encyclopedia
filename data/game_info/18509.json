It's fully 3D.<br/>\r\nYou are a young woman (perhaps correctly) accused of being a witch, by one of the local barons, and that is a death sentence.<br/>\r\nIn order to survive, you need to improve your standing, tool up, and indeed become a potent witch.<br/>\r\nThe gameplay is quite simple, but your hand is not held. Do not expect your objectives to glow in front of you, or indeed dangers to be obvious.<br/>\r\nPersevere, there is a way, a method, and a story, but it's not going to leap out and scream at you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\nIt's Pretty (in a grim way).<br/>\r\nNice landscape with day/night cycles (again, in a grim way).<br/>\r\nIt's only slightly silly: no copper bras, etc.<br/>\r\nMixture between oldskool (choice driven/find stuff) game play and 3D walk/run around.<br/>\r\nYou can jump (for no apparent reason).<br/>\r\nSave your game (although you'll have to find out how)<br/>\r\nShops (which you'll also have to find)<br/>\r\nEnemies (which you'll have no problems finding)<br/>\r\nApprox 2 Hrs game play (If you're a god, and a lucky one at that), much more if you're a mere mortal.<br/>\r\nSome really odd stuff that probably shouldn't be there (you'll find it). <br/>\r\nA RetroVision setting for the pixel purists, and Gamma adjust (for those who just can't see anything :)).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad3/ad311d24b448a87c8bc68a773be85983.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 110, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 34, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Imigea"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
