We use our Discord server to set up games and discuss balance. If you would like to start up a game, you can just click the \"Play the Game!\" button on the lobby main screen to see if the servers are currently populated, or simply join Discord and ask if anyone is up for a game. The answer is usually yes. To update to the latest version, all you need to do is join a server. The Lobby will download everything you need automatically. Steam already comes with the core game files and maps, but game updates are handled through the lobby. Updates happen early, often, and they are usually only a few kb in size.<strong>SPECIAL NOTE FOR LINUX USERS:</strong> The <strong>libsdl2-dev</strong> package is required.<strong>Evolution RTS</strong> is a free an Open Source RTS game designed using the Spring Engine.
