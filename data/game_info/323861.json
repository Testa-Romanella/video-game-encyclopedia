True fear is when you are constantly shamed, terrorized, and humiliated for years. True fear is when you can't see the end of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game builds up an unforgettable and unique atmosphere from the beginning. This is not a walking simulator, and this game does not contain jump-scares. You play as a mentally ill person who suffers from panic disorders.<br/><br/>You play as me...<br/><br/><br/><br/>I created this game because I wanted to show people how it feels to be a child who grew up in a family that's falling apart.<br/><br/>Back then, the only thing I had was a book. When I read it again and again, it would sometimes feel like I was inside it, in a different place.<br/>For me, that was an escape from reality.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Features:</h3><ul><li> An Immersive first person experience.<br/></li><li> A physics based world, where you can interact with every object.<br/></li><li> Puzzles that you can solve in different ways.<br/></li><li> A completely narrated main story, by the professional voice actor Isaak Wells.<br/></li><li> 3D sound implementation for the best experience.<br/></li><li> Original music made by me.<br/></li><li> A true, original story that will change the way you see child abuse.</li></ul><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-28T13:46:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a9643b4f21ecaedfb6609279d1ad578d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam - Lost Memories", "Adam Dubi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["AdamDubiGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
