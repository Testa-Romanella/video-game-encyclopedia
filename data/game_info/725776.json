Will young Yamada leave the hospital with his sanity intact?<h3>CHARACTER</h3><br/>\"Begrudging Nurse\" Tachibana<br/>Voice: Mirau<br/><br/>Serious, responsible, and excellent at her job. However, after being stuck between difficult management and inexperienced juniors for so long, her expression is as austere as her gaze is icy\u2014even to her patients and colleagues. Tachibana's compassion and love for nursing have all but faded, and she attends to Yamada in a brisk, soulless manner, driven only by her stubborn sense of duty.<br/><br/><br/>\"Insidious Nurse\" Kurokawa<br/>Voice: Hikaru Isshiki<br/><br/>Sneaky and self-deprecating, Kurokawa is quick to bow and scrape when caught out, but is equally adept at bad-mouthing others the second they're not in the room. A self-proclaimed \"trash human\" with a penchant for petty revenge on all rivals, real or imagined. Avoids confronting people she sees as more powerful, but revels in bullying the weak. This nurse also loves to play the victim card\u2014and believes all her own nonsense, too. Suspects Yamada to be fellow trash and thus a potential ally.<br/><br/><br/>\"Violent Nurse\" Yamaguchi<br/>Voice: Misaki Kamishiro<br/><br/>Former teen delinquent with a mean violent streak and obvious anger management issues\u2014Yamaguchi is keen to let her fists do the talking for her. Perhaps due to her rough past, she doesn't take well to perceived slights and has a problem with following orders. Underneath, she's a hopeless romantic, although this softer side is never directed at Yamada.<br/><br/><br/>\"Demotivational Nurse\" Hiramatsu<br/>Voice: Elena Kaibara<br/><br/>Chronically lazy and unmotivated. Slacks off every chance she gets unless constantly supervised. Hiramatsu is thoroughly apathetic and indifferent, not least when tending to Yamada's needs. She gives off a languid anti-work aura wherever she goes, and takes her sweet time getting anything done. Sports a consistently sloppy and unkempt appearance. About the only time this nurse perks up is when she's been drinking.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-19T06:52:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34c/34cd7b4367e3dd2c012db07184c2978c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark One!"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Shiravune"], "esrb_rating": null}
