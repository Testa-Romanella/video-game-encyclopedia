Just select DEFENDER from the cassette menu, and then type RUN in the main screen and hit <enter>. Type LIST to see the instructions listed at the\u00a0end of the program.\r\n</enter></p>\n<p>The game is inspired by a game from the Sinclair Spectrum.</p>\n<p>Source\u00a0Code:\u00a0https://github.com/jggames/trs80mc10/tree/master/quicktype/Arcade/JumpJack</p>\n<p>Blog Posting:\u00a0https://jimgerrie.blogspot.com/2021/06/jumping-jack-yet-another-10liner-and.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T06:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/909/909e42378d78fd7db8e9cf70552b459e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jgerrie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
