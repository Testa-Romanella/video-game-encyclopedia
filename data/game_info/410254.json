Three menus are presently completed, and each explore both an imagined game and\u00a0a different aspect of main menus:<br/></p>\n<ol><li><strong>JITTERBUG</strong>\u00a0explores the 'how to play' mini-tutorial, and an impossible interface and a technicolor bug</li><li><strong>8 Tons of Oxygen</strong>\u00a0looks at the level select screen. It asks whether or not it is possible to experience the entire story of a game simply through a level selection screen and the novel mechanic of being able to differently subdivide the narrative</li><li><strong>Empires of Idleness</strong>\u00a0considers the ability to generate a starting world (a la Civilization). It reimagines the 4X genre in non productive terms: rather than being asked to eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate, players are tasked with becoming as idLe as possible</li></ol>\n<p>Playing <em>MNG+</em>:</p>\n<p>There is no menu for <em>MNG+</em>. This is not a joke. In order to explore the above imaginary games through\u00a0<em>their</em>\u00a0menus, you must simply click the 'new game' button. <em>MNG+</em> will take you quite literally and give you a whole new game.</p>\n<p>To quit: press 'quit game' from a given menu, or press 'esc' at any time.</p>\n<p><em>Note that browser version might be slow depending on your internet connection!
