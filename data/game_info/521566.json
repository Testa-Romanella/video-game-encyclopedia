Instead of the impostor you play a mighty Vampire who can transform and cast powerful spells.</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/x63K24xDeH</p>\n\r\nSo what is this?\r\n<p>A small village in place very far away is haunted by the creatures of the night!<br/>The inhabitants try to defend their small village in order to survive.</p>\n<p>Villagers survive by doing tasks to produce equipment. Like weapons and armor to defend themselves, or food to heal faster.</p>\n\n<p>The vampires hide among the villagers. Noone but the vampires know who they are. For the vampires to win they\u00a0will try to assassinate the villagers until none are left.</p>\n<p>For the villagers to win they need to kill all vampires. But unfortunately the\u00a0vampires become stronger with time, and the less villagers are left the harder it will be to defend the village.</p>\n<p>AmongUndead allows many different play styles. As a villager\u00a0you can complete the tasks as fast as possible and hope the vampire is not after you. Or you can travel in groups to the remote locations on the map to get an advantage when you get attacked.</p>\n<p>You have the choice!</p>\n\r\nThe deal:\r\n<p>The game is currently listed as free and not released. We will sell it later:</p>\n<p>Pay $2.99 to get the full game on release, or exclusive content for the free version!<br/>The project is currently early access. So the price is reasonably low out of gratitude for our early supporters! We hope to release the game on steam in the future pending development.</p>\n<p>The full version gives you access to following features:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>2x probability to play as a\u00a0vampire!</li><li>ability to invite friends and private games *</li><li>exclusive discord roles *</li><li>access to other privileged game features *</li></ul>\n<p> (* features planned but not added to the game yet)</p>\n\r\nWhat we have planned:\r\n<ul><li>There will be more\u00a0content. Like more tasks, more equipment and items. We could add a workshop where you make tools for tasks. Or allow you to create armor at the forge and perhaps even enhance it. Also the vampire could get a castle which allows for upgrades and spells</li><li>The current visuals of the game are early ones. There are huge improvements planned for the character art and a lot of the environment done by professional artist!</li><li>We took great care to make the gameplay smooth and create an amazing experience. We plan to improve that even further with feedback from the community!\u00a0https://discord.gg/x63K24xDeH</li><li>There is a lot room for the game\u00a0to grow by polishing the audio. We plan to create an\u00a0immersion that reflects the player's imagination!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T07:20:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb5c61d6f619039a64762051b83173d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AmongUndead"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
