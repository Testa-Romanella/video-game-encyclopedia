The story is seen from the point of view of Jenkins \u2013 an employee of the company, in charge of deciding when and how much of the tree\u2019s roots to mine. Jenkins mainly communicates with Dagon Halston \u2013 the head of the finance department; Quinn Williams \u2013 the company\u2019s certified arborist and geologist. Arborist: also known as \u201ctree surgeon\u201d, expert on trees. Quinn mostly advises Jenkins to slow down with mining, as she is concerned about safety. Dagon mostly advises Jenkins to mine more, as he is concerned with the company\u2019s bottom line. Jenkins has to decide what sectors around the tree to mine. Each decision affects 2 scores: profit and damage. These 2 numbers at the end of the game determine the outcome of the story. If the profit is less that a certain amount, Jenkins gets fired, as he failed to generate enough profit for the company. If the damage is higher than a certain amount, the tree collapses, falling on the city and causing devastation, as well as destroying the company headquarters. If the profit is enough and the damage not too much, Jenkins keeps his job and the tree doesn\u2019t fall.</p>\n<p>Swipe screen to play<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T19:49:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d31/d31348f031d6df8f2fd0afa6a43a4f68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mapto"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
