Gather raw materials; upgrade your tools, camp, and defenses; and brave the unknown with increasingly difficult match-3 gameplay.<br/></p>\n<p>Players with Web Monetization enabled can toggle an optional resource bonus, and get early access to an alternative tileset that normally unlocks near the end of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme: RAW</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The RAW theme immediately pushed my brain to \"raw materials\" and I bounced between a few ideas of factory games, and farming games. Finally I landed on a pseudo-incremental game idea where you would play a match-3 puzzle game to collect the resources you need.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Credits</strong><br/></p><p>All programming and game design done by me, David Brad.<br/>Art assets created by myself &amp; Kenney (https://kenney.nl)<br/>Music by Andrey Sitkov<br/>Sound Effects made with the ZzFX<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made using no external engines, frameworks, or major libraries.<br/>Two single-file libraries were used and modified within my engine code:</p><p>ZzFX by Frank Force used for the sound effects. \r\n<br/>https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX<br/>https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX <br/></p><p>tiny-canvas used for 2D WebGL rendering. \r\n<br/>https://github.com/bitnenfer/tiny-canvas<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T14:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/305bac812a882cb0e5933560dfd8efdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fanlix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
