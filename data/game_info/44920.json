Difficulty increases exponencially due to friendly collision avoidance and prediction of the player's movement.<br/>\r\n - Lander: Just land on the green platform avoiding hard impacts. Each propulsor is activated with one key (hard to control).<br/>\r\n - Canon: Shoot to all the objects within the given time.<br/>\r\n - Helicopter: Reach the end of the tube avoiding sensible hits.<br/>\r\n - Prevent the red button from going down: And don't get destroyed and destroy the enemy balls.<br/>\r\n - Memory: Memorize the path and repeat it.<br/>\r\n - Coloured balls: Match the other ball's color upon collision.<br/>\r\n - Jump through the hole: That's it.<br/>\r\n - Jump up: From one orb to another without touching the biohazard yellow material and reach de ceilling.<br/>\r\n - Shooter: Destroy all the moving objects but don't get too close.<br/>\r\nYou can watch the trailer and see some of them. In the future, I may include some more minigames if the community supports me.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/16780047e4c7f685078834a173a6db3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Babalus123"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Babalus123"], "esrb_rating": null}
