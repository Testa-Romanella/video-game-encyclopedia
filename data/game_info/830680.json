Collapsing spatial and temporal scales, RIFT invites users to contemplate the limits and merits of the scientific gaze. The architecture of this world is derived entirely from 3D scans captured at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico. Additional texture images come from the PhenoCam Network and the trailcam database at Sevilleta NWR. This work was produced as part of the 2022 Sevilleta Art &amp; Ecology REU program.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T10:55:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a2/0a281d9365068a16c824c0a9db11c3dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mc_vigilante"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
