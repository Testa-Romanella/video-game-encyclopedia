Each game is short, lasting just a few minutes, ideal for short play sessions or the hunt for the top score.<br/><br/>When you start, two game modes are immediately available:<br/><ul><li> <strong>Classic</strong> mode, in which you must place all the tiles in your deck to finish the game.<br/></li><li> <strong>Challenge</strong> mode, in which you unlock new tiles as you score points. In this mode, you can place the tiles wherever you like.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T08:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e16/e167c06c9f9ac320138a064e0177af76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christophe Coyard"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Christophe Coyard"], "esrb_rating": null}
