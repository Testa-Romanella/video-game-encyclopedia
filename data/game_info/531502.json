There are three drinks to serve: coffee, beer and wine. You can carry up to five drinks at any time and have to serve them to the customers quickly in order to make them happy.</p>\n<br/><em>Interact with the beer tap, coffee machine and wine rack to gather drinks.</em><br/>\n<p>Undesired events need to be resolved quickly as well. Most noticeable is the jukebox that breaks down once in a while, generating negative smileys until fixed. More events will unlock over time, like customers vomiting or getting upset while playing the arcade machine.</p>\n<p><em>Serve drinks and resolve undesired events to earn positive smileys and prevent negative ones.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Each type of customer behaves differently. Like the blue shirt customer who only drinks beer, is very impatient and prone to vomit on the floor. Learning each and everyone's favorite drinks and behavior is key to become a super barkeeper!</p>\n<br/><em>The green shirt customer is easy going. In contrast the blue shirt customer is very impatient.</em><br/>\r\nA\u00a0tribute\u00a0to Flash games\r\n<p>This is a tribute to the very first game jam I've ever joined. Back in 2004, during the heydays of Flash games, I submitted this little game for the Flashkit 48 Hours Competition. Last week, just before Flash support was discontinued, I rediscovered it still lingering on Newgrounds.</p>\n<p><em>Bar Keeper from 2004, made in Macromedia Flash 8 (I think).</em><br/></p>\r\nAdditional credits\r\n<p><strong>Colour palette</strong><br/>https://lospec.com/palette-list/endesga-32</p>\n<p><strong>Audio effects<br/></strong>http://freesoundeffect.net/<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/>Surf Shimmy by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4448-surf-shimmy<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T06:22:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b95/b9553a6af5837074a9a0e5a940242a26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bauke Regnerus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
