Even trained individuals have admitted to forgetting steps under pressure. On the other hand, people without any experience are left clueless in this situation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jind is able to provide a comprehensive breakdown of certain medical procedures one can perform as a part of First-Aid. Jind is able to provide this guidance at any time it is required. Her humanistic touch allows for a more realistic and inclusive experience. Jind is powered by IBM Watson Natural Language Processing application programming interfaces. She can conversate with you in a bi-directional dialog conversation format.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not only can the application provide realistic conversational guidance, but it also features a simplified manual walk through of steps, build right into the application.<br/></p>\n<p>The dialog of Jind is based on the NZ Red Cross Essential First-Aid Manual. Her attire is inspired by the ST John First-Aid respondents' uniform. Her name translates to \"Life\" in Punjabi.</p>\n<p>Jind is currently a prototype and is constraint to just providing CPR guidance. However in future developments the aim will be to have Jind cover as many sections in the First-Aid guide as possible.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Rawinder Singh\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://github.com/lilwindax\u00a0</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements:</p>\n<p>Devon Gibson (3D Modeling),\u00a0Scott Hwang (Proj F)</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------- Disclaimer -------------------------------------------\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Content has been made available for informational and educational purposes only.
