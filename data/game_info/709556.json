This game was made by Yadislash, who is new to game-making. this game is very simple, you have to shoot the evil cubes until you are tired of doing it. Please don't expect\u00a0<em>big\u00a0</em>things like health, stamina, aiming, etc. this game was made by only one 9-year-old, so I think I did a pretty on this game for a tween. The controls are simple: LMB for shooting, WASD or arrow keys for moving, Space Bar for jumping, and P key/ 1 for pausing. I'm also working on another project which I am guaranteed to do better on. I hope you enjoy this game!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:24:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9a/b9a61f9d3ae56688c3959412b783521a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yadislash"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
