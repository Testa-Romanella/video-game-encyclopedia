{"id": 117717, "slug": "autoartevolve", "name": "AutoArtEvolve", "name_original": "AutoArtEvolve", "description": "<p>A program which generates art, and changes its settings depending on which art you like. It uses AutoArt to generate art and this name generator to name them. The program works by creating random functions (e.g. 2*x+sin y) to make the color of each pixel depend on its coordinates. The program then changes the chances of certain operations (e.g. *, +, sin) appearing in functions depending on which art you like.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning: May not work on Mac</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Installation instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>On Windows, just extract the .zip file, and run AutoArtEvolve.exe. On Mac or GNU/Linux, you'll have to download the source code. The source code requires Python, Numpy, and PIL/Pillow.
