And that in each levels, there are 3 \"scenarios\", each with a slightly more complex message to send than the last.</p>\n<p>And when you move to the next level, the percentage of mistakes you're allowed goes down as well.</p>\n<p>But right now, all you can do is have the operator print messages.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:48:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00eeac6cbb1b4b59138f4d59508d0588.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["IosDawn"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
