However, as a team we only ever did the writing for the fangame and nothing else. I decided that rather than letting that writing go to waste, I would use it in a smaller-scale type of project.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>World End Syndrome: Another Summer\u00a0</em>is a non-canon addition to the\u00a0<em>World End Syndrome\u00a0</em>world. <em>WES: AS\u00a0</em>is filled with different scenarios featuring each character. <em>WES: AS</em>\u00a0<em>(Hanako)\u00a0</em>only features scenarios involving Hanako Yamada (which only involves 1 since only 1 scenario was written up at the time).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In the future, I plan to release the other scenarios, so think of <em>WES: AS (Hanako)</em>\u00a0as episode 1 in a series of 5. Also, these scenarios are <strong>not </strong>that long, so think of them as visual novellas rather than full-length novels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Discord Server link for those who are interested in joining the <em>World End Syndrome</em> community:\u00a0https://discord.gg/2Xwt7m2ect). </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:43:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c21554c2e6e6310ff29685307c8d9f90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rosie Nekonin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
