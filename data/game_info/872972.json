Collect blood and avoid the vampire hunter!

It focuses both on the theme Vampires and the limitation \"Blood is lethal.\" While I have been doing game development for a while, this is the first game I have published on Itch.io and the first game jam I have participated in! All the code and art is made by me and has been produced in the last 2 days. Sadly, I have not added sound or music, but who knows, maybe I will in the future! Thank you for playing and have a spooky halloween &lt;3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T04:36:55", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jamie of rivia"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
