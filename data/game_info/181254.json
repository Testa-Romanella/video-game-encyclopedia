It is a simpler game than my previous entries, but this was the biggest challenge yet. Why?</p>\n<p>Time\u2026 time\u2026 It was my wife\u2019s birthday this weekend and I spent most of the weekend playing with the kids, getting birthday gifts, celebrating the birthday, riding motocross, and spending time with my family. When 10 hours remained of Ludum Dare 38 I had put about 5 hours into making the game. I finished the game a couple of minutes before the deadline. Total time spent on game, approx 15 hours. Detailed video and Post Portem will follow =)</p>\n<p>Still, I hope that you enjoy the game! Available in WebGL and Windows download.</p>\r\nVIDEO OF GAME-PLAY\r\n\r\nVIDEO OF MAKING-OF TIME LAPSE", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d7/4d71305cb0d40d858a85dac93b684074.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["imphenzia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
