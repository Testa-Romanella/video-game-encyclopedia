Help Chuchel to chase down the mysterious villain and retrieve his cherished cherry! Outsmart the Pool Monster, escape frenzied Pac-Men and master the bird race. Join forces with Chuchel&#39;s buddy Kekel and show the mischievous Chrchel that stealing cherries is wrong.</p>\n<p>The reward? A hearty situational humor, wild music and sounds by the band DVA and hundreds of hilarious animations that warm up even the coldest of souls. Plus cherries.</p>\n<p>The game is all about the main character Chuchel and his never-ending passion for cherries. He is a cute hairy creature (an angry hair-ball basically) who is as pleasant as screaming kids and as intelligent as a potato. His silly orange hat is just  the cherry on top. Don&#39;t get fooled by his silly looks though - Chuchel is a true hero who never gives up.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2018-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-13T04:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a8f/a8fd414f2e209b25b7081a23d04ba3ab.jpg", "website": "https://amanita-design.net/games/chuchel.html", "rating": 3.88, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 46, "owned": 502, "beaten": 152, "toplay": 48, "dropped": 17, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 175, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 181, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "macOS"], "developers": ["Amanita Design"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Family", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Amanita Design"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
