We are 3 students from Europe, Hungary. The game is about Billy Boy\u00a0who can't escape from the prison of colors. Your job is\u00a0to help him in the process of escape. You have to press the the numbers from 1-7 to change the color of Billy Boy, because you can only jump on platforms that are the same color as you.\u00a0 There're also special things\u00a0that you can use to stop the border(what kills you if you are not fast enough) for 5 secs or to make Billy Boy a rainbow(that's good because you can jump to any kind of platforms, but be careful, watch the time) for 5 secs. The music in the menu is pretty cool, but in the game...(be careful for your nervous system)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:10:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/528/528c74f55cd9658ee675d93e463be177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["The Seven"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
