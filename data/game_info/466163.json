{"id": 466163, "slug": "understaffed-tank-crew", "name": "Understaffed Tank Crew", "name_original": "Understaffed Tank Crew", "description": "<p>You are the commander of the last surviving tank on the battlefield. Two of your four-person crew have been incapacitated, so you'll only have control of two of the four functions of the tank at any one time. Please note, commander: Although most tanks' gunners aim and shoot,\u00a0\u00a0we had to separate those functions in this tank, in order to get the best armor or bullets or something. Good luck, and don't let the literally infinite enemies dampen your spirits. We're all counting on you.<br/></p>\n<p>Here are your tank's functions and their controls. Note:\u00a0You MUST have a crew in that slot to enable the control.</p>\n\n<p>Swap Crew Menu:<br/>Hold Space /\u00a0Shift:\u00a0Open crew menu. Then, drag-and-drop the faces of the crews to swap seats.\u00a0The game will slow down while it is open, so don't worry about swapping quickly.</p>\n<p>Driver:<br/>WASD / Arrow Keys:\u00a0Turn left/right, drive forward and backward<br/></p>\n<p>Aimer:<br/>Mouse:\u00a0Aim turret<br/>Right-Click:\u00a0Lock turret position</p>\n<p>Gunner:<br/>Left-Click: shoot<br/></p>\n<p>Loader:<br/>R: Reload Autoloader Magazine<br/>(also happens automatically when you run out of ammo)</p>\n<p>TIPS:</p><ul><li>It is way easier to kill enemies with an aimer!\u00a0Hold W to go forward, then switch to aimer and gunner for better control, the tank will continue to drive.</li><li>You can switch both crew members at the same time. The cooldown only happens when you exit the menu.</li><li>There's no win screen or anything, so don't worry about dying.</li></ul>\n<p>Project Info:<br/></p>\n<p>Submitted for the GMTK Game Jam 2020.
