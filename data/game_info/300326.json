Click on the fish to catch them and gain points. (There is currently no way to lose lol, enjoy)</p><p>This is my first ever game made on Unity! I\u00a0simply just looked up tutorials whenever I\u00a0wanted to add a feature, I know it's pretty bad and you can't even lose but I still had a fun time making it and I want to make more in the future. The volume slider doesn't actually work because there is no sound and the graphics are pretty bad, I\u00a0don't know if I\u00a0will work on this in the future. Probably not because I\u00a0was just making it for practice and to learn and I already have ideas for\u00a0other projects. Let me know what you think, if they're any bugs, and what I could improve on, thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a0646f4197d25b03d38c9905318211c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Noah"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
