Try to beat the par times on each level (some levels are locked)<br/><br/></p><p><strong>Playing tips:</strong></p><p>The mechanics have quite a steep learning curve and since we didn't have time to make levels to make the player feel a smooth transition it turned out out very user unfriendly :P<br/></p><ol><li>Jump and stick to a wall by holding the movement key against it (A or D) and while still pressing tap W to do a clean wall jump. Also If you're falling it'll be harder to stick.</li><li>Try not to gain too much velocity while on air, the cream is not very heavy and will easily lose control.</li><li>Fire at enemies from behind to push them with more force, giving you a better chance to throw them off a platform.</li><li>Don't try to rush on a level until you're very used to the player mechanics.</li><li>In general when moving try to tap the keys to gradually have control instead of pressing them down. If you manage to have control over the player mechanics it'll get a lot easier and entertaining (at least it was for us).</li><li>Take it easy :D</li></ol><p><strong>Attributions:</strong></p><p>My partner Marccio Silva for helping me with all the art, making more levels, implementing the hud, and a lot more, couldn't have made it in time without him.</p><p>Music from opengameart.org:</p><p>http://opengameart.org/content/what-a-nice-surpris...</p><p>http://opengameart.org/content/8bit-adventure</p><p>http://opengameart.org/content/the-sleeping-funk-l...</p><p>Backgrounds:<br/></p><p>http://opengameart.org/content/space-desert-background</p><p>http://opengameart.org/content/starfield-background</p><p>http://opengameart.org/content/space-backdrop</p><p>The game is open source and on github:<br/>https://github.com/RoboNutria/ice-cream-overlord<br/><br/>We will continue to improve this game in the future to implement all the ideas we have and make it live up to it's name.<br/>Thank you for any feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2da/2dae6c2b1d71abc0e7dd90cee50cd3a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lordcoppetti", "marcciosilva"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
