These <strong>RULES</strong> will reassign the game's blocks so that they have different effects. As these RULES\u00a0stack up, the game will get harder and more complex. See how high of a level you can reach before succumbing to an existential crisis!</p>\n<p>Everything here was made by me: code, art, (most of the) sound, and the music :)</p>\n<p><em>Update 11/2 - Added a menu, tutorial, music, sound, and a better difficulty curve</em></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>W, D - Move<br/>S - Crouch<br/>Space - Jump, Double Jump<br/>Escape - Return to menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/356/3564a0f9b8c66ea3d32d143787139956.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dwight Davis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
