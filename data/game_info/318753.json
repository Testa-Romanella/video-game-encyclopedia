Having time constrains is always a perfect way to push your boundaries and learn a lot. If you have not have tried it yet, I deeply recommend to attempt to develop a game in a week!\u00a0</p>\r\nGame Overview\r\n<p>Eternal Bond is a 3D top down action game where you play a Skeleton who swore to protect his/her beloved for eternity.\u00a0\u00a0Uphold your promise and fight greedy treasure-hunters who continuously sneak in the\u00a0crypts where she rests undermining her peace. But be careful: the intruders cannot touch the tomb or your bond will be weakened!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard and Mouse: </strong><br/>- Mouse on menus<br/>- WASD or Arrows to move<br/>- Space to Attack<br/><br/><strong>Gamepad:<br/></strong>- Left Analog stick to move<br/>- Button A (or X with PlayStation controllers)\u00a0 on menus<br/>- Button\u00a0 X (or Square with PlayStation controllers) to attack<br/><br/>Feel free to leave me a feedback, report bugs and share your thoughts.
