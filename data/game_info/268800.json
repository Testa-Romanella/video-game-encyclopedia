Just like in real life, drifting is challenging and requires some technique and speed.  You'll need to get some speed, swing wide entering a corner and then immediately counter-steer the opposite direction.  The physics have been tuned for precise control in a tight city environment.  Because this is also a parking game, smashing into things means you failed to park.  It's challenging, but once you get the hang of it, we think you'll find it to be a rewarding experience.<br/><br/>Compatiblity Information: Due to high quality 3D graphics and level size, this game requires 1024 mb of ram and may not run on older devices.
