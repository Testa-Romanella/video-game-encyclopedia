Obviously that would make Tetris pretty easy, so I decided to take control of the block away from the player. With the block moving from side to side (each with it's unique but consistent pattern), the player now has<em> only one</em> job; to press<em> only one</em> button at just the right time to determine where the block falls.<br/></p>\n<p>Don't forget to press the INFO button in-game for a little more INFO about the game.</p>\n<p>I hope everyone enjoys playing my game almost as much as I enjoyed making it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:51:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19f/19f70e49adf4a197a3a7ac2be5dc3c33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["jmthomas6"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
