I was inspired by my own experience of struggling to accept myself and running from the truth within me.\u00a0 There are painful experiences I have had that have left me feeling broken and lost, running from my shadows. There are times when I have felt totally consumed by my shadows instead of being the complete human being that I would like to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the game sEVEN this is represented by a boy who has lost pieces of his soul and is running from his shadow as he recovers them. If his shadow catches up to him before he has recovered all the pieces of his soul, then he becomes consumed by it and has to start over. Once the boy has collected all seven pieces of his soul he becomes complete and able to accept his shadow. I chose the number\u00a0seven because it represents completion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T10:32:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2de/2de9f90005fe9c5553ebd7f1481616c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SolomonFalls"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
