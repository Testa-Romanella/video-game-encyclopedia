Your name is Aodhan Sloani, a rookie blonde freelance warrior in Medieval Scotland. You and 40 other soldiers are tasked to loot a cavern, but little did you know, it was a boobytrap. You and your platoon are ambushed, and you and Teige, your commander is the only one left, but suddenly, the ground below you explodes and you are sent to another realm. You manage to survive the fall unscathed, but Teige is rendered temporarily disabled. It's up to you  to defeat the evil Bruikwich lurking around the corner, gather health potions, and defeat An Gan Ainm, the Nameless and free you and Teige.\r\n</p>\n<p>To move, you press arrow keys. When you spawn in, always go to the cloaked NPC with a bow, that's Teige. He will give you quests and reward you with health potions once completed. Kill the Bruikwich and find the ruby or the gold coin to progress onto the next level, but be careful, there is always some sort of Mega-Bruikwich on the next level, so conserve your potions wisely.  To attack press: z, y, x, or v.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:51:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afa3c7274abff30e40e5fda295ebec5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Demonwater Arts"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
