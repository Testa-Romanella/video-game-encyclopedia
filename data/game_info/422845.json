{"id": 422845, "slug": "word-runner-dillywapper", "name": "Word Runner (Dillywapper)", "name_original": "Word Runner (Dillywapper)", "description": "<p>This is an early version of our game created for the Drexel CS/GMAP-345 game programming and design class as a final project. The goal of the game is to find the correct word as a solution to the obstacles that spawn in front of you as you move along. What may work for some obstacles won\u2019t work for others. To help find the solution, words will fly about; some are solutions and others are dummy words that won\u2019t act as a solution.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Currently the game has five obstacles with three solutions each. There is no guarantee that the same obstacle won\u2019t appear twice, thrice, or even more times in a row. You have three lives and one is lost if you fail to enter a solution in time. The dummy words are also of a small list. Originally they were from a text document of considerable length but this had issues when compiling into a Unity build.</p>\n<p>Known major Bugs/issues:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Reset is weird concerning missing an obstacle and having the main mechanic of the game reset; sometimes you see a quick flash/clip of the background but it's otherwise corrected.</p>\n<p>You have to click into the input field to start typing a solution and must click out/press enter. Pressing enter again rehighlights for the next obstacle so you can be ready.</p>\n<p>There is no menu, pause, or way to exit the game (Alt + F4 or Alt + Tab!)\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T06:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed35a5c2349dcfdbed411a2cd6102d97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dillywapper"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
