Swapping a block over an edge will cause it to fall.\r\n</p>\n<p>The stack rises over time. The game ends when blocks reach the top of the stack. The rising of the stack is delayed while matched blocks are clearing.\r\n</p>\n<p>Combos are triggered by clearing more than three blocks at once. Chains are triggered by matches caused by blocks falling due to cleared blocks below.\r\n</p>\n<p>Combos and Chains dramatically increase scoring and pause the rise of the board.\r\n</p>\n<p>Garbage blocks fall on the top of the stack. They can only be cleared by touching matches of other blocks. Garbage clears to standard blocks. Because these blocks stay suspended in air while converting, they provide an opportunity for counter attack by lining up matching blocks beneath to set up chains.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made by @stevelavietes and @stephan_gfx</p>\n<p>Music by @stevelavietes\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking a look, we hope you enjoy!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T12:03:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db1/db1a5f1d1e62d005a9d8395df57f16ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lonely Star Software", "stephan_gfx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
