This is our first game jam and pretty much our first game. We hope you all enjoy what we have come up with.</p>\n<p>[ABOUT THE GAME]</p>\n<p>In DrunkRun you drank a bit too much and now you need to run to the bathroom as fast as possible! Drink the beer to remove 5 seconds from the timer, but be aware: drinking will remap your keyboard controls. You will also be given a medal at the end of each level based on your time.\u00a0Please, feel free to send us feedback or bug reports.
