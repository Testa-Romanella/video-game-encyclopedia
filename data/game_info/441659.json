All that guides you are two instructions that seem burned into your core. Get Rings. Destroy Cubes.</p>\n<p>You look around and see many brilliantly lit rings in your path. You try flying through one and instantly your ship is enhanced. After awhile, you notice a cube flying towards you through the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before you can react, the cube slams into your ship and you take noticeable damage. Just before the second blow, you let off a few crystals and blast the attacker to pieces. You feel a warm satisfaction seeing the remains of the cube fly through space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After looking around some more, you notice a massive cube pulsating in what looks to be the center of the world. Just looking at it, you are filled with the urge to blast it away. You don't know how you got the instructions you did, but now they are your destiny.<br/></p>\n<p>GET RINGS</p>\n<p>DESTROY CUBES</p><p>Follow me at:\u00a0https://twitter.com/buffaloHD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T09:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c55dba0489e84b07d6efcfeacb0d35ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["buffaloHD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
