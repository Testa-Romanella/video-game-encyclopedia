{"id": 476697, "slug": "ossuary-itch-damian-gareth-walker", "name": "Ossuary (itch) (Damian Gareth Walker)", "name_original": "Ossuary (itch) (Damian Gareth Walker)", "description": "<p>Oh no, not again. Another necromancer has set up home in the village Ossuary, the impressive underground cemetery in which the villagers have interred their dead for centuries. Not only has he animated the bodies of the dead to serve as his friends, but he has also enchanted and enlarged the once natural creatures who had made their home under the vaults, and has them wandering around as guard animals and pets. All this does nothing for the dignity of funerals and other ceremonies the villagers are still trying to hold down there.<br/></p>\n<p>So they've asked you, a young travelling hero trying to make your fortune, to help rid them of this nuisance. What you lack in experience you make up for in enthusiasm and willingness to put your life at risk for... well, for gold, basically. And as your reward the villagers will give you any treasure that you can carry out of the Ossuary with you. And being an adventuring hero, you can carry a lot.</p>\n<p>Every game of Ossuary will be different. The 24 levels of the Ossuary are laid out at random. While each successive level will be harder, the appearance of different kinds of creatures, and the weapons and other items you will need to deal with them, may be earlier or later from game to game. Your hero will be different too: sometimes he'll be more proficient with a sword, while in other games, better at magic. So you'll be able to play this again and again.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Released for the ZX Spectrum: 18th March 2013<br/>Release for DOS TBA</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:39:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd9/fd9428205e06b8b731b0f1f6adefa5ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Damian Gareth Walker"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
