Maybe he will boost your party attack speed or the magic power of your\u00a0mages. But maybe he will bring a curse to your team, slowing them down, reducing their HP, their defenses or poison them over time.</p>\n<p>As you progress, you will encounter\u00a0towns, dungeons and castles. Again, the unintended mechanic is at play here. For example:\u00a0</p>\n<p>If your party is composed of Orcs and you visit an elven village, the villagers won't be happy and will attack you if you try to enter.\u00a0On the other hand, if your party is mostly composed of friendly factions , they will let you enter and help you (heal at inns, exchange party member\u00a0at the tavern)</p>\n<p>The game is not completed.\u00a0To attack a target, you select an enemy, then click on any unit in your party that is ready to attack.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Please use the Windows version since the html is likely to cause\u00a0a UI problem</em></p>\n<p>Tool used:</p><p>Game engine: Unity</p><p>Music : FL Studio (free edition)</p><p>SFX:\u00a0https://www.bfxr.net/<br/></p><p>Textures : Paint.net\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I created all the assets except the font that was created by\u00a0Kenney\u00a0www.kenney.nl and free/open source.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T03:21:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26f/26f365c628fde3218a650e923a669a34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LavwaDuke"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
