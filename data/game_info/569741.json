In the very middle hides their den - a dark and mossy hollow, hiding sharp teeth, biting claws, and whatever shiny trinkets the beavers have discovered in their travels. There is no easy season to approach the den, but then, the journey is the best part of any adventure.</p>\n<p>The Dam at River's Bend.\u00a0s an independent production by Jeff Glass and is not affiliated with Losing Games.
