It works perfectly fine in my the editor while I was creating my project and the packaging had no issues as well.\u00a0If anyone knows a solution, it would be highly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T06:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd6/cd60e6520185f20e4011f762a1b7ca54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BR-Inky"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
