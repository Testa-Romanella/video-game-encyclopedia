{"id": 572598, "slug": "noita-quickdraw-script", "name": "Noita Quickdraw Script", "name_original": "Noita Quickdraw Script", "description": "<p>When playing NOITA, I always end up just using one single wand, because of the bother of changing back and forth. I think the game could give a richer experience if you could fire any of the four wands at will, like in RISK OF RAIN.<br/></p>\n<p>This script will let you fire the four wands instantly. It also lets you pour liquid instantly, from the lastly selected flask.</p>\n<p>I really like the freedom of just firing the wand I want to fire, without having to  select it first. Especially in a heated battle, where I don't need any distractions. It also allows me to use crazy wand combinations, like close combat on #1 and teleport on #2.<br/></p>\n<p>The keys are as follows:<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>LEFT MOUSE:</strong> fire wand#1<br/><strong>RIGHT MOUSE:</strong> fire wand#2<br/><strong>SHIFT:</strong> fire wand#3<br/><strong>R:</strong> fire wand#4<br/><strong>1:</strong> select flask #1<br/><strong>2:</strong> select flask #2<br/><strong>3:</strong> select flask #3<br/><strong>4:</strong> select flask #4<br/><strong>MIDDLE MOUSE:</strong> pour from lastly selected flask<br/><strong>Q:</strong> Select flask slot #1 and pour.<br/><strong>G:</strong> throw lastly selected flask (also use this key to drink from flask)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>ERRORS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The script works by changing the mouse and keyboard input. It's a crude approach, and it has its downsides.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Since the left mouse now auto-selects wand #1, it will also do that in the tab menu. You can no longer double-click to quickly transfer thingies from the wand to the inventory.</p>\n<p>You need to use G instead of right mouse to drink from flask.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T06:50:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f5/5f5ebb2b34fadd45de48b027a5eb09c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kasper Hviid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
