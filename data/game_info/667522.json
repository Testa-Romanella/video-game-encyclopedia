The story takes place in the universe where eight recognized planets including Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are colliding with each other and with other obstacles. It's almost like an explosion in the solar system.\u00a0The gravity varies there, so some planets can float away while some still have gravity to maintain their position. The planets are also lined in order according to their distance to the sun and the size of the planets are scaled down from the real ones.\u00a0 Hope this is fun to play or watch: )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T07:08:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/1426c34207d188fbf73f364a1130e3cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ls4900"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
