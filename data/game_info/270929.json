{"id": 270929, "slug": "maruta-escape", "name": "Maruta Escape", "name_original": "Maruta Escape", "description": "Maruta Escape is a stealth-puzzle game with time-bending action where every second counts\u2014sometimes twice!<br/><br/>You are being held captive in a dystopian human experimentation facility. Your fate as a test subject is sealed unless you escape the drones and robot patrols that lurk around every corner and hunt you from the shadows.<br/><br/>To succeed, you must choose your path carefully, hack your way through security checkpoints and avoid enemy traps as you progress from one challenging level to the next.<br/><br/>When you are caught (and you will be caught!) time slows down. Then, if your time-bending meter is charged, you can activate it to rewind your gameplay and take a new approach, re-tracing your steps and re-thinking your strategy to avoid the clutches of the enemy. But be fast and decisive! You must make your move before your meter runs out and real time catches up with you!<br/><br/>As you race against and through time, evading enemies and delving deeper, you will unravel the mystery of who is responsible for your abduction and learn the evil plans behind the human experiments.<br/><br/>Each level boasts challenges designed specifically to fit its environment. From the sinister surgery room to the foreboding library to the mysterious Zone 19, no two levels are the same. And the game\u2019s dynamic AI lets enemies react differently every time you play a level, leading to hours of challenging gameplay as you try different ways to escape and set new time records for your greatest escape.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:01:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c42e4b887e8729eeb19f409acfcab004_JwAX8NW.jpg", "website": "http://busansanai.com/presskit/index.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["The Label"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["The Label"], "esrb_rating": null}
