Earth could no longer sustain life, so the Aurora Corporation sent out thousands of scouting ships to find a new home for humanity. No ships sent a signal back to earth\u2014except the ACS Echo.\r\n  </p>\n<p>A partial transmission was sent back to confirm an exoplanet candidate, but nobody could find out why. Therefore, the ACS Genesis was sent out to investigate. The crew of the ACS Genesis soon finds out that the transmission sent by the Echo\u2014was one of distress.</p>\n\n\n<p>Genesis was originally published on Steam Greenlight in May 2017. Our greenlight campaign was a huge success and we were lucky enough to be one of the final few games to go through Steam Greenlight before the service shut down and transferred to Steam Direct. However, we simply did not have the funds or the manpower to continue development at the time so development was temporarily halted and saved for later. This is the tech demo that we distributed to Greenlight voters so that they could get an idea of what we wanted Genesis to be. We hope to resume development once we get the necessary funds to do so, in the mean time, check out our awesome tech demo here and <strong>donate some dollars our way if you want to see this project come to life! Every penny counts.</strong>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Genesis is currently built by a two man team, Luke Japaridze of LucasGame Studios and David Kubala of Red Sweater Studios. Luke is a seasoned Unity Developer who has been making games since 2013, he is also the developer of Corona MotorSport, a racing title currently on Steam Early Access. Dave is currently a VR developer and 3d Designer at BuenoBox Architecture and has exceptional command of 3d modeling. Together, we are both more than capable of bringing Genesis to life in the near future.</p>Please donate if you can!
