The theme was \u201cstronger together\u201d.\r\n  </p>\n<p>After vying to never make a 2D game\u2026 I underwent making this 2D game after Tina [who did the game\u2019s art] fielded an interesting premise about senses. Tying this to the theme, I opted to use the senses as a model of something that works better together\u2014while the jam\u2019s theme also provided grounds for the narrative as a whole.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Using Bolt (visual scripting), I underwent making the beast and getting used to 2D. As with my previous jam I\u2019ve learnt a real lot in a short space of time. My greatest lesson this time around was in creating reusable, automated systems by allocating easily accessible variables\u2014which was especially helpful for speedily implementing the dialogue system.\r\n  <br/></p>\n<p>This second jam has been an absolute blast and, despite almost giving up early on due to a wealth of confusion and overwhelm, I learnt a huge amount while producing something which I feel is a marked improvement from my last attempt.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to know your thoughts after playing, so please do drop a comment or get in touch!\r\n  </p>\n<p>You can also check out my first project here: https://cinemaleo.itch.io/sacrifices<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nBuild Details\r\n<p>Made and built for Windows.<br/></p>\n<p>Mac build has been tested, but not by me.
