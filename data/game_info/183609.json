The themes included caveman, time limit and yin and yang. This game is a simple platformer, you must move from beginning to the end while avoiding the cave men, you can attack them however your attack is close range so you must be careful not to be killed yourself.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f47/f47c51d007ea58fd16b2e4c39fabf579.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kirsty"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
