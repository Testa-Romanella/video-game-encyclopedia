That is, a game with graphics \u2013 that doesn't load any! So I started with my old 1k JS game \"Gravity\" (on CodePen) and started replacing minimalist canvas shapes with playful emoji's. There were some challenges in development however; like iOS having 16px max size, no colors on Windows &lt; 10, different rotations on spaceships and general lack of support.</p><p>Fun side-effects of using Emoji are that graphics looks different on almost all platforms and total gzipped load of the game is around 3kiloBytes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67a/67ac298845c6c729fe2b5a2fe48ed610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gadgetgnome"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
