These are not the only ways to beat every level, but they work. <br/>Do not read beyond this point if you don't want spoilers.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Level 1: </strong>Fly right next to the black hole and fire boost beams up into the gravity field. Then, travel back in time and use your own boost beams to boost yourself to the other side.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Level 2: </strong>Shoot as many meteors as you can, then repeatedly travel back in time so you can shoot even more meteors in the limited window before the Earth is destroyed. \u00a0It works best if you divide your selves up between locations. For example, first you go left, then right, then middle, then really high, etc.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Level 3:\u00a0</strong>Just wait until someone starts firing missiles for no reason. There are 5 bunkers, make sure to watch them all. When you see someone firing missiles, either intercept the missiles and destroy them immediately, or travel back in time to destroy them before they can even fire.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Level</strong> <strong>4:\u00a0</strong>Mercury is going to get yeeted into the top-left corner, where it will die. Gently intercept it with your boost beams before it gets there.<br/>If you do this, the level will instead end with Mars and Jupiter crashing into each other, also in the top-left corner. Travel back in time and make sure Mars (or Jupiter) never gets there.<br/>Throughout the level, try to be gentle with the planets, don't get caught on the solar waves yourself, and reset if things get messy. The biggest danger is that you create more problems than you solve.</li></ul>\n<p>Good luck, End-Ender!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T10:40:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39f/39fc5aa23caad1d1e1adcf50cf86898b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sentiant"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
