This includes: better enemy animations, and variation to enemy sprites, environments, and spells.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.2:</strong> Additional enemies update - I had really wanted to add one more enemy to the game; the Shade. The idea for this creature was that it would keep its distance from the player as much as possible, and cast magic that turned certain areas of the playable area into damage zone. This idea was born when I noticed an easy strategy for my game is to simply run in a large circle. The Shade should help to disrupt that behaviour.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.3:</strong> Boss Battle Update - At present, the game does not really have an end. After all the spells are unlocked and some time passes, the \u201cDoom\u201d event happens, but I wanted to work on something beyond that. The idea here is that if the player survives the Doom event for an arbitrary amount of time, then a boss battle begins.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.4:</strong> Procedural maps?\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T06:26:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16d/16dc13b45f7d90ae654ce93c2404bac7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skwyrmyn Wyrm Creations"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
