It wasn't meant to be a romance but there is a tiny bit at the end.</p>\n<p>Three unique backgrounds were planned for the three girls endings but I ran out of time, this has helped me to understand what I can accomplish in a week.</p><p>No music, I haven't figured that out yet.</p>\n<p>I like to believe that I can only improve, please feel free to offer criticisms and advice, thank you for giving my game a try.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T04:13:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e13/e13f711fc0f3716758bbe2c397565f37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jaydalyn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
