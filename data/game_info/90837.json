I highly recommend watching the series Free! \u00a0Iwatobi Swim Club as well as the second season Free! \u00a0Eternal Summer.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out my game :)<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>[26/07/2018]<br/></p>\n<p>Red's note:<br/>I started working on <em>Free! Arabian Nights</em> back in 2015. I took a short hiatus for over a year\u00a0but after 3 years of\u00a0drawing and redrawing sprites, late nights coding, many writer's blocks\u00a0and plenty of moments of <em>Why am I still doing this</em>? I am so happy to finally be able to release a finished version of this game.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em>Free! Arabian Nights</em> is not the first game I have tried to make, but it is without a doubt the first game I have ever finished making. This is thanks to the many people that have supported me, encouraged me, and even nagged me over the years.\u00a0 Thank you.<br/><br/>This game was made by a fan, for the fans, and so I truly genuinely hope that you enjoy this game.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>[16/08/2018]</p><p>Red's note:<br/>Although the game itself is Free!
