{"id": 102202, "slug": "electric-energy-tycoon", "name": "Electric Energy Tycoon", "name_original": "Electric Energy Tycoon", "description": "<p>You're the owner of a new electric power company with an exclusive contract in a city. The city will grow depending on how well you keep it powered.</p>\n<p>Don't grow too quickly though, as the city mayor won't tolerate many power outages before terminating your contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions and tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Build your first power plant away from the starting city block. Citizens dislike living close to power plants, substations and high voltage nodes.</li><li>Connect your power plant to a substation with high voltage lines. The substation lowers the voltage to residential values.</li><li>Connect the substation to the residential areas using low voltage lines, people don't mind these near their houses.</li><li>The city will grow into new blocks and upgrade existing ones much faster into well powered and valued areas.</li><li>The city won't tolerate three power outages in a single month.</li><li>Don't grow your grid too fast at the start of the game, or else the city power demand will get unmanageable quickly.</li><li>If you pollute too much, the city will start imposing penalties by taxing your income.</li><li>Base price per kWh varies each month, by external factors you cannot control.</li><li>You can see the currently powered zones by using the \"POWER\" button on the left.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Missing features (maybe I'll implement them post-jam):<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>More important than anything else: <strong>Balance</strong>. I didn't have enough time to better playtest the game and set enjoyable costs, rates, and other values.</li><li>Saving and loading games.</li><li>Info on city buildings (how much each kind consumes, etc.).</li><li>Some way to demolish existing buildings.</li><li>Random events and offers. These should affect the kWh price, grow rate, and any other variable.</li><li>Not programmer art.</li><li>Music. For now get on Youtube and search for an Instrumental Jazz playlist to play while you play the game.</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Game made for the Ludum Dare 39 compo in about 40 hours.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/79397049f247bd213fa9f2d43ba11f7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
