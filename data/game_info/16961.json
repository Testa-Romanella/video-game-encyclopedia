{"id": 16961, "slug": "space-hack", "name": "Space Hack", "name_original": "Space Hack", "description": "<p>Set in the 23rd Century, Space Hack follows the adventures of the eponymous Hack, a space marine onboard the starship Maximus. Back on Earth, the overpopulation forced the humanity to launch several expeditions to colonize the alien worlds. The game is set on Maximus after it was attacked by the insectoid alien invaders. The levels represent various Earth biospheres contained within the ship.<br />\nJudging by its main gameplay features, Space Hack is, basically, Diablo in space. It\u2019s a straightforward hack-and-slash game that uses the same point-and-click controls and even a level design similar to Diablo. There\u2019s a safe base where you heal your wounds and purchase equipment, and from there you lead Hack through the monster-infested Maximus. Compared to Diablo, the game puts an even stronger emphasis on the combat and has fewer RPG elements. The game has no character selection and no classes. There\u2019s a skill system, but it is your equipment that has the most influence on gameplay. Hack uses a variety of sci-fi firearms that freeze, burn, or explode the alien bugs, as well as melee weapons, armor, and special items. His health regenerates over time, but the process is slow, so the protagonist will require Medpacks to restore HP.</p>", "metacritic": 63, "released": "2004-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T22:13:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac4f75a956266aea8efa640943e5e547.jpg", "website": "http://www.meridian4.com", "rating": 1.72, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 86, "owned": 1759, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 21, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 83, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 83, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meridian4", "Rebelmind"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Meridian4"], "esrb_rating": null}
