Smash your opponents' cars off the field. If the drivers survive, run them down before they steal your car!<br/><br/>SMASH YOUR OPPONENTSThe goal of the rally is to be the last one standing at all costs. Ram, feint, blast, and punch your opponents off the field to claim victory. Drifting into your enemies will add extra punch to your impacts, so drive with some flair! Take care though, the fields are tight and the rally cars are fast.RUN FOR YOUR LIFEIf your car is flipped over or knocked off the field you'll be forced to fight on foot. Rally drivers are recruited based on raw physical strength and incredible martial arts skills, so you can always go fist-to-bumper with the cars. Just don't get run over!CARE PACKAGESCrates with weapons and tools are regularly teleported into the rally to keep things interesting. Use the dual hood-mounted machine guns to mow down enemy drivers, the jet engine to ram other cars with that little something extra, or the mysterious Airheart device to disappear temporarily.LIFE AFTER DEATHAs soon as a driver is disqualified -- by death -- he or she returns as a catapult loaded with explosive barrels. Rain fire and chaos on your former friends to score extra points with the judges!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9c1612b4cbd943d72f5913f4dffcb77.jpg", "website": "http://www.typicalentertainment.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Typical Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Typical Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
