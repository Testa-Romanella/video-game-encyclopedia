Complete each level by collecting all of the apples. As you progress through each level, you'll find increasing difficulty presented in different ways. More apples, of course, and as a result, a longer snake to manage.\u00a0Also, levels have a variety of obstacles which are intended to provide unique challenges.</p>\r\nWhy Snake?\r\n<p>I wanted to go back to my game dev roots, where I was building snake-like games on the Apple IIe with it's blocky large pixel resolution layout. This game is exactly the kind of thing I would have built back then, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The following music was used for this media project:</p>\n<p>Music: 1984 by Frank Schroeter</p>\n<p>Free download: https://filmmusic.io/song/7742-1984</p>\n<p>License (CC BY 4.0): https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Artist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/frank.schroeter.52</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T17:26:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec3/ec3495dd40745ed0629f188041171699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andrew Hoyer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
