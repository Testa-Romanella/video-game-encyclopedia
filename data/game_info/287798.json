Velez)", "description": "<p>Together is about a pair of slimes who fall off a cliff on their way home. As a result, they must traverse through the dangerous woods, which is filled to the brim with dangerous monsters and deadly traps. Fortunately, they have nothing to fear as long as they stay together. To play this game, Player One must use the WASD keys to move, while Player Two must use the arrow keys to move. When both players are close, a barrier will form around them, which will protect them from harm. If they get too far apart, however, the barrier will be gone and they will be exposed to dangerous threats.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T03:59:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62c/62ccec68384d7d6eced950c9b5c4e030.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ricardo M.
