You're here to paint the town! However, this isn't your regular style of painting. In Color Town, you're armed with nothing but a color bomb, a spring, and your timing skills. Do you have what it takes to aim, fire, and paint the town?<br/><br/>Color Town is the casual gaming experience that tests your focus, your aim, and your ability to pull the trigger! As you fire each color bomb at the town, every target you hit covers it in beautiful paint that brings it to life. The more accurate you are, the higher the score you get, and if you miss? The town doesn't get colored! It's not as easy as it sounds because these whacky towns are always on the move. You need to aim, wait for the perfect moment, and take your shot.<br/><br/>So, strap in for the coloring experience of a lifetime, because in Color Town, we say down with the pens and up with the color. It's time to paint the town!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T02:43:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ef/1ef3caa8aa7450990fa19f9d956b526a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Harmonybit"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Harmonybit"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
