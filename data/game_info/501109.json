True story.<br/></p>\n<p>Game has been made in Unity in approx 12 hours. The \u201cart\u201d took most of the time. I used sfxr for the sound effects, but as I am even worse musician than designer, there\u2019s no music.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>Player controls a beaver who has to catch raindrops and pour the water back into the river before it runs completely dry and all the fish are dead.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A or left arrow to go left D or right arrow to go right</p>\n<p>Should also work with gamepad, I haven\u2019t tested it however.</p>\n<p>The bucket is emptied automatically when player is on the edge.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it for at least a few minutes.<br/>ondy1985<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:01:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aa77959636ca95cd4a72d6d6389064e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ondy1985"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
