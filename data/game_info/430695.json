But don't get hit by those pesky track blocks those buggers put up!</p>\n<p>Oh and don't get killed by those buggers either. I gave you a nifty revolver to take care of both problems</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement<br/>Mouse - Look<br/>Left Mouse Button - Shoot<br/>R - Reload<br/>E - Interact<br/>Left Ctrl - Crouch<br/>Left Shift - Sprint</p>\n<p>Control the speed of the train, slower and more vulnerable to the enemy, faster and you hurt the engine and burn more fuel, but those enemies can't catch up.<br/>Refuel the engine to keep the fire alive - if the flame goes out (or your train is destroyed, but who cares about that) you lose!<br/>Fuel is in the fuel cart in the back</p>\n<p>I had no time to test the balance of anything, please let me know if something is whack!
