{"id": 842218, "slug": "car-drift-dynamic", "name": "Car Drift Dynamic", "name_original": "Car Drift Dynamic", "description": "What is Dynamic Drift :\r\n<p>Dynamic Drift is just the beginning of an era of non-stop car drifting, where you go full throttle with nitro and dive into this fever of drifting.\u00a0 It supports any types of controllers ( Mobile, Keyboard, XBOX and PS4\u00a0) in order to make your best drifting experience.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Get ready to drive high-performance cars and make them drift at high speed in tracks designed specifically for drifting. Drift Points grow proportionally to drift angle, drift time and speed. If points reach every multiple of 100 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the another (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1. Proximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor. If you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers. The\u00a0Drifting\u00a0 Game is also combined with stunning visuals and high-fidelity graphics.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Improve your racing and drifting skills. Get ready for the most Realistic and Exciting Drift Experience of all time. If you are in the mood for drifting, you came to the right place. It\u2019s always drifting time!
