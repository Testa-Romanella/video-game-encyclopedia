You will fight many hostile creatures as you navigate the <strong>three distinct regions</strong> surrounding the city. <strong>Gather ore and gain coins</strong> to spend on <strong>upgrades</strong> when you return home. While you're there, chat with the <strong>local inhabitants</strong> and get to know them. This is Project: NEO. (and did we mention, it\u2019s completely <strong>free to play!</strong>)<h3>Features</h3>- An immersive world <br/>- 5 different environments<br/>- Randomly generated map layouts<br/>- Gather resources<br/>- Upgrade gear<br/>- A local community you can interact with<br/>- And so much more!<h3>Developer Notes</h3>Project: NEO was created by a small team of passionate developers over the course of a few months. Considering it's the first game we have created on our own, we are proud and confident in how our <strong>project</strong> turned out. However, we are also aware that the game is not perfect, but as we worked through it we treated it as a learning experience to grow our skills so that we can create games that provide the exact experience a gamer wants in their game. We hope you enjoyed this little <strong>project</strong> we put together. -Project: NEO Team", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T06:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cd/6cd7adf1d2dc72ba30d73687164b22fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick Corbi", "Daniel Penner", "Matthew Minnett"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NIck Corbi", "Daniel Penner", "Matthew Minnett"], "esrb_rating": null}
