Each player has 3 life points.</p>\n<p>You can send 3 different types of waves, but you cannot send more than 1 wave per second. The slower the wave, the higher the number of bounces.</p>\n<p>The first player to score 3 points wins the duel.</p>\n<p>This game was made as part of the Global Game Jam 2017 @ ICAN (Paris) on the theme \"Waves\".
