She is battling alone against hordes of zombies, mutants, and killer robots with only her ever-evolving mental powers to protect her. Will she survive the sinister onslaught or is she destined to become just another victim of an evil, unfathomable intelligence?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cy is an exciting retro, roguelite arcade shooter with crunchy pixel-art graphics that's sure to get the dopamine flowing.  It's inspired by Vampire Survivors and other casual, bullet heaven, roguelite, survivor-likes (Spellbook: Demonslayers, Rogue Genesia, and Nomad Survival are some other faves), ancient arcade classics such as Robotron 2084, and the upgrade system is influenced by action RPGs (like the Diablo series, Grim Dawn, and Last Epoch). Unlike other offerings in the genre, instead of a choice of random ability upgrades available when leveling up, the player has full control of how Cy's stats will develop. You can also unlock your choice of starting powers.<br/><br/>Community input is important to us. Please make bug reports or feature requests on our discord server or on the community page.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Early access features 2 of 4 planned levels and 4 of Cy's 7 planned powers.
