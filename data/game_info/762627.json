All assets (excepting the player sprite, which is based on a public domain sprite sheet by Glacialan, linked below, and the grass sprite, which is\u00a0 from GRASS+ by SciGho, also linked below) were created by me during LD50. Most of the programming was done in 4 hours, but then I took some breaks and fixed some issues and here we are almost 20 hours afterwards. The good news is, I'm\u00a0<em>99</em><em>%</em> sure that this is a working game. (The 1% is Mac and Linux support since I can only test Windows right now.)</p>\n<p>Sprite sheet:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/8x8-character-and-sprite-sheet<br/>GRASS+: https://ninjikin.itch.io/grass</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T16:59:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/574/574a9c9e4807e38e9897e43f31a1d78d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MineRobber9000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
