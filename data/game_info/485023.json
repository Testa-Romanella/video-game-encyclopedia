During this period, Rome grew from a small country with less than 150,000 people on the edge of Europe to a dazzling empire that annexed Italy, swept the Mediterranean, and dominated Europe.<br/><br/>Rome was not built in a day. From a small geographic country to the European Empire, Rome has risen in change and transformation: from the equal distribution of land among citizens to the replacement of small land ownership; from the single storage of gold to the creation of inflation to increase fiscal revenue; From the cruel suppression of Christians to the unity of church and state; from the democratic republic system to a highly centralized imperial head of state. During this period, the population of Rome increased hundreds of times and its territory expanded thousands of times.<br/><br/>\u3000\u3000 The rise and fall of a country largely depends on whether the country\u2019s wealth emerges to meet the people\u2019s self-affirmation needs. The success of ancient Rome lies in the comprehensive support of political evolution and wealth distribution, religious development and military growth, and the reasonable and effective distribution of wealth greatly determines the normal operation of other elements. Rome\u2019s transition from republic to monarchy, from democracy to despotism is not a historical coincidence, but an optimal choice after weighing pros and cons and multi-party games. But even so, ancient Rome eventually decayed and split. The reason was not simply the incompetence of the last emperor and the unforeseen natural and man-made disasters. In fact, when the country developed to a certain degree, the accumulation of national wealth and the huge demand for self-affirmation of the country Balance led to various social contradictions that began to highlight and continued to intensify, eventually leading to the decline and overturning of the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>\u3000\u3000 Throughout its development process, ancient Rome used four main methods of aggression and expansion, building roads to promote foreign expansion, overdrafting the future, and developing religions to achieve the collection and circulation of wealth in multiple and multi-dimensional ways to meet people's self-affirmation needs. But these four methods played different roles in the development of Rome.<br/><br/>        In the long history, the ancient Roman era has already left us.
