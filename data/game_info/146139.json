Ever since technology started going crazy, those skeletal soldiers don't pose much of a threat anymore. That's why you decided to upgrade your troops with the same technology!

Make your way to the stairs to reach the next floor, and try not to get caught by the rebelling undead.</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys to move.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/477/477254aef20acf573d880c9e40af5fc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solanima"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
