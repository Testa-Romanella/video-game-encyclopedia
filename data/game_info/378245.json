You can't avoid the mayhem now, can you anymore. It's only a matter of time before they get you. Until then, I'll be watching. Waiting. I'll be there every moment until your demise. You provoked us. Now there's no putting us back.</p>\n<p>This game was inspired by P. T. It is my first game made with unity, and it isn't that good. There's not much plot, but since it's a prequel, I guess, I may remake it. It's part of a series i'm calling \"The Lonesome Ones\" Quadrilogy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T05:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e41cd25d213bfdba2467f757f9017a71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["REEE2752"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
