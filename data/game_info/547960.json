It uses an ImageEffect shader and CommandBuffers to light selected SpriteRenderers in the scene. It works on a per pixel basis for all screen pixels that are part of\u00a0a SpriteRenderer marked as lighting target.\u00a0Supports multiple scene cameras, multiple sun sources and multiple lit SpriteRenderers. Light sources have a radius of origin, a radius of maximal influence, but can also have a mask texture that determines how light intensity is supposed to fall off the further a lit object is away from the source.\u00a0Effect fidelity is adjustable in the ImageEffect materials settings (and inverse correlated to performance).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T10:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b6/9b60ad0071d23ca5fa2af379c5fbfb2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FMProductions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
