The game is simple, and has little challenge, but i made it to show my thanks for my C# teacher: Ryan, who is the same age as me. Ryan, thank you for teaching me about coding, though this game can hardly be called fun, it just shows how much i have learnt from you. I understand there is much more to this, but all in all, thank you for getting me into game development, life wouldn't be the same. :D</p><p>thanks for playing!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2b/e2b003f4401318cba137abcac84118dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EricC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
