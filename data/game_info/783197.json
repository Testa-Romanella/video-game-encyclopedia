The first is a frantic bullet hell shmup that takes place in the air. Once the player collects weapon resources in the air, they can plunge below the surface in search of alien technology. The underwater portions are a slower and exploration-focused. We had an ambitious idea and didn't quite pull it off within the original 48hrs. We did spend some time after the jam brining it to its current state.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Programmers</strong><br/>Tyson Villeneuve<br/>Kelsey Villeneuve<br/>Justin Villeneuve\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Aritsts</strong><br/>Avery Andrykew<br/>Bianca Candalera<br/>Megan Choi<br/>Jade Cunniffe<br/>Jacob Purdie<br/>Wesland Turney<br/>Emily Tworek<br/>Hansen Wei Cottrell\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Writer</strong><br/>Baljot Bhatti\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T11:22:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/8611ca7e37ee431b5fa58d6ef8840fed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Developers Synonymous"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
