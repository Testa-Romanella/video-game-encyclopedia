Clear the way\u00a0 for their spaceship and bring them safe and sound to their new earth. But beware: You only have a limited amount of actions you can do. Plan wisely!</p>\n<p>And let us hope that they won't destroy the next planet too...</p>\r\nNote:\u00a0\r\n<p>The last \"level\" might be a bit confusing, since the\u00a0 camera does not zoom out like it does in all the other level.
