Absorb enemy fire to unlock powerful abilities, unlock story sequences and much more!\r\n\r\nIn the year 2010, Earth received a signal from the Cygnus region of the Milky Way from a hostile collective of extra terrestrials that refer to themselves as the HUSK. With the threat of their invasion looming, Earth used the 102,492 hour warning (11 years) to focus their efforts to prepare and develop technology to thwart the incoming dark omen. The Husk arrive and shatter the Earth into pieces leaving the entire country of The United States drifting as asteroids throughout the solar system. Citizens of the country survive thanks to false atmospheres installed on all regions of the country. Now their only hope lies with the President of the United States equipped with his shoulder cannon and proton sabre to bring all of the asteroids together and become the United Space of America and crush the invading HUSK forces.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T10:15:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/675b518f4f1a60e6f8674ccbda11d8e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fractured Earth"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fractured Earth"], "esrb_rating": null}
