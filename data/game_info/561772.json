Just used the name so that its kinda special lol. This was my first game jam, I have been learning unreal engine for the past 2.5 months. In this game, you control a pawn and you have to hit the blue squares. Doing that, your friends are spawned and they follow you and help you to destroy more blue squares. This is how it fits the theme \"Stronger Together\", if you are together with your friends, you get more points and hence, you are stronger. However, if you hit the red ones, the scores will keep on decreasing until you reach 0. If you are zero, and then if you hit, you lose lol xDDD</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have experienced some bugs in the game such as sometimes the blue cubes are not effected by the friends.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0tried my best\u00a0to fix it, but \u00a0since I am just a beginner to unreal, I\u00a0was not able to do that. So, I\u00a0have uploaded the project files for the unreal users. It would be so cool of you to download this and improve this game! :))</p>\n\n<p>Wanna tell me something bout the game?\u00a0\u00a0DM me on Twitter, link here:\u00a0(1) Krrish Dhiman (@KrrishDhiman4) / Twitter\u00a0@KrrishDhiman4</p>\n\n\n<p>Thanks &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:42:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d1673b8012cbf760b468d3854a89c2a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KrrishCaterpiller"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
