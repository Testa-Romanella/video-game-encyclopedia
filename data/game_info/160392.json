The goal of the game is to eat as many bugs as possible. A bug must match a spider in color and symbol to be eaten by that spider. Eating a spiked bug, eating a bug with the wrong color/symbol, or letting five non-spiked bugs leave the right side of the screen result in a game over.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by Jacob Stone</p>\n<p>Art by Jacob Stone and Amanda Williams</p>\n<p>Code by Jacob Stone</p>\n<p>SFX by Jacob Stone<br/></p>\n<p>Music by Arielle Taylor</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5b9fab3be249dc46d3381610c63b501.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["roo_csc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
