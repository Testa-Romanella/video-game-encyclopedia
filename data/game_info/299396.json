And millions of millions of them have planets. With this sea of opportunities, there is one thing we need to do: Play galactic Gravity Golf!<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>Use W and S to aim and A and D to set your power - and then press SPACE to\u00a0shoot that little ball across the universe! Use the gravitational pull of the planets to get the ball into the hole.</p>\n<p>More Details:</p>\n<p>The game includes 18 holes. There is no stroke limit, but if you are stuck at a level you can skip it. But a skip will add 15 strokes to your score.</p>\n<p>Each level has a collectible star that is more or less difficult to collect. Each star counts as two stars because of some stuff in Unity that I don't quite understand....</p>\n<p>The game saves your progress\u00a0 so you can pick up where you left at any time.</p>\n<p>Extra feature: You can pick between two soundtracks: calm and energetic. You can do so in the start screen or in the pause menu. Why? Because I myself couldn't decide which music fits better so I am outsourcing the decision to you!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Blackthornprod Game Jam 2019, theme: Miniature Planets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T05:11:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9a37d03f5ec4ebddba8ef204c10035f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pidibidi"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
