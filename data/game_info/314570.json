This is a action zombie like game where you go around shooting zombies and try to get the highest score possible. Some things still need to be added for example zombie models and a scoreboard however. I feel as its the best course of action to get views from other people first to change certain stuff or add new elements.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance if you do test this out. :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T06:44:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/942c58448d394deacd867077ef9e511c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["0utcast18"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
