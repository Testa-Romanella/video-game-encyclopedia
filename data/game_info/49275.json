No sooner had it been declared in May 1948 than it became involved in a struggle for survival, fighting its neighbours in a ferocious clash. This was the first Arab-Israeli war, but it would be far from the last.<br />\nShifting Sands traces the history of the successive Arab-Israeli conflicts: from the sidelines of the Suez crisis, through the lightning Six-Day War, the guerilla-like War Of Attrition and the strategic surprise of the Yom Kippur War, all the way to the historic Osirak raid and the epic air battle over the Bekaa Valley.<br />\nThe campaign covers both the battles that happened and the clashes that did not, but could have; all of them snapshots of the ever-shifting sands of a fragile balance in arguably the most violently fluid region of the planet since WW2.<br />\nFEATURES<br />\nA standalone expansion for Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations, 2013&#39;s Digital Wargame of the Year: play as a single, separate game, or add it to your collection of scenarios for CMANO.<br />\n17 campaign scenarios (14 historical and 3 hypothetical) written by Paul A.
