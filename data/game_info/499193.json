The instructions and credits are in the game itself. Also sorry to plague you with a download, webGL just didn't like me. Also. though this may not be a great game I\u00a0hope someone has at least a little fun playing it.</p>\n<p>How to play (it's in the game as well):</p>\n<p>WASD to move your car, collect souvenirs like mugs and boomerangs to earn points. Go to your home base to deposit those points and if you have over 200 at the start you get another 60 seconds. From then on you need another [previous 200 or number]\u00a0+ 200 + 100 to get 60 more seconds. Your max speed increases every 1000 points. You also have to collect gas to continue driving around.</p>\n<p>This game was supposed to be a collection game\u00a0where you had to\u00a0collect certain souvenirs to in under 60 seconds to\u00a0upgrade your car and improve your score\u00a0next time, it was supposed to look nice with all the places\u00a0and have lotsa features. I don't know what I was thinking. I'm new to game development, this is the first game I have ever finished and I'm proud of it. Many of the things I wanted to get done did get done, though it doesn't look too great - there are plenty of bugs and playing it gets dull after a bit. None the less I learned all sorts of things such as: health bars, pause menus, main menus, sound, movement, etc...</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>I made all the 3d assets except for the car, that was made by kenny. The sky is the free all sky pack from the unity asset store. All sounds except for the car engine\u00a0are from freesound - credited in game. That along with the music.</p>\n<p>Things I\u00a0think I could do better:</p>\n<p>Multiplayer?</p>\n<p>More souvenirs.</p>\n<p>Better surroundings.</p>\n<p>RV instead of race car.</p>\n<p>Variety of buildings.</p>\n<p>More animations.</p>\n<p>Nicer looking UI and or game in general.</p>\n<p>My sleep schedule.</p>\n<p>My game development skills.</p>\n<p>There's plenty I'm missing, tell me what you think... I just wish that I was better at game development because if I knew what I was doing from the start I would probably have a much cooler game.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway if you read the whole thing and got here thanks for reading... If you want comment what Brackeys tutorials you think I followed to make this game. Also, though this may not be a great game I\u00a0hope someone has at least a little fun playing it.</p>\n\n<p>Also sorry for the download webGL wasn't working and I need to go to bed.</p>\n<p>Hopefully I\u00a0will be able to add webGL later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:37:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/483/483e5277b43b68761c9a4d8a3e662da4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ASquareWatermelon"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
