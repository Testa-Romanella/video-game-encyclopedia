But not your typical Joe the Caveman. You are a respected and  prestigious <strong>Painter the Caveman</strong>. Under a sudden inflow of inspiration, you decide to mark the walls of a cave with a beautiful <strong>painting </strong>of a deer. Or maybe a bear? A beaver?<br/></p>\n<p>Whatever it is, you feel inspired and full of creative energy as you enter the cave and <strong>begin your descent</strong> into the unknown...<br/></p>\n<p>This project was made in <strong>under four days</strong>, and is my first ever submission to a ten day game jam. Yes, I joined a jam four days before my vacation trip, so I had to speed things up. Still, I am very proud of this little project and I had a lot of fun putting it together. Please share your thoughts down below!<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck, and have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T14:52:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b7/9b775025ad4c774c4080e95a615a559c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pilleow"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
