Set in a valley filled with trees the land is ready to be molded into a garden of fruits and flowers. The player not only needs to control the actions of their swarms but they need to be attentive to the environment as it will, no doubt, die without their input. The swarms that the player controls have basic actions; Build, Collect, and Nurse. Bees have a mechanical simplicity to their actions and the player needs to tap into that to improve their environment. The player will have up to 4 swarms per type of bee. They will then spend time developing their environment and keeping their environment however they see fit.</p><p><strong>Send all inquiries to beewilderedgame@gmail.com</strong></p><p><strong>Check us out on Facebook and Twitter!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67b/67b73ecaccdb0ea68b8769fa94d2849a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BeeWildered"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
