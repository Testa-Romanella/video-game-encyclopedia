{"id": 731932, "slug": "rune-sea", "name": "Rune Sea", "name_original": "Rune Sea", "description": "<p>A WIP game done in RPG Maker in the spirit of my favorite final fantasy games. This version uses Final Fantasy naming conventions for the sake of testing mechanics and gameplay and fleshing things out.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The Rune Sea is the source of magic between worlds and the basis for those worlds' construction. From Matter to natural laws, the Rune Sea governs it all.<br/><br/>Sometimes the tides of the Rune Sea shift greatly in an event called a Wyrd Wake. In these events, the Rune Sea will connect two worlds in its waves and cause strange and world-changing phenomena in both worlds.<br/><br/>These phenomena include minor, seamless events like shifting people into alternate timelines or universes of their own world, such as the infamous Mandela Effect. They also include catastrophic events such as the Chernobyl Disaster, the Tunguska Event, and the Donora Death Fog. But the most dramatic of these events are prophetic events where people aren't just shifted in their own universe but pulled into the rune sea by the Wyrd Wake and swept along from trough to crest and thrown into another world altogether.<br/><br/>These powerful moments in time come rarely but when they do there is no rhyme or reason on who is pulled in. Often this brings average people into worlds where they are seen as gods and gods to worlds where they are as laymen.<br/><br/>It is in such a situation where our main character is swept from their comfy modern life into a fantasy world like those in their favorite games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T13:39:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b3/9b34d90b67e49d207c16984c0e7b1126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheFlerffyBurr"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
