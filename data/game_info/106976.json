It leans so much into a 2d game that I just wanted to make something, anything based on it. So I created this and the Lunar Lander Clone. It originally was going to contain an easter egg that required you to collect certain hidden items and then find a puzzle hidden within the credits that would have led you to figure out the egg in the Infinite Runner, but I ran out of time and cancelled that idea.... Maybe next time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f79/f79b1950c30db881ebf1f8bbcb927803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gun Asylem"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
