I made this project essentially to learn l\u00f6ve and experiment other things than unity.</p>\n<p>In a world at war, your base has been invaded by enemies. A rescue ship is here to gather all the citizens and evacuate them, and you are a commander who manage the defense through a computer screen.</p>\n<ul><li>Use the <strong>left click</strong> to build\u00a0turrets on the map that will\u00a0defend the ship, until all citizens are gathered. Killing enemies make you gain money in order to build stronger turrets.</li><li>Use the <strong>right/left arrows</strong> to switch the current turret profile.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>None of the assets in the project are mine, i used free game resources you can find on itchio or else.
