{"id": 56473, "slug": "the-farmers-daughter", "name": "The Farmer's Daughter", "name_original": "The Farmer's Daughter", "description": "<p>The Farmer's Daughter is an erotic text-based video game for the Commodore 64 produced by Nocturnal Software and written by R.W. Fisher and D.W.J. Sarhan. The video game was produced in 1983 for the Commodore 64 and was released in 2002 for personal computers running MS-DOS.</p>\n<p>The player's character is a traveling lightning rod salesman whose car breaks down near an old farmhouse. At the house, the player is met at the door by the title character, a gorgeous young girl who disappears from sight as soon as he asks to use the phone. While rummaging through the house the player finds her diary and learns which objects need to be collected to make her wildest sexual fantasy come true. While avoiding various pitfalls including her oversexed brothers, her father (who thinks the character is a revenuer) and his dog, the objects described are collected leading to a final encounter with the farmer's daughter in the hayloft. The game is timed by movements so that all objectives must be completed in 180 moves, lest the player miss the tow truck and lose the game.</p>\n<p>The game is a fairly standard text-based adventure, and despite its risque subject matter there are no visuals.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df7c60d13104bca0a5a08d16d1a26357.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Nocturnal Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nocturnal Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
