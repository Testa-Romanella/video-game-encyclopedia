In this snowboarding game, how you interact with the environment, will have effects on the music. For example, if you slow down and hit an obstacle, the music may also play in slow motion. Obstacles and tracks will be generated randomly. This game does not require you to beat a time but instead is meant to be enjoyed by speeding down a mountain, ambient lighting, music, colors, etc... There are two modes (3 minute mode or infinite mode). This game can be played primarily with just the mouse (isn't that relaxing?) But of course, I added some other controls to help.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Once the game starts, click the game container to lock your mouse to the container.<br/></strong></li><li><strong>w \u00a0- give yourself a little boost (if you're stuck but gravity in the game helps also).<br/></strong></li><li><strong>s - slow down<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Space - jump (you have to have the board completely on the ground)<br/></strong></li><li><strong>p - pause </strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T08:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f5228b3331747f3643b5d42d846f049.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryuu_365", "Eliphant"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
