Please feel free to provide feedback and suggestions regarding the game as well. Hopefully this will lead to us making bigger and better game projects in the future as well.

It's a short visual novel that has a few good moments as the game unfolds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f1/6f161b52c8f7f17eb281846a341cb6d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Racist Ranger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
