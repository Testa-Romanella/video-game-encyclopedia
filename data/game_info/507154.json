These included 2.5D reboots of Golden Axe, Altered Beast, and Streets of Rage, as well as an endless runner version of Shinobi, all encompassed in a universal hub world. <br/><br/>Sadly SEGA Studios Australia\u2019s doors were shuttered in 2013, and with it the SEGA Reborn project was lost to the annals of video game history. <br/><br/>Until now. <br/><br/><br/><br/>On the occasion of SEGA\u2019s 60th Anniversary, as a special treat to say \u201cThank You!\u201d to our fans, SEGA is releasing a working prototype of Golden Axe Reborn, a single level created as proof-of-concept, or what\u2019s known in the industry as a \u201cvertical slice.\u201d  We\u2019ve dubbed it, tongue in cheek, as \u201cGolden Axed.\u201d  <br/><br/>Golden Axed offers a unique glimpse into the prospect of a project that could have been, and a rare peek behind the curtain at the sometimes tumultuous world of video game development. <br/><br/>We reached out to some of the original development team to bring this dusty gem to light, and they are proud that this project could be revived in some form to be shared with you, the fans.<h3>*Available until 10am PST / 6PM BST October 19th*</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc064ab715ba4195ac6d26250218e307.jpg", "website": "http://www.sega60th.com", "rating": 2.52, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 58, "owned": 1296, "beaten": 19, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 43, "suggestions_count": 363, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 44, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SEGA", "The Eccentric Ape"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
