{"id": 361965, "slug": "trone", "name": "TRONE", "name_original": "TRONE", "description": "<p>A one-button Tron clone for 2-4 local players. Choose a letter key when the game starts and then press it whenever the steering wheel points in your direction of choice. You have no control over the steering wheel, so the game is all about timing your inputs to when the correct action is available.</p>\n<p>If you steer along the line you're already travelling, you will speed up or slow down for a short amount of time.</p>\n<p>Picking up items messes with the steering wheels of your opponents. You can freeze, slow down, speed up or reverse their steering wheels, and you can disable one of their sectors.</p>\n<p>You get one score point for each opponent who crashes before you.</p>\n<p>ESC quits the game.</p>\n<p>Full screen is strongly recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Design and Programming \u2014 Martin Ender and Lukas Niemeier</li></ul>\n<p>Made with Unity. The only Unity asset we used was\u00a0DOTween. In game font: 8 BIT WONDER. Sound effects created with Bfxr.</p>\n<p>You can find the source code on GitHub.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:02:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22b7d6015bb4cec91e5ef344aa75c4ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Menderbug"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
