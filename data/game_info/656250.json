Read their minds and construct their dream burger before they leave your sight. Watch out though, because if you can't pay your taxes then the kiosk will be shut down!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Brain Scan - E</p>\n<p>Pickup/Drop/Press\u00a0Buttons\u00a0- Left-Click</p>\n<p>Throw - Right-click</p>\n<p>Crouch - Shift</p>\n<p>Options - Escape</p>\n<p>_________________________________</p>\n<p>Detailed Instructions:</p>\n<p>Press E to see what burger each person wants, then build said burger using the materials in your kiosk. After completing your burger throw it at the customer who wanted it to make money.\u00a0\u00a0When you run out of an ingredient\u00a0that you need, press the red button to restock.\u00a0Restocking will cost money.
