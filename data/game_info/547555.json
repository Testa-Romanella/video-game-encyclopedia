Your goal is to save the human that you are inside by collecting red blood cells and completing the levels in order to defeat the viruses.<br/></p>\r\nADD TO YOUR STEAM WISHLIST\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Your physics are similar to a marble in that you'll roll in order to travel. You'll use your momentum to go up inclines and control your momentum when going down inclines. The controls of the game are very easy to learn but the levels are what make it fun and challenging!<br/></p>\r\nHow to Win\r\n<p>Each level contains a set number of red blood cells which you will collect. In order to advance to the next level you must collect all of the red blood cells on a given level. Your HUD shows a counter which tells how many blood cells you have left to collect.<br/></p>\r\nDon't Die!\r\n<p>There are two ways to die in this game, either by falling off a platform or getting hit by a virus. If you die on a level you will restart that specific level. There are no checkpoints within a level, which provides a fun challenge and more satisfaction when you win!<br/></p>\r\nChallenging and Fun\r\n<p>Every level is different and the farther you progress the more unique the levels become. While the mechanics stay the same throughout the game, each level provides different trials that you'll have to learn in order to progress.</p>\r\nJOIN THE VIRUS DISCORD\r\nSIGN UP FOR THE VIRUS NEWSLETTER\r\n\r\nDownload and Run\r\n<p>Download and open the zip folder.
