ESC returns to the menu or quits the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Current State of the\u00a0Game</strong></p>\n<p>I'll consider it finished for now! It's my first finished, published game ever and I\u00a0hope you'll enjoy it!</p>\n<ul><li>Your ship's movement and shooting is recorded like a time trial ghost.</li><li>You can't collide with enemies - right now, you're basically operating \"outside\"\u00a0of the timeline so they can't hit you.</li><li>When you reach the end of the enemy armada (be patient, there's lots of them), you'll automatically fly into a warp zone.</li><li>This resets everything and spawns your most recent ghost, who will then replay your previous actions.</li><li>Ghosts are unlimited, so to beat the game you need to rewind until you\u00a0finally manage to destroy all UFOs.</li><li>Your highest completion per difficulty (if you quit shortly before a warp) or your lowest warps needed to win (if you managed to destroy everything)\u00a0are\u00a0kept in a highscore table</li><li>There might be some stuttering of the objects on screen, which may or may not be an unfortunate side-effect of Godot's current physics implementation - that'll likely get better with future versions of the engine.</li><li>Impossible mode gets really crazy and might be really tedious - you have been warned!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Attribution</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made entirely in Godot Engine v3.0.6-stable\u00a0https://godotengine.org/</p>\n<p>Graphics and sound effects by Kenney of https://www.kenney.nl/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Menu Font created on\u00a0https://textcraft.net/</p>\n<p>Music by Kevin MacLeod:<br/></p>\n<p>Phantom from Space Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Darkling Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18b/18bd9347d348e15543b62801f37fd1b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["PetePete1984"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
