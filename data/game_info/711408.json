In the unlimited mode, there is the possibility of an automatic solution. As you progress through the levels, the graph\u00a0 complexity grows - in the constrained mode it grows faster!</p><p>Sometimes graphs can be generated in an already planar image - this is more likely only at early levels (cause of\u00a0small amount of number and vertices) - well, a freebie\u00a0level :)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Black vertices are not movable (and clicking on them is not taken into account in the mode with restrictions )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80f8153a11f58b80ff6d26631f41c2d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mdaush Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
