This is the first vn I've attempted to make in 6 years. Or at least the first one I've scripted more than 4 lines for.</p>\n<p>It's nowhere near finished yet. The plot is barely scratched on. It's just little scenes between the protagonists that made me think, \"Oh, I really like them together. I want to make more of their story in future.\"</p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p>A Bouquet For My Botanical Darling is a vn that pokes fun at magical girl tropes and gives them a realistic teen/ya edge. Plus there are sapphics.</p>\n<p>My intention was to do a lot more with this, but the week got away from me so this is a very incomplete version of the game. If things feel vague or confusing - I'm sorry! I wasn't able to explain everything as well as I wanted to. I plan to continue working on this in future though, and actually get into more of the magical girl hijinks and romance. If you find something in here that you like, keep an eye out for any future updates!</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who tries out the game, as broken and incomplete as it may be!</p>\n\n<p>DISCLAIMER: ALL ASSETS (MUSIC AND BACKGROUNDS) ARE ROYALTY-FREE. ARTWORK IS MY OWN.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T12:23:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/ddd5b1c2e48b270503766ef9a5634da6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["love-killed-the-superstar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
