You do this by matching your pieces with theirs - if any clump of units contains three matching copies of the good guys, then they pop and score points, taking out any corresponding baddies at the same time!</p>\n\n<p>If you reach the back of the board, all remaining enemies are defeated, netting you big points, and advancing you on to the next level!</p>\n\r\nThese are your units, the cavalry, archer, mage, rogue and knight.\r\n\n\r\nThese are the enemy units, cavalry, archer, mage, rogue and knight.\r\n<p>I'd like to build on the game more in the future, with potentially the following content:<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>Audio</li><li>Scoreboards</li><li>Increasing difficulty</li><li>Different enemy design</li><li>New enemies</li><li>More backgrounds</li><li>Bosses</li><li>and loads more, I can't keep listing them all!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T06:07:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48e3484b75251b98f7b1ae1042c3a3f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["BaronNobody"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
