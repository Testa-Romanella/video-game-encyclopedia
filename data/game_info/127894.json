You can either get stuck in the cycle of grief or leave for good. We were inspired by how similarly we felt after our past relationships ended.<br/></p><p>The game received a lot of great responses that ranged from smiles and laughter to feelings of awkwardness from people who learned something new about their partner. The aim of the game is to increase conversation about painful experiences in relationships and to show people that what they feel during these times is normal and universal.<br/></p><p><strong>Use your keyboard and mouse to play.</strong><br/></p><p>Credits:</p><ul><li>Catt Small: game design, code, art</li><li>Chris Algoo: game design, music &amp; SFX</li><li>Asia Hoe: art, game design</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/994/994c0f2f62bc3b624a83860d931abd4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Catt Small"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
