Both players must have an iPhone with a network connection (wifi or 4G) and with this app installed. Moreover, they must agree to play an online game at the same time, opposing to each other.<br/><br/>The first time you launch the game, you will be assigned an unique numeric player code. This code will be stored on your iPhone, and it will always be used to identify you, every time you will launch the game. It is always shown on the upper text box.<br/><br/>To start a game, just hit the Start New Game button, and the system will try to find an opponent for you. The match is not immediately granted: it will depend on the presence on the network of at least one player looking for an opponent player. Maybe you have to wait for some time before finding a match.<br/><br/>When the game begins, one player will be assigned the white color, and he will prompted to do the first move; the second player will get the black color, and should wait for the first move of the opponent.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98cb3e69b997ef6097d20b6edb550a27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "esrb_rating": null}
