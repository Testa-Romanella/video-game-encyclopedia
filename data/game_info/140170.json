Have, unfortunately, been tasked with scanning the Augmented Pawns living in the Interzone Wastes at the fringe of society.</p>Directions:<p>Scan all of the Augs and get into the HQ door before your Oxygen runs out. Talk to Pawns in order to ascertain if they are Augmented or not, <strong>Pawns who are Augmented will act with hostility towards you</strong>. Once you think you've found an Aug, scan them. Be careful when scanning: you gain oxygen for every Augmented scan but you lose twice the amount of oxygen if you scan someone who isn't Augmented.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Move: </strong>WASD</li><li><strong>Run: </strong>Shift + WASD</li><li><strong>Talk:</strong> E</li><li><strong>Scan:</strong> Space</li></ul>Contact:<p><strong>twitter:</strong> @nickhaskell</p><p><strong>email:</strong> haskell.nicholas@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b06f78c837be06a3aeba9b926b899346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Nick Haskell"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
