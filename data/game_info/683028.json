Could that be the reason for Hurricanes center Erik Karlsson's teammates taking the ice and punching the ice? (Jennings)\n\nDL \u2013 I'm sure it could be. I don't think it was purposely. I don't think there was any intention to drink, but the timing wasn't exactly right.\n\nSS \u2013 I personally have received a lot of guys' ice packs. I've rolled one of my own. I've actually gagged one of them. An older guy sent me a TON of the stuff and asked if they would ice it after games. I told him no. He's like you want the whole bag? Six packs, and then I get cold. I did see him do that\u2026 about a week ago. Still, he's got it all lined up. He's not drinking. I'm not like throwing it at him like, \"I have a bunch of NHL players in here trying to figure out how to drink these ice packs.\"\n\nDucks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:52:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e43/e43f9dcc4d624ac9ae513bc84e7516db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
