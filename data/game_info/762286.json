Distract her to keep her focus (The bar on the left) low so she doesn't study and get a good grade. You won't be able to keep her focus at zero though, at some point she will inevitably study. Books help her focus while games distract her.</p><p>For those who aren't familiar with the American grading system:</p><p>You have letters from A to D and then F with A being best and F being worst. \u00a0A to D can be followed by a \"+\" or a \"-\" to indicate that it is a relatively good or bad grade. F is just F. If you get an F in school, my condolences. If you get an F here, you mastered the game!<br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our first Ludum Dare submission.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW to move or</p>\n<p>A and D to move<br/></p>\n<p>SPACE to start a new round<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T14:30:00", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
