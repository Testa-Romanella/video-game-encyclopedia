During the game the difficulty will increase, and the lizards will attack you more frequently! If your life will go under zero, you will be confused for some seconds, leaving the core undefended, so try to stay alive!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every asset used for this game has been downloaded from epic store,.</p>\n<p>Every sound was created by me, except for the soundtrack.</p>\n<p>Works on Windows only.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T07:06:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07f/07f2cebd3b23ba07a65428ab9bda7dcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danilo Ferrara"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
