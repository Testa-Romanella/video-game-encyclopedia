A Human eating monster is left lurking through your laboratory and it is your job to escape a free yourself or be eaten by a horrific monster!</p>\n<p>This game was made by a group of four as our senior thesis project. The team included two programmers and two artists that contributed to the idea, development, and design of this game.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>In this game you, the player, are trapped in a laboratory surrounded by darkness. The poorly maintained facility has deteriorated over the years leaving all the electrical light switches unstable. Each light switch is controlled for a light, however, that light switch is not guaranteed to turn the light on in your current room. The more lights that are on the in the laboratory gives a higher chance to blow the fuse which will require you to navigate to the basement to the fuse box. When at the fuse box you will be able to fix it to then be able to use the light switches once again. In order to escape the laboratory you are two search for the generators to power the elevator, which is your only way out alive! While searching for these generators you may encounter the human eating monster that has been lurking. It is very vicious and hungry, but only lives in the darkness.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Movement - 'Left &amp; Right' arrows\u00a0to move in a specific direction</li><li>Flashlight - The direction of the flashlight is controlled by the mouse position</li><li>Interaction Key - Press 'E' to interact with light switches, staircases, fuse boxes, generators &amp; elevator.</li><li>Full View - Press &amp; Hold the 'Space bar' to view all the rooms in the level.</li><li>To Activate Generator - Hold 'Tab' to spin the wheel to active the generator.
