Erik is a young aspiring fiddle player who wants to impress the whole town with his musical talent. There's only one problem. He doesn't have any. Faced with the prospect of embarrassing himself at the festival, Erik sets out on a journey to improve his fiddle playing skills, which may cost him his life or the lives of his family.</p>\n<p>This game is based on the stories of a mythological creature called the Nacken. According to legends, this creature lived in the river, would grab unsuspecting people, and drown them. It would also take on the form of different creatures such as a man with a fiddle or a white horse. In these different shapes, the Nacken would lure victims into the river with a melodious tune or tempt them to take a ride then drown them. There were certain ways to fend off the monster, but we'll let you play the game to find out how.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Art and UI : SealCat https://sealcat.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Programmer : Flavedo https://flavedogame.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Programmer : Ralph Y.
