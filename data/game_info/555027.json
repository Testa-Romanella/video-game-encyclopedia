Looking for a change of sights, three friends, a Miner, a Native and\u00a0a Cowboy, embark on a journey to find an escape from this land. They find an abandoned spaceship, which is missing some components. Determined to take this chance, they split and search for the missing materials.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>This game</strong>\u00a0<strong>was\u00a0</strong></strong>developed\u00a0for the final project\u00a0of my Game Development course as a collaboration of 4 different subjects (curricular units). In it's native form, it includes communication with a website and app (HTML, CSS, JS, NODE JS, CORDOVA, IONIC)\u00a0through a server made in JS. The map was modelled in Blender.\r\n</p>\n<p>NOTE:\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the Multiplayer version! The single player mode is updated to work with the new game mode, so it should be disregarded (check single player version of this project instead). Each pawn can now pick how many items it wants, but now the only goal is to be the first to pick 2 items. There's a vs AI mode with Minimax implementation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:53:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa8/fa8c010d3690e3fdaf8f36fb6d85b261.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WiredDrummer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
