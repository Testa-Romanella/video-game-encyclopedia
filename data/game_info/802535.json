As the result of this attitude, we would like to present you a simple text RPG game about soldier life in the red army. <br/><br/>The game does not aim to alleviate the violence and suffering of people affected by the war, but, on the contrary, to ridicule those who unnecessarily prolong its duration.<br/><br/>So do not hesitate to try to survive 30 days in red army against tough enemy resistance and  all odds caused by incompetence of the red army.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T08:44:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17b/17bb9787add68486039aae53b5745129.jpg", "website": "https://eny-project.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eny Project"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Eny Project"], "esrb_rating": null}
