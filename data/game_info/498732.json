(She exists for a far greater purpose)</p>\r\nGoal\r\n<p>Get to the summit of the mountain.\u00a0</p>\r\nHow To Progress\r\n<p>Follow the minimap.</p>\n<p>Along the way you'll have to open up paths by finding pedestals (marked yellow) in the caves and standing on them\u00a0(they look like an upside down T made of boulders. they are usually isolated and the only thing around). The pedestals cause cave ins that open up new routes around the mountain.\u00a0Play with sound to insure you know when it happens. (Screen shake happens aswell)</p>\n<p>Getting out of the mountain won't always mean going up.</p>\r\nInput (Keyboard)\r\n<p>WASD: Move</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p>Shift: Air Dash</p>\r\nInput (Controller)\r\n<p>LStick: Move</p>\n<p>Facebutton Down: Jump</p>\n<p>LB: Air\u00a0Dash</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Huge Shoutout to\u00a0https://twitter.com/LucindaGrey_for doing the original concept art for Moth which I'm using as the background image and icon. The art predates the jam this prototype was entered into.</p>\n<p>I handled all the game related stuff. Designing, programming, even the character pixel art.\u00a0All done within the time frame of the jam.</p>\r\nAssets Used:\r\n<p>TileSet:\u00a0https://trixelized.itch.io/starstring-fields</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/fantasyrpg-music-pack/</p>\n<p>SFX:\u00a0https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/retro-platformer-sfx-pack-2578/</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/casual-footsteps-sounds/</p>\n<p>Input\u00a0Icons:\u00a0https://1up-indie2.itch.io/pixel-art-input-icons</p>\n<p><strong>Engine:</strong> Custom Build of\u00a0Godot 3.2.3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T04:51:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12e92dbc407c61362e35e3974ccf6663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KRONOS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
