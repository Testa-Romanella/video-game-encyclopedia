Featuring hats, giant guns, velociraptors and lots and lots of buff Cubes with butt physics.<br/><br/>Nothing marks a high-quality game like the release of an unofficial knock-off. So we\u2019ve taken everything good about the 2D multiplayer mayhem that is SQUARE HEROES, and made it 3D, and also much worse!! <br/><br/>This was created for fun as part of Perth\u2019s Potluck games event. For more details on the real, and much better quality, original game, check out the Square Heroes website: http://www.squareheroes.com<br/></p>\n\n<p>Programming: Amos Wolfe</p>\n<p>Art: Jess Watson</p>\n<p>Voice Over: Drew Paridaens</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cd/2cd5d5ce2541ca4b3e39259899c6481b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Moss Wolf Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
