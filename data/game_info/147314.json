Player 1 plays the Fire Eel, player 2 plays Air Eel.  Another control is R1, to zoom in and out.<br/></p><p>As said, this game is built to use a gamepad, and must be taught the buttons.  Open the gamepad manager by clicking the black square in top-left of screen.  All currently-attached gamepads are shown.  If you have a gamepad connected to your computer but do not see it, your browser may not support the Gamepad API, or you may need to refresh the page.  You will fin will be a \"Learn\" link to the right of the gamepad name.  After clicking that, follow the prompts, such as \"Press left stick up\", \"Press face up\".</p><p>Note! face buttons are a generic term for the x-y-a-b or triangle-square-circle-x buttons)</p><p>Note! Gamepad API has trouble recognizing d-pad for some unknown reason. Fortunately, EELemental is simple, it doesn't require the d-pad.</p><p>Game begins zoomed-out. Press R1 to zoom in, or again to zoom out.</p><p>Game works well in browser full-screen mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdd/bdd1940a5a06350ef5baca661accecaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheEdgeOfThought"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
