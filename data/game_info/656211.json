{"id": 656211, "slug": "triangler", "name": "Triangler", "name_original": "Triangler", "description": "<p>Hi, allow me to introduce\u00a0\"Triangler\". A bullet-hell game created for Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2. It is the first game I have ever made (6 days ago, when I started doing this jam, I had no prior experience in unity or game dev in general), so I would appreciate any feedback whatsoever, as that could really help me. You can play my game by either downloading it, or playing it directly from browser, but keep in mind that if you play in browser, your highscore wont be saved.\u00a0<br/><br/>Resources:<br/>Background music -\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Particles -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/48-particle-effect-pa...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:30:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d4a249a9636319c486cae3f3f7f0790.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["TomasC0"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
