Being left alone in the world, the 11-year-old player is determined to search for their long-lost grandmother.\u00a0 They gathered every information found in their house, combined the facts, and left to find the indicated spot drawn in their map.\u00a0<br/><br/>In a fast-paced world, this game was created in order to give the player the opportunity to learn from the wisdom of elderly people.
