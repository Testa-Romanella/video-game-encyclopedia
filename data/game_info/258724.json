{"id": 258724, "slug": "helping-frankenstein", "name": "Helping Frankenstein", "name_original": "Helping Frankenstein", "description": "Helping Frankenstein is a point-and-click adventure where you help Dr Frankenstein bring a dead body back to life. You take on the role as Igor, the newly employed assistant, and set out to do your new master's bidding (your last employment ended quite abruptly at the hands of an angry mob with wooden stakes).<br/><br/>The church is not so keen on this \"bring-people-back-to-life-thing\" and will try to stop you with all means necessary. There is also law enforcement and some other people to get in your way, or maybe help you out, as you progress towards your goal. <br/><br/><br/>Developers' comments:<br/>Helping Frankenstein is not a very long game if you compare it to other point-and-click games on App Store. It is suitable for a longer bus ride, a domestic flight or an evening at home. If you like puzzle- and adventure games we are sure you will appreciate Helping Frankenstein.<br/>The game also contains some poor attempts at humour and sometimes even tries to be witty. It actually contains a real \"ba-dum-tss\" moment with sound effects and everything, so be sure to keep the sound on or you might miss it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T02:36:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d80/d809b10b59920f9ca490e94f99f4a74d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Peeking Peacock HB"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Peeking Peacock HB"], "esrb_rating": null}
