Initially inspired by the game Surakarta, the player was supposed to be able to sneak around a complex steampunk townscape and avoid/capture wandering guards, all while working closer to the strange beam of blue light that pierces the night sky. Slayer gamer types, who enjoy lore-driven games and exploration, are the goal/intended audience for this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T11:30:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42b/42b8066a4c997e8e65b1559ee795d5e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gillian M"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
