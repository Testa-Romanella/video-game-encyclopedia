Playing a plant on a grass biome tile will result in a wheat plant, but playing a plant card somewhere else will also create something else. Try to experiment as much as you can!<br/><br/>Playing cards costs \u2728 'faith' \u2728 that you gain from the humans when they periodically pray for you, or when you fulfill their wishes. One may wish for a berry bush and another for a deadly plague \u2620\ufe0f<br/><br/>One of the more important cards is the \u2697\ufe0f 'inspect' \u2697\ufe0f card. This card can be played on items, objects and sometimes just on empty tiles. The inspect card will trigger an invention that will help the humans explore your world further.<br/><br/>The way you shape the land and guide the humans will decide which way the humans will develop. They can go as far as to build a rocket! \ud83d\ude80<br/><br/><strong>The metagame</strong><br/>You can play Simmiland in 2 different modes:<br/><ul><li> Normal mode - your card deck is limited and you will find the apocalypse card at the bottom<br/></li><li> Endless mode - you can play an endless amount of cards, but you won't get any achievements</li></ul><br/>In normal mode you will get achievements. Both achievements and progress will net you some in-game currency which you can use to buy new and more cards to fill your deck, giving opportunity to new possibilities.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> Quick, but relaxing, 10~60 minutes play per game<br/></li><li> An alternative endless mode where you can shape the land into infinity<br/></li><li> ~20 different cards<br/></li><li> 13 different biome types<br/></li><li> 30+ inventions to discover<br/></li><li> 40+ different resources to discover<br/></li><li> 20+ different achievements to fiind</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-23T17:58:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/264/26449e92939381a878f7ead89b012587.jpg", "website": "http://www.sokpop.co", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 179, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 16, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sokpop Collective"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sokpop Collective"], "esrb_rating": null}
