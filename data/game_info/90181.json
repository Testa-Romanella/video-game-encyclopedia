What about leaving passive-aggressive Post-It notes for your flatmates?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Swipe left and right to decide who goes to which afterlife. Careful though -- send souls to the wrong place and heaven and hell will begin to run out of space as management on either side slows down to deal with the incorrect entries. Also, you'll get some pretty rude texts from the custodians on either side.</p>\n<p>Grimder is a Ludum Dare gamejam\u00a0play on dating apps. With the theme \u201crunning out of space\u201d we came up with the idea that Heaven and Hell have a capacity limit which fills up quickly if the wrong people are assigned to each place. You play as Death, swiping left and right to send characters to hell or heaven based on their traits. It was our team's first LD game -- we took it chill and had a lot of fun, putting in about 5 hours per person per day.\u00a0</p><p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/grimder<br/></p>\n<p>This game was super cathartic to make, as most of the things that send people to hell are actually just our own pet peeves.
