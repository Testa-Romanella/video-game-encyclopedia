The goal is to survive for five minutes as hordes of baddies swarm upon thee. This may sound like an impossible task, but you are a Lord of the Edge, or something like that. You have many tools at your disposal: bow and arrows, fireballs, meteors, goo traps, protection spells. Make judicious use of them.<br/></p>\n<p>If you survive, vast treasures await thee. But if you lose... well, at least you died heroically.</p>\n<p>More content is planned. But for now, please enjoy.
