You build your deck from picking 1 of 2 choices of card given to you, and you get to see the opponent's card and select a card from your hand out of 3 to try to beat it.</p>\n<p>Rock paper scissors is a game where playing perfectly randomly will get you a win rate of 50%. Humans cannot play perfectly randomly, and adding deckbuilding adds another layer of strategy for people as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You get 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, and 0 points for a lose in this variant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created in Unity in ~2 hours.</p>\n<p>Attributions:</p>\n<p>Rock - https://game-icons.net/1x1/john-redman/rock.html#download</p>\n<p>Paper - https://game-icons.net/1x1/john-redman/paper.html#download</p>\n<p>Scissors - https://game-icons.net/1x1/john-redman/scissors.html#download</p>\n<p>Background: https://www.windowscentral.com/image-most-popular-windows-wallpaper-ever-was-tak...</p>\n<p>Background Music: https://opengameart.org/content/lofi-hip-hop</p>\n<p>Card Sounds adapted from: https://opengameart.org/content/54-casino-sound-effects-cards-dice-chips</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d92b4ac23c7e90c1c14ae53c4ff54911.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nhahn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
