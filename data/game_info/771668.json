Dropping the balls and the level transition are all I could think of.</p>\n<p>Limitation:\u00a0\u00a0Finite Quantity. The balls are limited.</p>\n<p>It's breakout, but you start the game with 60 balls. Balls that you lose are lost forever. When you complete the stage you carry the surviving balls with you. Get as far as you can.</p>\n<p>Basically took the gamejam as a chance to fiddle with the engine and get comfortable with it. I'm ending the jam with a few usable modular functions, some sprites, a logo splash screen,\u00a0</p><p>Developed in Pico-8. Built entirely in engine without any external tools. Next time I'll probably use VS Code for the code editing, because it gets really annoying when lines get just a little long.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>For funsies, if you enter up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, O, X at the main menu, you'll get 250 balls instead of 60.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T06:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b2/8b2ff8cff7b4294f032b785422e9c209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aloehart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
