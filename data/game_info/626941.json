The technical theme was \"exploration\" and the creative theme was \"forgotten places\"; my personal inspiration for this game was the concept of \"map erasure\" and to offer a memory challenge.</p>\n<p>Note: this is a purely two player local\u00a0game, so grab a nearby friend and enjoy playing against each other!</p>\n<p>All necessary information to play is contained within the game; however, something not explicitly mentioned is my encouragement to \"house rule\" the experience if you find it too random or luck-based. A good starting point might be to allow both players to take shorthand, coded notes on a shared piece of paper; or perhaps grab some extra friends and play as a team game.</p>\n<p>Player Input:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse (left-click) for most play elements\r\n</li><li>F1 while on the main game screen for quick reminder info</li><li>F5 to restart\r\n</li><li>ESC to quit</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Created solo by:\u00a0 \u00a0Pete Vellucci Jr\r\n</li><li>Additional third-party asset acknowledgements can be found within the game</li></ul>\n<p>Technical Note:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>This game was programmed at a default 1920x1080 resolution and coded around the 16:9 aspect ratio.
