Each placed building adds a certain population to your city.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBy placing at least three buildings of the same type horizontally or vertically next to each other, the buildings will be merged and upgraded to fit even more population. You get extra bonus population for merging more than three buildings of the same type. In addition you get a bonus if you trigger a chain reaction of mergers. New buildings for the placement will be randomly generated. But you can see the next three buildings in advance to plan your city layout carefully.<br/>\n<br/>Thanks for playing!<br/>\r\nGood luck and have fun!</p>\n\n<p>If you have some ideas for this game or want to report a bug, please let me know. \r\nYour feedback is highly appreciated!
