Waiting. Watching.<br/>My wife and I had chosen the reflective lettering on the glass of our shop in an attempt to catch the eyes of passerby to peruse our wares.<br/>I do not understand why, but it seems to confuse them.<br/>Almost immediately on turning to the glass the light in their eyes will fade, and they will either stand idly, waiting, or join the ranks of the others.<br/>A sudden scream shatters my thoughts and I slowly stand and walk toward the glass pane.<br/>A lone woman runs screaming through the street.</em>\n<em>\r\nYOU (horrified)<br/>No\u2026No!</em>\n<em>NARRATOR<br/></em><em>As soon as I speak one of the Listless turns toward the window and I press myself against the wall in terror.<br/></em><em>It weaves to and fro in indecisive consternation, its ears aware of sound but the mirrored letters confusing its vision.<br/></em><em>After a few moments it turns back towards the woman.<br/></em><em>By the time I work up enough nerve to return to the glass and try to help, it is too late.<br/></em><em>But the Listless aren\u2019t even the worst part.<br/></em><em>The dust.<br/></em><em>The dust is\u00a0<em><strong>always</strong></em>\u00a0worse.</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T05:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60c/60c63ddbe50ca6893206bee55d104dbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Corvaena"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
