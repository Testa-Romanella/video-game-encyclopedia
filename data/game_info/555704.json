He was trained in Rome and came to America to help the cities of sin and decadence restore their faith in God. One day his job takes him to an abandoned Church, nevertheless, he must press on and complete his duty, which is restoring Faith in God wherever he roams.</p>\n\n<p>Entered into the 'Narrative Driven Jam #1' --\u00a0Narrative Driven Jam #1 - itch.io</p>\n\n<p>This game will focus heavily on spiritual themes and supernatural\u00a0aspects. Some puzzles are present as elements of progress\u00a0but this will be narrative driven primarily. I wish I had more time to work on this to expand the puzzle section but either way this was a lot of fun to work on. I hope you guys found what you were looking for haha.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e8/6e8247e826d869a57c8f15e30e97f59a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NerdimationStudio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
