The game is named after a sacred stone frog idol that is the centerpiece of the game's story. The objective of Zuma is to eliminate a chain of colored balls before they reach the end of a path. The player controls a frog-shaped shooter that can rotate 360 degrees and fire colored balls to create matches of three or more.</p>\n<p>The gameplay mechanics of Zuma are relatively simple but require quick thinking and strategy to master. The game starts with a few balls moving along a path towards a central point. The player must aim and shoot balls of matching colors to create chains of three or more. When a chain is created, the balls are eliminated, and the chain shrinks. If the chain reaches the central point, the player loses a life.</p>\n<p>As the game progresses, the speed of the balls increases, and new colors are added to the chain, making it more challenging to create matches. The game features several power-ups that can help the player, such as bombs that destroy a group of balls or a laser that can eliminate a single ball. The game is divided into levels, and each level presents a unique challenge that must be overcome to progress to the next level.</p>\n<p>Zuma's colorful graphics and addictive gameplay have made it a hit with casual gamers worldwide. The game is available on multiple platforms, including PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and mobile devices, and has spawned several sequels and spin-offs. Zuma is an excellent game for players of all ages and skill levels, offering hours of challenging, entertaining gameplay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T07:55:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6d/d6d65eb305aed6a6be1215af3e1bc094.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sanmaniro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
