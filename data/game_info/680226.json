Have you got what it takes to escape?</p>\n<p>As short point and click  game with horror elements and some hopefully interesting puzzles. It was thought up after playing \"Escape Lala\" last year, which had a very nice puzzle that inspired the game's basic concept. Escape from Dimansion features the voice talents of Troels \u201cSpace Quest Historian\u201d Pleimert as the protagonist, the wonderful Ivy Dupler as his lovely wife Linda,  the versatile Vincent van Omen as Mephistopheles and Dr. Lucas, and the rumbling voice of Adrian Vaughan which gives me the chills. Thank you so much for giving life to my sub-par prose!</p>\n<p>If you have trouble progressing through the game, I have put up a hint page on my website.</p>\n<p>Have fun and please comment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T03:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30a/30a6930ab30d01fceaee4bec8ca2c66d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steven Don"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
