Dodge, block, or shoot them. Whatever you do, survive. Don\u2019t get hit in the head or it\u2019s game over. Use your amazing reflexes to dodge out of the way of an onslaught of bullets. Use your shields to block bullets that get too close. And use your gun to shoot incoming projectiles out of the sky and impress your friends. <br/>\r\nThings getting out of hand? Use your slow time ability to get the edge. But be careful. The flow of time is a constant that should not be meddled with. When your slow time ability stops, the world will move faster to get back to where it should be.<br/>\r\nEach level requires only that you survive, but mere survival won\u2019t get you to the top of the leaderboard. For that, you\u2019ll need to be fast, quick, and accurate. Maybe get creative and find the hidden bonus levels too.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b301842abb64a6406d980385295b04e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QRA-CS"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["QRA-CS"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
