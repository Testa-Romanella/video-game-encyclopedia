Vote on one of the four available stages and get ready to brawl!</p>\n<p>Combat in Brawlygons is all about bouncing your opponents out of bounds. Knock them into the bounds of the white box, and they're out. Push other players around by moving into them while twisting and turning to gain the advantage. Get a short burst of acceleration by dashing, but time your dashes well, or you'll be left vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Matches only go until one player has won twice, so you frequently get the chance to switch up your shape.</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls<br/></strong>Brawlygons is best played with controllers, but if you do not have enough controllers, up to four players can play on the keyboard.</p>\n<p>There are button-prompts within the game that refer to the buttons on the controllers. Simply substitute the prompts for their equivalents on the keyboard.</p>\n<ol><li>Left stick = WASD, A/R = E, B/L = Q, X = X</li><li>Left stick = arrow keys, A/R = enter, B/L = right shift, X = right ctrl</li><li>Left stick = IJKL, A/R = O, B/L = U, X = M</li><li>Left stick = numpad 8456, A/R = numpad 9, B/L = numpad 7, X = numpad 0 (make sure num lock is on)</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d2/0d2897d5290c820b46bc19cd494a183a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathan Powless-Lynes"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
