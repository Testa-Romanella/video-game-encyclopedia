Over the semester I have developed this game from a completely blank unity project, to a tech demo just to fit all the required mechanics for a deadline, to a semi complete-ish game that is actually playable, if only for a few moments. The game features a combat system that features disc throwing, enemy's dying, and the player dying; a movement system, damage zones,\u00a0 health collectibles, an unfinished pause system, and some level of exploration. when I have time I will probably continue this game outside of school, but for now know it is just a very early iteration (and has some stuff just to appease my insane teachers [eg. fountain pools as the projectiles]).\u00a0 Controls are: wasd\u00a0/<strong>\u2191\u2193\u2192\u2190</strong> = movement, right click = attack, esc = pause.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to RafaelMatos for the assets</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T04:02:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a691a68bd83f5be03d6f65f6200985ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SparkAcademy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
