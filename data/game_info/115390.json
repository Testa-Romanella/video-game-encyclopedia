Thanks to a new law passed you both have the right to defend your personal space, use that right wisely. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tEither attempt to make your way around the malicious player without invading his space, or attempt to get him to enter yours.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCheck out this gif of gameplay!\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game isn't even \"Early Access\", in fact I'd say it's pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha.
