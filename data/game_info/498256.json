It throws players into the middle (beginning?) of a young astronaut's life and explores the moment they decided the stars were their destiny. I spent a lot of time thinking about the story's direction and, as a result, I made numerous adjustments throughout the week. I funneled everything I <em>wanted </em>players to experience into several key moments with an emphasis on the final one. What I ended up with was a short experience that builds up to a momentous finale: one that might be the most grandiose a human could possibly have.</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T03:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48f/48f231a920f0e1cfa5340d082815f03d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
