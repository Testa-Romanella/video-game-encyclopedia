However,\u00a0 this mission took place\u00a0during a time where scientists had not yet figured out how to deorbit a space capsule, thus her survival was never expected in the first place.</p>\n<p>Laika was only given 7 days of oxygen supply. She was meant to die from oxygen depletion - a quick, painless death, within a week of her launch.\u00a0However, there was a malfunction with the heater inside the capsule, and Laika died within hours from overheating. According to records, she died all alone and in fear.</p>\n<p>In this alternative universe, you get the chance to comfort Laika and make sure she dies in peace.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:21:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4ad37b4b6be657182d1c929b91b36fb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gnocchii"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
