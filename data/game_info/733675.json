Particles and  feedback are not polished but the main goal  was to make<em> everything work together</em>. \r\n</p>\r\nTime limit\r\n<p>\r\nWith the spare time i had for development  i just wanted to go through the full cycle of developing a game.\r\n</p>\r\nP.S.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a post-release goal i plan to <strong>refactor the code</strong>. Because of the time limit of the jam i didn`t put enough effort writing  a clean reusable code. So follow this project on GitHub to see  refactoring results in near future.<br/><br/>Currently there is some visual bugs\u00a0in web version. Cleaning it right now<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e71/e71d73133a2e9dd553d71524b4a97caa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iDeen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
