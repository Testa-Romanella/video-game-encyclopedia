Players also have the ability to jump. The main objective of the game is to score as many points as possible in a two minute span. Collecting coins are 1 point. Colliding with the wall is -1 point. And colliding with the enemy ball player has two results, higher altitude (greater transform.position.y) gains 3 points and lower altitude (lower transform.position.y) loses 2 points. Platforms are there to be used to gain advantages in the fights in mid-air. The player with the highest amount of points wins when the time reaches zero. But be careful because no matter how many points you have accumulated, if your ball player falls off the map you will automatically lose. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/430e560721845854ba6ff3e5ddf214d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AirWoo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
