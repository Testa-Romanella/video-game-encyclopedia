Basically it is Pong with little extras. You can play the classic version with fixed positions or the half- or full-roam version.</p>\n<p>The controls for the red player is WASD und for the blue player the arrow keys. So you can play with a friend on one screen and also play against an AI or let the AI compete to each other.</p>\n<p>The ball will be faster with every player hit. The player who scores 7 points first wins the game. Restart the game at any time with the \"R\" key.</p>\n<p>So let the old times revive! Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da51256e8e6e7ef92eeb9abc4233dcd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CleverAI"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
