Immo-1 only targets thrusters.<br/></p>\n<p>While a unit is selected, various stats about them are displayed on the top left.<br/></p>\n<p>In \u00c6geon, societies live in floating platforms. There is only a handful of different elements that comprise the universe.<br/><br/>Red \u00c6ther is the densest element. It's used to construct heavy and sturdy materials like buildings, and hulls of ships. To harvest it you have to go deep down where it can be precarious to mine and haul.<br/><br/>Orange \u00c6ther is mostly a liquid element. It fills the entire \"world\". It can be refined into efficient fuels.</p>\n<p>Yellow \u00c6ther is an even lighter dynamic element. It collects into clouds high above. It can be collected to energize various electronics.</p>\n<p>There is green, blue, indigo, and violet \u00c6ther. But they work on a more interpersonal level, and aren't as relevant in this RTS game.</p>\n<p>I mostly created this prototype to test how difficult it would be, to put standard RTS controls into a browser game. Luckily it was surprisingly easy to implement things like control groups, and shift-clicking commands.<br/><br/><em>Control groups are a way of grouping a number of units together, to be re-selected easily.<br/>A common way to do so it to assign numbers 0-9 on the keyboard to different groups.<br/>Pressing ctrl+number sets the currently selected units into that number group.<br/>Then the group can be quickly re-selected by just pressing the number by itself.<br/><br/>Shift clicking is a common way to queue commands to a unit/units.<br/>While holding shift, if you right click various points, the unit will navigate to each point<br/>in succession.<br/><br/></em>I also want to share in the devlog various thoughts I have on potential RTS.<br/>I invite you to join me in the discussion of the various possibilities this genre could explore!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T11:22:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b93/b9309d8f03beb0a0498c8527c4c6ffdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sxtycat"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
