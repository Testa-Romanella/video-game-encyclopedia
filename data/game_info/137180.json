(GMTK Game Jam)", "description": "<p>TASSG is a fast paced, tactical\u00a0orbiting arcade\u00a0shooter\u00a0in which you fly a small Ship trying to take out enemy Bases one at a time by hitting their Weak Spots, while at the same time maneuvering to evade their shots.</p>\n<p>It was made in ~16 hours of work while spending a weekend at the beach with my family. I'd say at least 30% of the game was made while on a ship and the other 70% pretty late at night =D<br/></p>\n<p>It has been made for the Game Maker's ToolKit Game Jam,<br/>with the Theme being: Dual Purpose Design.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A / D / Left Arrow / Right Arrow - Turning</p>\n<p>W / Up Arrow / Space - Boost &amp; Fire</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics &amp; Theme:</strong></p>\n<p>- Boosting your ship also fires your weapon;</p>\n<p>- Your Ship's Boost Charge acts as a 1-hit shield against other bullets (getting depleted in the process);<br/></p>\n<p>- Shooting the Bases' Weak Spots damages the Base and gives the player an extra 3 Boost Charge.<br/></p>\n<p>- Destroying a Base replenishes the player's Boost Charge.<br/></p>\n<p>- If the player gets hit and the Boost Charge is 0, the player's Ship is destroyed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Andrei Tache - Game Design, Programming and Rudimentary Art</p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made with\u00a0Construct 2\u00a0Personal Edition;</p>\n<p>-Art made with Paint.Net.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback :)</strong></p>\n<p>I'd love to hear what you thought about the game, so be sure to let me know!</p>\n<p>I was quite surprised with how this small project turned out, and I am thinking about turning it into a bigger project with more enemy variety, randomly generated levels and maybe even boss fights.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f12/f12c9364213448d676e3892f4c1a9040.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Moon Light Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
