Humanity has started to develop truely intelligent automata, and the latest innovations are coming out of The Orion Project.</p>\n<p>All automata must follow the three laws of robotics, and you have been tasked\u00a0with assessing if the Orion automata are\u00a0capable of serving and protecting a human owner.</p>\n<p>The one problem is - they aren't able to understand human speech. The Council of Robot Enquiry (Known to most as CORE) outlawed automata from being able to speak with humans in the year 2025, as to prevent personal attachment, so instructions are issued to robots via standardised control panels.</p>\n<p>Will you find that The Orion are worthy of integration into humanity? Or is artificial intelligence only a flash in the pan for our civilisation? That is for you to decide. --</p>\n<p>--Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Spacebar to Jump</p>\n<p>E to interact with control panels and exit doors</p>\n<p>Esc to go back to the main menu.</p>\n<p>--Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy my Wowie 4.0 Entry!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T23:30:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d0/3d0333c208249a7110863488c51dd19b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spunky2"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
