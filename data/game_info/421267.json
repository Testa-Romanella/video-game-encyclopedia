So i gave him the tool clicteam fusion 2.5 to play with.\u00a0 Now\u00a0 a\u00a0 year later he has made about 50 diffrent games all very fun and creative.<br/>Having been sorting thru his libaries of games i found a game called \"MONSTERS and DANGERS\" that really took to me beacuse it seemed complete. Bear in mind my brother still struggles with his spelling and the game is centerd around text so use your childlike mind to fill in the blanks and i hope that you will enjoy it just as much as i did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is about a group of goblins that capture a child (you the player) and send him on diffrent odd jobs.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T03:09:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/885/8855930967da143b6cd35c1f410d9dae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MadPixelGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
