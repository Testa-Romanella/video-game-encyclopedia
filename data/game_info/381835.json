An evil sorceress, the Temptris, sends random dungeon rooms hurtling your way, and it is up to you to rotate and move them so that they make up a dungeon. You must ensure that there are paths to every enemy, because you cannot kill the Temptris without killing them first. Once your dungeon has reached all the way to the Temptris, you have a limited amount of time to traverse it and make it to her - hope you did a good job building the dungeon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T07:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d0097c4b9f42c9e5507367e473dd8e36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axelancer"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
