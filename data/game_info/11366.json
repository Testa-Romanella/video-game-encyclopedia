It is literally made using the Unity game engine.  AGFPRO is a real-time, RAPID Game Environment Development Toolkit and is made to be used in concert with Unity Free and Pro for level/map creation. \u2013 However, AGFPRO does NOT need Unity to run or create levels/maps.<br/><br/></li><li>The scene files that users create in AGFPRO \u201cBasic\u201d and \u201cPremium\u201d can be imported into Unity4 Free and Pro using our AGF/Unity tools.<br/><br/></li><li>By using the DLC we have already released for AGFPRO (Fantasy Side-Scroller,  Zombie FPS, Drone Kombat, BattleMat Multiplayer &amp;amp; Voxel Sculp), users are able to create playable levels with AGFPRO (only \u2013 not viable with Unity) with a variety of characters, assets, gameplay mechanics and special feature, \u201cScene-Linking\u201d to connect game levels<br/><br/></li><li>There are limitations to some asset packs \u201clocked (L)\u201d that limit the users from loading these assets into Unity.  All unlocked asset packs are free of copyright and can be used via Unity for redistribution per the terms of the EULA http://ttp://media.wix.com/ugd/43457c_ee338ac5b4f644eb8b432518a8bb3d79.pdf<br/><br/></li><li>The redistribution or \u201csharing\u201d of the games users are able to make using AGF and DLC \u201cPlayers\u201d is a feature we are working on at this time and will be made available to users at no additional fee<br/><br/></li><li>Users are also able to create and place specific game play mechanics that are provided in the software<br/><br/></li><li>Full customization of your levels and maps is possible with AGFPRO Premium and Unity Pro, whereby users are able to bring in their own assets and models to make their games unique and further commercialize, making a complete Stand-Alone game</li></ul><strong>Additional Questions RE: AGFPRO?</strong><ul><li>If you are interested in making a complete Stand-Alone game with unique characters, models, assets and game play mechanics not provided in AGFPRO and  commercialize it for sale, you will need AGFPRO Premium and either Unity Free or Pro software<br/><br/></li><li>If you are a development team using AGFPRO + Premium, you will need one seat per team member using the software, but we do offer studio discounts, so be sure to contact us for special pricing<br/><br/></li><li>We have many schools all over the globe using AGFPRO to teach game development and design in the classroom, from middle schools to elite Colleges and Universities.  We have a basic curriculum available that instructors are able to include in their course curriculum and we provide additional support that includes software updates, access to DLC, non-Steam versions of the software if necessary, user support and special feature integration upon request and based on the terms of the agreement.  We offer special pricing for schools and we find that schools love using the software as it allows students the ability to create complete games within the limitation of a semester and is a great introduction to begin to interface with Unity3d, without users having to program, model, animate or script.
