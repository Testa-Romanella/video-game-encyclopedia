You&#39;ve never had so much coming at you so fast in so many colors. Named the &quot;Best of Show&quot; at CES, you&#39;ll explore 100 enemy-packed galaxies, experience outrageous Melt-O-Vision graphics and powerful 3D polygons, and be driven to a frenzy by an original techno-rave score. There&#39;s even an optional two-player mode. Don&#39;t forget, Tempest 2000 can only be played on the powerful Jaguar 64-Bit system by Atari. With all this action, no other system could handle it. Yes, you have a chance to survive. Yes, it&#39;s a slim one.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Flippers. Don&#39;t let the innocent name fool you. Once they flip onto you, they&#39;ll suck you down pronto.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pulsars. The electric eels of the cosmos. They electrify corridors. If you&#39;re on the corridor, you fry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fuseballs. The scumballs of the universe. If a Fuseball touches your blaster, you&#39;re history.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Demon Heads. Intergalactic bad-asses. When you shoot one, its horns live on. Nasty little trick.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UFOs. Now you&#39;re surrounded. UFOs fly above the web and you&#39;ve got to get above them. Good luck.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Warp Bonus Round. Too weird to describe. Just get there and zone out for some serious points.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-16T20:20:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aef/aefe27d18546bc44d0aeee0cd9236b72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation", "Classic Macintosh", "SEGA Saturn", "Jaguar"], "developers": ["High Voltage Software", "Atari", "Imagitec Design", "Llamasoft", "Atari Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Atari", "Interplay Productions", "Logicware"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
