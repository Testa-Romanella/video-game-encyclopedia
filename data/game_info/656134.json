Ritz's goal is to sew as much chaos as possible within the different social circles at school. Raise your reputation to take over the group as you hold more and more power over the students on campus. Enjoy using shady methods such as blackmail, instigation, and rumors to sever bonds between friends (or you could be lame and win them over with friendship, gifts, and kindness, but who'd want to do that).</p>\n<p>Use these methods to become the ultimate raccoon student!</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Director/Composer - Ruby Raccoon<br/>Programmer - William Jeon<br/>Artists: - OnixSaga<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Thomas Montondo<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- ZorroStep</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f2/1f210d316a9cd6e4413872a3f9c32967.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheWillgamer"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
