It's a glitchy mess of a platformer with barely functioning controls. It's the catalyst for headaches in those who stare at it too long. It's a very short game made by an absolute beginner who's never made a game before. More than all these things, however,\u00a0<em>\"NOTHING</em>\" is a walk through my mind. The glitches represent my failing psyche. The jumps that hardly register represent my ill health. The word \"NOTHING\" being repeated represe- oh to hell with it. It's glitchy because it's my first game, but maybe it'll provide you a few minutes of entertainment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 45, my first game jam, in about 20 hours. Should have been 72 hours, but\u00a0 I kept scrapping my ideas and starting again. In the end, as simple and silly as this game might be, I actually quite like it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>LUDUM DARE 45</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>THEME: START WITH NOTHING</strong></p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME IN FULLSCREEN, ELEMENTS MAY BE CUT OFF IF YOU DON'T.
