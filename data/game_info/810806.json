Smash them into the floor to burst them like pi\u00f1atas of blood and entrails. When you run out of bullets, throw your gun in the enemy's face.</p>\n<p>The blood and destruction isn't there because of shock value, or for some profound message about how violence affects people.

Shivs, silenced chainsaws, shotguns and rocket launchers all are at your disposal... letting you dispose of enemies with style!</p>\n<p>Of course, you're gonna need all the firepower you can get as you dive deeper and deeper into both proverbial and literal bullet hell...<br/></p>\n\r\nNuclear Options\r\n<p>Features tons of grating effects that will make your eyes bleed! Enter a trance of flashing lights, chromatic abherration, and VHS artefacts as the techno beat keeps your heart pumping at 220 BPM.</p>\n<p>The effects can be turned off in the options menu if you can't take it anymore, some of them can even be turned up to higher settings than the defaults if you feel like you need even more punishment.</p>\n\r\nNote: Jam Entry\r\n<p>This game is an entry to a month-long jam. Turns out, a month wasn't enough to finish it, so right now it's a demo version which only has three stages.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T07:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc968b699c4c45d2afbdc20e1799c56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 339, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
