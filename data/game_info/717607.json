I joined GDU online to help me along the way. Ive been working on this game here and there so I made a bet with myself that I would publish this game before the end of the year. With 1 hour to spare... here it is. Help I'm LOST in the woods! In the game just explore the beautiful environment I created. I know I have a lot to improve on but If anyone can give me constrictive criticism that will be great. I'm looking to learn! Do not hold back.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T04:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b7584e533bdd7e849fa68b6674c12b02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eugene1321"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
