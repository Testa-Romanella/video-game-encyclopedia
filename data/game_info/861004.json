The theme was \"space\".<br/><br/>Those familiar with Pocket Platformer\u00a0may notice that L&amp;BGR makes use of a few modifications that aren't included in the game-making tool itself (yet). These mods are experimental and while seemingly robust MAY result in bugs due to experimental hacking of the output HTML file by someone with next to no\u00a0knowledge of\u00a0the scripting language it's even in. I think it might be Javascript? Anyway\u00a0if you spot any problems, please report them in the comments below so that they can be addressed as soon as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T20:31:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d7/0d797867fd41a13561ac7f0c5c3aed6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AK"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
