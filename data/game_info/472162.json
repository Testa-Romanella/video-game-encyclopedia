It's about a simple, relatively straightforward day of work in a world that's anything but simple or straightforward. Sorry for the file size; there's about an hour of music in there, give or take.<br/></p>\n<p>I made this to get used to the Godot engine, mostly, but you can still have a good 10-15 minutes with this. Play with mouse and keyboard (mostly the arrow keys). Avoid spikes, ride moving platforms, collect coins. Orbs act as save points. You'll get the hang of it, I'm sure. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>(If you can't get past level 3, remember what the game told you to do if you get stuck.)<br/></p>\n<p>\r\nHere's a list of the <strong>assets</strong> I used.
