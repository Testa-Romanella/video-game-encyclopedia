Do not fall into the fishing nets and dodge the flying harpoons in you! And do not try to swallow an underwater mine, it will also kill you! Having reached the second level of evolution, your shark will receive an additional life. And by evolving to the third level you will get the ability to gobble up the harpoon and even get points for it! (just press the spacebar to do this). Unobtrusive gameplay under pleasant music.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/219/219e3ad87e455e131a513e9ff95d41bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 31}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Trinity gaming"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Freshtrax"], "esrb_rating": null}
