{"id": 553928, "slug": "neurohead", "name": "NeuroHead", "name_original": "NeuroHead", "description": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<p><strong>NeuroHead\u00a0</strong>is a<strong>\u00a02D Pixel-Art\u00a0</strong><strong>Side-Scrolling Action Game\u00a0</strong>(say that three times fast in a row), set in a\u00a0<strong>n</strong><strong>ot all too far dystopian future</strong>, where you will\u00a0infiltrate heavily guarded corporations,\u00a0trying to end the manipulative games of a secretive order of\u00a0wealthy and powerful tycoons,\u00a0for which the rest of society bears the brunt.\u00a0There is an emphasis on\u00a0<strong>parkour</strong>,\u00a0<strong>hacking\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>stealth</strong>, but the game will include\u00a0<strong>combat\u00a0</strong>as well.\u00a0It will be\u00a0up to you, on how to approach\u00a0the varied\u00a0securities and dangers, posed in each\u00a0level.</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<strong>NeuroHead</strong>, you will play as\u00a0<strong>Willow</strong>, a young hacker and\u00a0parkour runner,\u00a0 who works under the guise of a shadowy counter organization. Willow has her own reasons for entering the fray, but her and your choices will ripple across the grid of entire nations, altering the way we know life, forever.</p>\n<p>Development is currently in its<strong>\u00a0early stages</strong>.</p>\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>We are a team of two out of College Developers, based in Switzerland.\u00a0<strong>NeuroHead\u00a0</strong>is something we are currently working on in our spare time, since as of now, it is not sustainable (Sadface). But we are\u00a0fueled by our passion to make a\u00a0<strong>dark\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>visceral 2D game.</strong>\u00a0We want\u00a0<strong>NeuroHead to be that game, which provides</strong>\u00a0as much\u00a0<strong>player freedom</strong>\u00a0as possible within the confines of our scope, while also being an\u00a0<strong>immersive ride</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>NeuroHead</strong>'s<strong>\u00a0Level\u00a0</strong><strong>Design</strong>\u00a0is inspired by the\u00a0<strong>holistic Design</strong>\u00a0of the DISHONORED and HITMAN franchises, where the player starts off in one section of the level with objectives they need to locate, reach and complete, but without easily giving away the where and how.</p>\n<p><strong>Hacking</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Stealth\u00a0</strong>are two vital parts to the gameplay, which we have not touched upon yet. We want everything, which seems like it could be hacked, able to be hacked! There are many paths within the level you can take, but also those you can create.\u00a0We want the combat to be harsh and deadly, if the player chooses not to plan ahead, 2+\u00a0enemies should be able to murder you with relative ease.\u00a0 In order to overcome the challenges, we want you to connect the dots how you see fit, in ways we could never even imagine!</p>\n<p>Currently, we are\u00a0<strong>focusing\u00a0</strong>a lot of our work on\u00a0<strong>Willow</strong>, the main character. We want the movement and feedback to feel fluid and responsive, which will be an ongoing endeavor. Next up, we will be tinkering\u00a0around with level design sections and basic AI and environment interactions, such as security cameras and turrets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the\u00a0<strong>Alpha 0.1</strong>, we are fully honing in on Willow, the main protagonist and player character.\u00a0We have put our time into\u00a0<strong>movement, camera navigation</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>visual appearances</strong>, with\u00a0<strong>base feedback</strong>\u00a0in place.\u00a0Many of the features here are still rough, but should help get a sense of what we are going for!</p>\n<p>As of right now we have a\u00a0<strong>sand box</strong>\u00a0to test\u00a0<strong>Willow</strong>'s base movement. We did implement a small\u00a0<strong>mini game</strong>\u00a0(accessible through the pause menu)\u00a0with an obtainable objective, for the player to be able to have something to work towards to, and encourage learning the\u00a0movement. The level design and\u00a0art is mostly temporarily, but does highlight certain approaches, that we want to pursue down the line.\u00a0The current build is still a bit wonky and has some weird behaviors, which will need ongoing fixing. As of right now,\u00a0<strong>NeuroHead\u00a0</strong>is only playable with Mouse and Keyboard, with potential controller support down the line.</p>\n<p>Please let us know, based on testing the features in the\u00a0<strong>NeuroHead\u00a0</strong>Alpha, how they make you feel,\u00a0as we look to keep improving and developing the experience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee you in the Flow Zone kid... err\u00a0madam/sir,\r\n\r\nOsmorpheus &amp;\u00a0JonyT", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d45922e5bedd5d8e666468e6b4b128b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Osmorpheus", "JonyT"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
