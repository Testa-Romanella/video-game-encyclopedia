Originally, we had an idea where everyone would be randomly thrown into multiple sides of a scenario and depending on the overall results would open up a new scenario. An example would be the decision to be a group that hunts or harvests. If a majority of people chose \"hunt\", after a certain time (we were thinking a few hours) the next scenario would be of the group deciding to either be nomadic or territorial. For the \"harvest\" scenario we would have the group want to settle and build a village and you\u00a0 would have to choose if you wanted to live in the mountains, near the ocean, or in the woods. From here, more scenarios would be played out until we get to some end state. The aspect of \"Only One\" was that you have a choice to affect the group but in the end there is only one choice that really wins out.\u00a0Afterwards the entire game world would reset and another session would play out, possibly differently, and you can see what choices people tended to go towards in a sort of global leaderboard/results screen.</p><p>That was the plan anyways lol.</p><p>What this game ended up being, due to time constraints (read as life) and experience it ending being what it is now.</p><p><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>One Choice</li><li>One Main Character</li><li>Player choice statistics</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a35/a3523f7ab931e8657e4c82ab21be1e56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["penguindustin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
