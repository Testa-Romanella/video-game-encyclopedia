The group is composed of one Game Designer (Julia Emmink), two Developers (Bob Jeltes &amp; Niels Vriezen), two 3D Artists (Kyra van den Dries &amp; Zo\u00eb van Dijke) and one Tech Artist (Jeffrey Saydam). They have worked together for 5 months to make the game \u201cMonster Munch\u201d in cooperation with the Imagine Film Festival and Auris Media.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cFor this game we really tried to capture the fun in horror and wondered how it would be to be in the shoes, or rather flippers of the monster. This was really our starting point and from here we looked at the classic monster movies and comics for the art style. Since they often have fun bold lines, bold shadows and a good suspense. We all hope you enjoy the game and in doing so, experience a bit of the film festival from home.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>-The Barbeanians</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T05:02:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/5260b0d0416a9a3a92987b47eff3f898.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Imagine Filmfestival"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
