Without seeking to comprehend the mysteries of the universe or explore the world beyond the heavens, the Wok lived in peace and harmony with nature and themselves. They worshipped the spirits of their ancestors and carved magnificent statues of shining crystal in their honor.<br/>\r\nThat all changed when humans discovered the planet. Greedy, ruthless, and powerful, they began to gnaw at the flesh of the planet to get the sacred crystal, and when the original inhabitants resisted, they began to kill them. Now the Wok cities are in ruins and the surviving inhabitants are hiding in caves. But at the moment when it seemed that the ancient civilization had come to an end, a group of young Woks decided to give one last fight. To do so, looking at the mighty machines of the humans, the Woks began to steal parts and assemble their own machines. The days of the invaders were numbered!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n- casual puzzle game<br/>\r\n- 30 levels<br/>\r\n- 90 challenges<br/>\r\n- uniqe car craft system<br/>\r\n- special atmosphere of the alien world", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T04:05:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77b/77ba7371af128a6b0eb9355e6919e5eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["VIRgroup"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["VIRgroup"], "esrb_rating": null}
