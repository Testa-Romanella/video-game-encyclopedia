Use your newfound power as a pip to tilt platforms and launch yourself off jump pads. However, make sure to avoid the reapers that patrol the islands. If they see you, you better start running. Also, keep an eye out for runes while you\u2019re traversing the islands. They depict concept that may aid you in your adventure. Finally, don\u2019t forget to collect the essence you need to power the portal, or you\u2019ll never escape this place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0A short student-made game demoing a fun tilt-based concept.
