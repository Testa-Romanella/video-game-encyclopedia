It's a test project and we just want to see what you guys\u00a0think of it.\u00a0There is no score, no collectables... All you need to do is get to the end.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>A - move left</li><li>D - move right</li><li>Space - jump</li><li>R - quick restart from last checkpoint\u00a0(level stats are untouched)</li><li>P - show pause menu with audio options and hard level restart (start from the beginning and wipe stats)</li><li>Esc - exit full screen mode</li></ul>\n<p>At the same time as you move the cannon ball, you might be able to control other items in the scene, like cannons or pinball paddles. There are no separate key bindings for those. You just control them at the same time as the ball with the same buttons.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Majority of coding, graphics and audio effects by\u00a0Rychu and Grayando.<br/>Parallax background: free download from Unity\u00a0Assets\u00a0(lost name of the author).<br/>Water 2D snippet by:\u00a0Ilham Hasymi Effendi<br/>Music:\u00a0BoxCat Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:47:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8c/d8cf41ff0732cbfc520bb4eb688baee6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dripping Tap"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
