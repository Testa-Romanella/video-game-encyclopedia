Most do not end happily, as it is difficult to maintain control of your vehicle while buzzed and later drunk. There are effects added as you collect more alcohol that simulate various effects drinking causes to your driving skills. At the end of each crash, there are stories that reveal drinking while driving and their real consequences on people.\u00a0To control the car, use WASD, arrow keys, or a controller.
