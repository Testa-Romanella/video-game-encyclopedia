Try to beat your friend's high score and prove you are a skilled gamer.

Soon will be implemented a score based shrink speed and spawn rate so when you reach a certain amount of score the shrink speed and spawn rate of the hexagons increases.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T08:27:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfb/dfb5472bff79856bd21b07d08e3f60ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["MMGinc"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
