We weren't able to get it all finished for kiwijam 16 due to time limits and a lot of stuff we did finish you can't use because of the lack of UI. All we've done since the jam ended is add a lot of new graphics and remove some bugs, but that isn't enough. </p><p>We really like this idea and believe that it has a lot of potential so we're  recreating it with some cool new features that completely change gameplay! This game jam prototype has done it's job, now it's time to make a real game... </p><ul><li>Code - Jeong, Mark, Pascal, Rory</li><li>Art - Patrick, Rory, Vinny</li><li>Writing - Vinny</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ec/6ecf930474ddea885f872fcb4e8ba92d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeoVolente.Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
