Like the real-life event, the original arcade game prominently features Coca-Cola as a sponsor - so as a result the game's full name is Coca-Cola Suzuka 8 Hours. (In recent years, the race has been called the 'Coke Zero Suzuka 8 Hours' to promote a beverage in the company's line.)</p>\n<p>A sequel, Suzuka 8 Hours 2 (\u30b9\u30ba\u30ab\u30a8\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30ef\u30fc\u30ba2, Suzuka Eito Aw\u0101zu Tsu) was released in 1993, but only in Japan; it added three new tracks (the \"Green Hill Circuit\", the \"Bayside Raceway\" and the \"Devil's Canyon Circuit\") to the Suzuka Circuit of the original.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86f/86f1f010925d2c74c429eff27fc2da64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Arc System Works", "NAMCO"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Namco"], "esrb_rating": null}
