Thanks for checking out <em>The Fear\u00a0 Ritual</em>.\u00a0 I started making games way back in my teens in the early 2000's. They were mostly spoofs, like my one-on-one\u00a0 platform shooter, <em>Snakes: 'Coz They're 'Arder Than Worms</em>. Honestly, they were okay, but far from perfect. Then, after leaving high school, I found myself with far less time to experiment with game creation.</p>\n<p><em>The Fear Ritual</em> represents my first foray back into this. I chose to write a short, linear visual novel because my primary role right now is working as an author. I mostly write LGBTQ stories that mix genres, so you can expect more of that going forward, I'm sure. The main thing is though, this allowed me to maintain some familiarity with my current creative style while still embracing the fun of game creation.</p>\n<p>I've left this as 'pay what you want' because, being so short, I wouldn't want to charge too high a fee. Please do consider donating though. I worked alone on this one, and I'm proud of how it turned out. Going forward, I'll get a little more experimental. :)</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you want to check out my books, find out about my projects,\u00a0or just read my anime and comic reviews, you can head over to https://mattdoylemedia.com</p>\n<p>Cheers again!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T04:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e5e1d57ada210c267a650556a8e54fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["mattdoylemedia"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
