Since \"words\" aren't really my strong point, that leaves songs and poems pretty much off the table. So, I decided to express it with the one art form I'm most comfortable, video games.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI don't know if it's depressing melancholy, or dark humor... It wasn't necessarily made for anyone else to play, but just to get it off my chest.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-Dan, a dysfunctional introvert</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70c931d1d9adc45ed534f522621c84a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giant Evil Robot"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
