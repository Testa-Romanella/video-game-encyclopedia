Before playing a map you have to strategically place objects like boosts etc. Depending on how quick you finish the map the more Dots you get. U can use these Dots to buy new levels or customize your Dot. There is also a world wide leaderboard, meaning that you can compete for the world record.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is my first \"real\" game. I have been working on it for over 6 months. It is still under development and I would like to hear whether you like it and what can improve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- arrow keys to move dot and camera<br/>- left mouse button to select and interact with GUI.<br/>- right mouse button to delete placed objects.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T13:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee6/ee6be32b315eef01eb1803a291a81928.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jasperaelvoet"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
