Mech Simulation game. That has been in development for many years now. You have the ability to use not only mechs. But Wheeled vehicles, Jets, Helicopters, Tanks, and many other units in the game.<br/><br/>The game is being developed on the Neo Axis game engine. And is Free to download at any time from my site. <br/>Assault Knights: Reign of Steel<br/></p>\n<p>AK has been in development for about 12 years now. It is more of a hobby for me now. But we do need donations to keep it running. And this is where itch.io comes in. <br/>The file you will be getting from here. Is just a .txt document with links to the game. If you use this page to make donations though it would really help us with the development of Assault Knights.</p>\n<p>AK is a very large game about 7 gig when uncompressed. It is highly playable. With many weapons that has been made directly for the game. The game uses bodypart damage on all vehicles and units to destroy weapons. And do damage to them. AK is loosely \"Like\" Mech Warrior. But has nothing to do with the Mech Warrior Genre or universe.<br/><br/>AK uses two factions, fighting against each other in mech and vehicular combat. <br/>The Assault Knights faction, is a faction of humans. Wile the Omni Faction are a humanoid Alien race. That is hell bent on distroying the Assault Knights. And what they stand for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is multiplayer. Though you can only host probably 2 to 4 players at the moment. But it is very fun to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The full game comes with \u00a0a huge host of maps to play on as well. From beautiful lush tree filled maps. To alien worlds. And tropical terrain, and cities. Each and every map has AI too that you can fight against. Though the AI is stupid and very harsh to fight. It is quite fun to fight them. <br/><br/>If you have any questions. Feel free to discuss it here. Makeing a topic. I would love to hear from your feedback about the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also keep an eye on my Moddb page as well. I am constantly updating it with New Videos and Pics from the game.
