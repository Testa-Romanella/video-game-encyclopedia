I\u00a0bit off more than I could chew with this cube expansion mechanic, that was supposed to be like 2D Katamari Damacy. I got stuck while working on the bow tile to pick up that shot arrows, when I\u00a0ran out of time.\u00a0 I still think it's fun to roll around and pick stuff up and grow the cube though, so I'm submitting so people can see. I will probably pick this project back up after the jam to add much needed fullness to the gaming experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WASD to move cube</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE BOW AND ARROWS ARE SUPER GLITCHY,\u00a0 avoid entirely to prevent breaking the cube expansion mechanic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/a-welby/agglomeration-rotation-v2</p>\n<p>^ song i made for game posted her</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T02:59:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/859770c5a11ec9fdb5bc126d957c695f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["welby"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
