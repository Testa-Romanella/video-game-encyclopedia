They are in conflict because they think that just one of them should exist in the person's world. So they compete between them to have a winner but at the end they should work together. The message of this game is that Good and evil form the whole, both complement each other in a perfect balance. If there is no evil, there is no good; we cannot say that something is right if we do not have a base or a point of reference, if we do not know what is wrong</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f66/f66c03ed8ee473633ae422bbbc3b67f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Unlucky-Alpaca", "Martha Escalante", "AXwain", "Lewis McDonald", "krlosflip22"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
