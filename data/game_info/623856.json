You opened a booby-trapped treasure chest and are now afflicted with a terrible poison! You must now carefully find a way out of the dungeon so you can get help. Fortunately, the poison is not fatal, though it will keep you on the brink of death if left unattended to. You have only a couple potions in your possession, so they must be used sparingly. Use them only when you feel you have no other option. Be quick, but tread lightly!</p>\n<p>This game took the \"down to the wire\" theme to mean to be on your last legs. I thought it would be interesting to explore the calculated risks one takes when they're in a dangerous situation with only a limited resource to protect them. In the end, I felt the healing potions had a role similar to bombs in shoot-'em-ups. You use them either when your back is to the wall, or when you're walking into a situation you know you can't handle, but they're only temporary protection. And since there are so few of them in the game, the decision-making process of whether or not to hit the button is a constant struggle all the way up until you hit the button (or get hit).</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun making this game and trying out some new programming techniques, and I hope you all enjoy playing it! It can be a bit challenging, but if you give it a few chances you can learn all the tricks pretty fast.</p>\n<p><em>Created using Unity 2019.4</em></p>\n<p><em>Additional tools used: Aseprite, JFXR, FL Studio 20, Audacity, Super Tilemap Editor (Unity Plugin)</em></p>\n<p><em>Source files available on request.</em></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys -- Move</p>\n<p>Z -- Attack / Interact</p>\n<p>X -- Use Potion</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Ben \"TrickyTriangles\" Springer</p>\n<p>Special Thanks:</p>\n<p>Canari Games (canarigames.itch.io) - for the dungeon tileset</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:33:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a73/a735336a718854f0773a63b145bd961f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["trickytriangles"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
