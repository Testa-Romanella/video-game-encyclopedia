Unfortunately there is no real winning condition (time constraints), but you can lose when all your objectives are flooded by the storms \ud83d\ude08.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>I'll try to explain and show you in-game, but here's a summary anyway:</p>\n<p>Camera Movement:\u00a0<strong>WASD or Arrow keys and Q an\u00a0E for rotation</strong></p>\n<p>Menu:\u00a0<strong>Escape\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Select: <strong>Left Click</strong></p>\n<p>Deselect:\u00a0<strong>Right Click<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Build/Demolish:\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Left Click</strong></p>\n<p>Rotate building block: <strong>Z</strong></p>\n<p>Choose another block (for example a corner and corner\u00a0connection) :\u00a0<strong>X</strong></p>\n<p>Press \"<strong>End of Day</strong>\" button to get the storm started\u00a0<strong>\ud83d\ude0a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong><strong><em>Unfortunately, it's not very clear in the game and did not have the time to automate it, but you can choose from four different block types for the dikes with \"X\" key\u00a0to make your dikes fit together nicely. Namely: a normal straight block. A block with 1 <strong>diagonal\u00a0side\u00a0</strong>to connect to a straight block or corner block. A block with 2 slanted sides to connect to 2 straight blocks or corner blocks and a corner block to connect to the blocks with diagonal\u00a0sides. Rotate them with \"Z\" to make nice formations.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>There is still a lot I would have liked to do, but unfortunately no time left . But the base idea is implemented. There are also some bugs: for building and placing, among others. But I hope you will still enjoy it :)</p>\n<p><strong><em>* I can not win any prices during the Game Jam as Host, but I would appreciate any feedback on the game</em>\ud83d\ude0a<em>!</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T11:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4c/a4c2d4b2d590b99ad8ac1b96cbf61f15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoedWare"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
