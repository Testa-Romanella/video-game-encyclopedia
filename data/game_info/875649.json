There's some secrets to be find so you'd better get looking.<br/></p>\n<p>There's some spooky elements to this game. Some bits of it may make you jump, but I don't really know if it's 'scary' or not.<br/></p>\n<p>You can certainly play this in HTML5, but the experience will not be  that smooth due to the uncompressed assets (sorry). I recommend  downloading one of the offline versions for the smoothest experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>As usual I made all the sound effects and music.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it. It took like twenty days to make.
