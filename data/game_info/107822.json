I'm currently in the process of making a top down rougelike and I\u00a0wanted to really refine the player controller. I am uploading this build because I\u00a0would really like your feedback and thoughts on how it feels so far, as well as any bugs you can find. Hope you like it!<br/></p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Added zombies and added better death ragdoll effects :)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Also disclamer I did NOT make the models or animations you see in this game. They were made by\u00a0Polygon Blacksmith. If you're in need of some awesome assets you should really check him out.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\n\r\nEnter             = Quit\r\nP                 = Begin spawning zombies\r\nESC               = Pause time (kinda lol)\r\nWASD              = Move\r\nSpace             = Jump\r\nCtrl              = Crouch\r\nE                 = Interact/Pickup\r\nT                 = Wave\r\nC                 = Toggle 'in combat' (changes some stances)\r\nTAB               = Change weapons\r\nLeftClick         = Attack/Shoot/Punch\r\nMiddleMouseButton = Throw current weapon\r\n\n<p>There's not a ton to do but there should be enough to let you get a feel of the motion. Try all the melee weapons out. They're all different weights so some can be thrown better than others. They also all have their own individual knockback values, so\u00a0 some pack a lot more punch than others, others however can attack faster. Try throwing some weapons at the square targets to see if they stick. When the target or the dummys turn red it means you've damaged them. Press P to start spawning in zombies! They're all pooled so it shouldn't lag over time either.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a84/a8449ca861bbd88160314175774afa09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fyxe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
