Well you can answer all three of those questions in PLEXPLORE!</p>\n<p>PLEXPLORE is a 22,888 kb large game in which you must steal ice cream from the intergalactic aliens: Tucker, Herbert, Wilson, Bennett, and Maxwell. They have the ability to read your mind, so don't think they don't know what your plotting.</p>\n<p>Your journey will take place on the planet \"Mowlar.\" Possibly named for it's shape, but that's just a rumor. Mowlar is one of the hottest planets in the universe, so you have been sent with heat-resistant gear to survive. It is also the only planet in it's solar system, if you don't count the moon or the sun that is.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Jump - Space<br/>jUmP iNfInItElY - sPaCe InFiNiTe TiMeS<br/>Walk - WSAD/Arrow Keys<br/>Look Around - Mouse</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy your three-dimensional space experience.
