Beasts of Chi No Mizumi! The story is set in a world where humans have canine features. The game is heavily inspired by certain elements of traditional Japanese culture, though it is not meant to be entirely accurate.\u00a0 This game was made solely to try out coding and making a visual novel with Ren'Py. It is incredibly unfinished, and any more plans I have for the game I likely won't finish for a while.\u00a0For now, I hope you all can appreciate this protoype.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/976/97685c3abebce7d2dab8d2017f58ecb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Sillyfart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
