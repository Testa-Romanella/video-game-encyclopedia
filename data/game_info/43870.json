And literally nothing else.<br/><br/><strong>SETTING: SCARS RUN DEEP</strong><br/><br/>Realistically told, and in a realistic place: The streets and landmarks of Scarborough, Toronto's most notorious, misunderstood and fiercely proud suburb.<br/><br/><strong>TWO CHARACTERS, ONE FATE</strong><br/><br/>Living in a common time and place, Little Red Lie alternates you through the perspectives of two individuals who never meet, but who are deeply connected nevertheless. Explore the dynamics of their lives, relationships and decisions as both of them come face-to-face with the consequences of who they are and where they come from.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-10T14:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/709/709934520d1662669fbde2d70daff1fa.jpg", "website": "http://www.littleredlie.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 25, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["WZO Games", "WZOGI"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WZOGI"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
