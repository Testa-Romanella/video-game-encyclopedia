I just want to see how people feel about the mechanics.</p>\n<p>This is a game I have been working on for a while, using a few common puzzles and combining them, both having pieces activate each other as well as some pieces controlling the shape, size etc of each other.\u00a0The levels as of now are somewhat all over the place.</p>\n<p>I am not great at aesthetics, the game is mostly cubes and spheres right now.<br/><br/>The main 3 puzzles used are pushing blocks, connect the pipes and turn on all the lights...\u00a0I am trying to combine their mechanics in every way possible to make one big game from multiple smaller ones.<br/><br/>This game has autosave, it will save your level progress as you play for if you need a break.</p>\n<p>As of now there are 30 levels plus the tutorials...\u00a0I have more ideas for levels, I just wanted to make sure this idea was likable.</p>\n<p>Last thing of note, the game likes to keep an aspect ratio, changing your screen size will make it snap to the aspect ratio in question after about a second.<br/><br/>This game has keyboard and mouse controls<br/>WASD/arrow keys to move.<br/>Space for activating or exiting terminals (Also entering levels).<br/>Z to exit terminals.<br/>Clicking for using puzzles.<br/>U to undo.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to talk to me about how the game feels, here is a discord\u00a0I just made:\u00a0https://discord.gg/vSqy3KvnfZ<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T17:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca3/ca3c6bcb85b37c8ec9c4ffbdd5ead1bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["adamzer0"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
