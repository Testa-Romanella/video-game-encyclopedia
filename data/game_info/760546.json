As there was additional topic of the game \"Death is no the end\", so in this game it's literally this - you don't die after death (at least not the first time).\r\n</p>\r\nControls and rules\r\n<p>Every 4th powerup collected you gain one heart (up to 7 hearts). If you are \"dead\", collecting 3 broken hearts and 4 pierogi will resurrect you.\r\n</p>\r\nAdditional information\r\n<p>Every assets in this game is made by me. You can see from art that I changed my art style mid project and had no time for changes. Only thing that I haven't done is sound effects and music. I tried (movement sound is made by me), but it's more difficult than I thought and it took me more time than I wished. This is my first game that I took more time polishing than usual and I am very pleased how it turned out. As always there is many things that I whished I could do if I had more time (like art for dead player), but still it's good enough.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T05:00:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe609b798094d8ace8ea8b0474efee05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["aweczet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
