Help your friendly-neighborhood-nuclear-fallout-survivor out by getting his some nutritious and delicious cans of Tomato Soup! Who knows maybe he won't die :D\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made for the <em>Paint Jam 2021</em></p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>The only thing you need is a mouse and a finger to play this game. (Only control is Left-Click).</p>\n<p>If you can't find the Play button in the main menu its on the sad and empty soup shelf.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get as many cans as you can within 60 seconds. Losing 3 times will cause the game to end.</p>\n<p>Some extra explanation on the mini-games</p>\n<p>Alligator: If the can drops in the water then alligators will eat it, keep it up in the air by clicking on it.</p>\n<p>Arms: Some pesky shoppers are trying to take the last can in the soup store, teach em a lesson by\u00a0<em>cutting their arms in halve</em>, by clicking on the X on their elbow area.</p>\n<p>Basket: Your at a store checkout getting a nice can of soup, but for some reason a bunch of heavy bottles are getting in the way! You can click and drag the bottles and can to move them, the bottles are a bit heavier so if there are any on the can it could weight it down. We only want a can in the basket so make sure no flying bottles land in there.</p>\n<p>Shooting: The audacity of some people to be shooting cans during a nuclear fallout... Save those cans by using this neat sign you found to block the bullets, the sign will follow your cursor so just keep it in front of a can with a reticle on it to block the incoming bullet.</p>\n\n<p>Coding &amp; Art - Me</p>\n<p>Music - The neighbor</p>\n<p>A single art asset - you know who you are</p>\n<p>Sound Effects - ZapSplat</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:14:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/960/960dc63c7fc051e56577e24bd2fd43a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yeperdeedooda"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
