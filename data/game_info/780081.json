It will roll for a random number, if successful it will spawn a cube in that position. The new cube is given a new color based on its relative position from its parent and will make the same spawn check to spawn new cubes around it but with a lowered probability. If a cube spawns a cube on top of another it will eat the older one to get a better chance at spawning cubes of its own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T08:35:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/5690e2946ef0d164ee43a93e657bab13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Natedog769"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
