The game\u00a0is loosely based on the story of Dagmar Johanne Amalie Overby one of the most notorious serial killers in the history of Denmark. She would adopt and take care of unwanted children from the ones who could pay for it and would then kill the children and make up excuses for their sudden disappearance. For these terrible acts of cruelty she was given the name \"<em>Englemagersken\" (The Angel Maker).</em><br/><br/>The player finds themselves in the role of Dagmars handyman who has been given the opportunity to to assist Dagmar in her everyday needs and simple tasks, unknowing of the horrors that take place in her home. The player must solve puzzles and look for clues to uncover what transpires around them and uncover the truth of Dagmars crimes.\u00a0<br/><br/>The game was made in three months time\u00a0as a bachelors project at The Royal Danish Academy (KADK) for the Game &amp; Interaction design program in 2019.\u00a0 There are currently no plans to make any further updates. The project explores the use of non-Euclidean level design and what effect it has on the player experience.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:01:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d2403d001a9f812b33c20c14cb0c912.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A.
