This is mostly a prototype with the gameplay and enemies being built off of the tutorial first person shooter that comes with Unity. This is more of a prototype for the Backrooms level itself, and will probably not stay as a first person shooter like this. May transform into a multiplayer Halo Infection like game with this setting.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T11:02:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/518c1d9202a613fa3f6100dc1a80d5fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KatsuyaTheFuuk"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
