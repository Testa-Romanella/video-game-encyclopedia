Thanks Jonas! It was my first ever jam! Had a blast!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The theme was \"Collaborate With AI\"</p>\n<p>So naturally I found myself an AI text generator and told it something along the lines of:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\"What is the best game known to man that will WIN Wowie Jam 4.0?\"</p>\n<p>It responded with:</p>\n<p>\"Cutting for stone and sculpting without flaw</p>\n<p>Battlestations Pacific because...\u00a0Defies description.</p>\n<p>You have or you haven't played\u00a0but it will win when...\u00a0You've been on strike,\u00a0and can't help\"</p>\n<p>So basically I tried to do that. You cut through stone, you could say you \"sculpt\" structures. I was gonna add \"Battlestations\" but I scraped that idea. Also the baddies are from the \"Pacific\" ocean. I didn't do anything with \"defies description\" I took \"It will win when\" as it winning the jam so I didn't put that in my game. \"You've been on strike and can't help\" Is when you get hit and die.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:35:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/891/891c6d6d0857b86771c44597b0e31e23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Black Frawg"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
