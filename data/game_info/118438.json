During daytime you will be able to shape the Museum by buying new exhibition rooms, installing security systems, storing paintings in caveau rooms and expanding the building to have more floors to exhibit artworks! During nighttime the Museum will receive some unexpected visitors... security systems must be installed to detect their presence and then security guards must be sent in the specific rooms to catch the burglars and avoid having paintings stolen. What if you have some artworks stolen? Well... there is always the option to hire a black market expert and have the chance to get back stolen goods. To sum it up \"It's another day: collect art, secure your Museum, make money and HAVE FUN!\".</p>\n<p>Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/quadrieladri/</p>\n<p>MORE INFO: http://www.stupidipixel.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/175/175025a390b2060cdb0b350e7c9680ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Stupidipixel"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
