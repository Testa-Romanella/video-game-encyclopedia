This game -my personal passion project for the past few years - is meant to pay tribute to that wonderful era of the early personal computers, the first arcades, and the first consoles.<br/><br/><br/>\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a<h3>THE TWIST</h3>Although I was and still am passionate about games, I was not -and am not- extremely skilled at playing them. One of the things I have always hated the most is having to start over and over again from the beginning. That's why in SUPER RETRO RETRY the order of the one hundred levels changes each time, and due to this small change, another one emerged almost organically, which might seem much more drastic: the player has only one life. When there's no monotonous need to repeat the same levels again and again, the number of lives becomes almost irrelevant. Once you master the game, one life is enough to overcome all obstacles.<br/><br/><br/>\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a<h3>THE DISCLAIMER</h3>When it came to developing the game, finding the right level of difficulty was quite challenging. I wanted the game to be challenging but not frustrating, and to convey to the player the feeling that overcoming the levels was always possible. What I didn't want, under any circumstances, was to artificially inflate the difficulty or unnecessarily lengthen the game. That's why an experienced player should not take more than a few minutes to complete it, although I trust that reaching that goal for the first time will take much longer.<br/><br/>- J.
