Some are near complete and will be released soon. Here is a roadmap of things to come.<br/><ul><li>League Challenge (Single Player mode) is a sequence of tournaments where you compete against 30 other teams through 4 events of increasing skill and difficulty. Each team has unique AI with varying skills and personalities. For players seeking a real challenge, the tournaments can be played in 1v2(Hard) or 1v3(Iron Man) modes of difficulty.<br/></li><li>More Gear is nearing completion, including 2 more female uniforms, 2 more helmets and 1 more disc. The new disc (Kyokusen), which means \"curve\" in Japanese, is intended for players skilled in the use of arced throws. Arced throws are a great way to get around overly defensive players.<br/></li><li>More Gameplay like power-ups, environmental effects, new match types are all in development<br/></li><li>More Arenas are on their way. Close quarters 1v1 arenas have already been created and are being used in single player modes. Other multiplayer maps exist in various degrees of completion and will be released as they are completed.</li></ul>COMBAT DISCS<br/>Each disc has unique characteristics that enable it fly faster, stabilize better, curve stronger, generate shields and offer some degree of assisted targeting.<br/><br/>Current Discs offered in the League<br/><strong>Protector</strong> (upper left) a powerful and stable disc with excellent defense. Easier to throw straight and still capable of arcs as needed.<br/><strong>Faith</strong> (right side) a balanced disc with great speed, curvability and defense. An excellent disc for any situation.<br/><strong>Shita</strong> (lower left) a light and fast disc requiring a skilled hand to keep stable but deadly quick in the hands of a veteran.ENVIRONMENTS<br/>Each environment is unique, requiring learning, skill and adjustment to make the most of each battle.<br/><br/><strong>The Station</strong> is a complex tunnel network with various sized rooms intertwined. Use your disc to teleport to higher ground, then jump down the chutes to literally get the drop on unsuspecting opponents.<br/><br/><strong>Shroom Garden</strong> an interesting planet spotted with giant mushrooms and other plant life. Teleport to the top of the mother shroom in the center to gaze upon the beautiful purple alien sky with its bright blue star and colored fog. Then jump down below and use the smaller fungi as organic cover in battle.<br/><br/><strong>Dark Pyramid</strong> is a smaller, more intense map composed of 2 independent levels, recommended for 4 players. The main area is a neon pyramid surrounded by angled walls, great for bouncing discs into opponents. Use the teleporters to warp below into the very dark basement where you'll need to use your disc light to see. Down here you'll find paneling, computers and other equipment to use as cover while you stock other opponents by following their disc lights.COMMUNITY FEEDBACKPurchasing this game in early access helps to fund the further development of this game.
