{"id": 53289, "slug": "fire-emblem-the-binding-blade", "name": "Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade", "name_original": "Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade", "description": "<p>Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld video game console. It is the sixth entry in the Fire Emblem series, the first title produced for the system, and the first title to appear on a handheld console. It was released in Japan in March 2002.<br />\nThe Binding Blade is set on the fictional continent of Elibe, which is dominated by humans in the wake of an ancient war between humanity and dragons. The story follows Roy from the small country of Pherae as he leads a growing army against the forces of King Zephiel of the kingdom of Bern, who is gradually taking over Elibe. As with other Fire Emblem games, battles take place on a grid-based map, with player units assigned character classes taking part in single combat with enemies and being subject to permanent death if defeated.<br />\nThe Binding Blade began development as a Nintendo 64 title called Fire Emblem: Maiden of Darkness, but internal changes caused the project to change its platform to the GBA, scrapping nearly all of its original content in the process. One of Intelligent Systems&#39; main goals was to make the game more forgiving to newcomers than the notoriously difficult Fire Emblem: Thracia 776. Upon release, it was praised by critics and sold over 345,000 units. Despite never releasing overseas, Roy&#39;s appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee contributed to the localization of its 2004 prequel, released overseas as Fire Emblem.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-10T16:06:02", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 4.11, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 23, "owned": 25, "beaten": 49, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 7, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 38, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 38, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Nintendo", "Intelligent Systems"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
