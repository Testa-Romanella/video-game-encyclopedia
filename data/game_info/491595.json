Our security measures proved to be woefully inadequate. The airlock and containment cell area was compromised almost immediately, and the armed response team dispatched was eliminated before a single radio status update could be delivered upon their arrival. <br/><br/>They were dead before they were able to tell us what was killing them. We don't even know what they saw before they died. The cameras show nothing but a blur, and recorded nothing but screaming and silence.<br/><br/>Within an hour, the casualties had mounted to the point that the computer is telling me we have just three people alive as I'm writing this.<br/>Three people left, out of almost ten thousand, in just over an hour. The rest, eaten and absorbed, repurposed to become more of\u2026 Whatever this is. We never stood a chance. <br/><br/>I imagine that, very soon now, the few of us remaining will be joining our comrades in hell.<br/><br/>We will not be with you for the coming apocalypse. <br/><br/>I do not envy you.<br/><br/><strong>It is very hungry.</strong><br/><br/>//REVISED RESPONSE: XLL operations site declared defunct and written off as non-viable for future use; forwarding escalation protocols to governmental oversight for containment/disposal; all Xenoscience assets declared expendable, recommend thermonuclear obliteration from orbit", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T04:27:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bdb29036b6e60c3bb103404eb853248.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ivan Valeryevich Suvorov"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Screenwave Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
