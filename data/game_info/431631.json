You have 7 lives and 24 Mana potions (24/7 get it?) every Mana Potion is a Fireball that you can throw and which kills an enemy if you hit. If you don't have any potions left. You use your lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So be careful.</p>\n<p>This Gane is far from polished and far from the original game I wanted to make but in 48 I just could not have done more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy what I made and if you have any Tips or advices pls contact me because I still want to work on this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T10:01:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/554/554801ce2a66332977eed2d5d69304bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["megamindboss"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
