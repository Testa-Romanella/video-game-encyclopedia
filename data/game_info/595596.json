That being said I still ask that you be as critical as possible so that in the future I may be able to make something that actually plays well. I hope you enjoy none the less!</p>\n\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>The world has slowly been taken over by the void, with the only way of stopping it is for one organism to plunge deeper into it, sealing it for good. The problem of the matter is that the world has become distorted, to the point where certain aspects can not be seen by the naked eye. You alone poses the ability to alternate between these perspectives, making you the only one able to seal the void for good.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to Move</p>\n<p>SPACE to Jump</p>\n<p>E to Change View</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:38:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a7/2a76586cc9b7f59db73c684ff1969b15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BorderDestroyerGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
