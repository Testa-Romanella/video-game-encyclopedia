They looked up and down, left and right, and saw a rocket set for the moon, unexpectedly taking off in 10 seconds. Then they saw their chance and grabbed onto the side of the rocket and before they knew it they were in orbit.</p><p>Crash landing on the moon would take all\u00a0their friendship to manage on the cold environment. But just\u00a0when they least expected it, a hoard of aliens attacks them! The heroes must use their strengths to combine their powers and face the evil aliens before they freeze on the darkness of the moon caves.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T07:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd0/dd07cc253cefe4823602ce8a15ed29dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dave22153"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
