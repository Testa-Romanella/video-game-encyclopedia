The game is completely FREE to play and can be found using the RPG Maker MV Player app (via free download on the eShop) by searching the aforementioned name, or Game ID: 405.</p>\n<p>Steps to Download 'Kingdom of Neandria':</p>\n<p>1. Go to the Nintendo eShop on your Nintendo Switch and search for RPG Maker MV Player. Download it! (It's free!)</p>\n<p>2. Open the RPG Maker MV Player software, then search for 'Kingdom of Neandria' or Game ID: 405.</p>\n<p>3. Voila! The game is now on your Nintendo Switch!</p>\n<p>Game Synopsis:</p>\n<p>The game starts with you, the player, waking up to your daughter (who is very ill) speaking a strange tongue in her sleep. The problem? Your daughter was born a mute. The following day, after conferring with a doctor from a nearby town and your father-in-law, you determine that magic may lie at the root of your daughter's condition. You decide that the next best course of action is to seek out the local witch doctor who lives in the woods nearby. The game includes a village, a forest, a mountain, a beach, surrounding plains around the village, and the game's first dungeon, as well as dozens of NPCs, lots of story, and a few sidequests.</p>\n\n<p>A Message From The Creator:</p>\n<p>Inspired by classics such as Final Fantasy V, Breath of Fire III, and the recent CrossCode, my primary focus in the development of 'Kingdom of Neandria' was to create lively environments with a memorable atmosphere, engaging characters, and a plot that contained elements of mystery, comedy, and tragedy. While combat recalls traditional turn-based JRPGs, there are no random encounters and no world map in 'Kingdom of Neandria'. All enemies are seen on-screen and locations consist of interconnected maps as experienced in games like A Link to the Past and Secret of Mana, to cite only a couple of my other inspirations.</p>\n<p>Please give it a play through if anything that I've mentioned here even mildly perks your interest. I think you will not be disappointed!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T05:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02fb24664525aa877f0f5d281a0d6c27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nestor_Takeshima"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
