Dare you approach Ghost Mountain? Grapple with debilitating dread in this slice of old-school interactive fiction.<br/><br/>Made with PunyInform, a library for writing text adventures for old computers. Enjoy (?) some Infocom-style adventuring on the humble C64. Content warning: vague unease; obscure threat; endless trees.\u00a0 Not recommended for orophobes.<br/><br/>Zip file includes .d64 file for Commodore 64, plus a .z3 file that will run on any platform with a Z-Machine interpreter. I recommend playing it on C64 though.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T06:30:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59af2b4ba0fcfd16860d405a7d9f2380.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["compdelta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
