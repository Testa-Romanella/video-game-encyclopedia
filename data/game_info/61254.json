BattleBlade features an hour long Campaign with 5 battles along with visual novel style dialogue detailing Kaiku's valiant attempt at defending Earth from Vanto and his horde of Demons. As well as the campaign, the game features a PVP Versus mode allowing for you to battle your friends and live out your dream battles. But that's not all, BattleBlade also features a PVE Versus mode allowing for you to fight an AI Opponent of whomever you choose and train yourself! <br/><br/>Moraliyen is the commander of the Gods, and he has commanded Kaiku, the Goddess of Earth to protect Earth from a recent attack by the Demons. Kaiku accepts this task,  after all, this is not the first time she has been given this objective, in fact, she's getting a bit bored of having to do it. What Kaiku does not realize is that this task may not be as familiar as it first seems.<br/><br/>I created this game as a solo developer over the course of one year, and I really hope you enjoy playing it.<br/><br/><ul><li> 2D Fighter Gameplay<br/></li><li> Visual Novel Style Dialogue<br/></li><li> Narrative with twists and turns inspired by Kingdom Hearts<br/></li><li> Local Multiplayer Gameplay<br/></li><li> Perplexing and Extraordinary Characters</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf7/cf76ee2924058219b7794cd5d3b217b2.jpg", "website": "https://roxra.github.io/BattleBlade/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roxra"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Roxra"], "esrb_rating": null}
