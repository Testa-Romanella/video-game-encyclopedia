Besides the health indicators, all the sprites used were created or drawn IRL and scanned into Unity. The player is a plane drawn onto a piece of paper, the enemies are paper planes, the projectiles are crumpled paper balls, and the background was drawn by hand.\u00a0The mechanics are simple (WASD to move and SPACE to shoot). There is a working death screen that gives the player the option to try again after they die.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T19:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fc/6fcef438f5dee8d111b15512c21ca0c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["theeb12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
