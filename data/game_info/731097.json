The goal is to reach the crown at the top, by evading guards and using the swords you find along the way to smash a path through to the end. Broken walls may obstruct your enemies, but be careful not to smash a staircase you need to progress :D<br/></p>\n<p>In the middle of some major bugfixes, sorry.<br/>Known Issues:<br/>Some stairways break weirdly.<br/>Some guards jitter.<br/>Lag spike every five seconds [this is due to unoptimized pathfinding code.]<br/>The game is ugly as sin. That's the next planned update.<br/>The 'stealth' mechanic is lacking - I will be adding proper hiding places.<br/></p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p>WASD: move</p>\n<p>Q: Force Push debris [destroys smaller pieces.]<br/></p>\n<p>Left Click: Swing Weapon<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T10:25:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae0d54760a4b9d7e58edc2c462db9684.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EtherealScorpions"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
