The original version had a system where the player would have to decelerate for a few frames before turning around when changing direction. This one takes out that deceleration time. Also, the acceleration rate has increased. I think it is a little less annoying this way!</p><p>Hello!</p><p>This is a game I made for Idle Thumbs Wizard Jam 2016</p><p>https://www.idlethumbs.net/forums</p><p>This is my first completed game!
