{"id": 745137, "slug": "dont-be-late-dunkey", "name": "Don't be late Dunkey!", "name_original": "Don't be late Dunkey!", "description": "<p>Don't be late Dunkey! is a 3D Plaftormer where you help Donkey to go to the last car of the train, otherwise he won't be able to catch the next train. For that you will need to overcome a series of obstacles and enemies unique for each car.<br/></p><p>-<br/><br/>This is the very first 3d game that I ever done, my idea would be to have multiple trains that you need to catch to get in you destination, but as a PoC I only made the first Train. For this project I needed to learn Unreal Engine and C++ from the beginning, so it is still at very early stage.<br/><br/>If you are curious how I made, leave a comment and I can share the source code in a Git, also I have a playlist of all tutorials that used to finish this version.<br/><br/>Also if you find any issues or have suggestion, I will be very happy to work on it.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>- 1D.STUDIO (UE Marketplace)\u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0 3D Assets<br/>aminnaderi.mark@gmail.com</p>\n<p>- Quaternius\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0 3D Assets<br/>https://quaternius.com/</p>\n<p>- Tobi\u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0 3D Assets<br/> https://www.cgtrader.com/-tobi</p>\n<p>- Varrrg\u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0 3D Assets<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/varrrg</p>\n<p>- Safeersany\u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0 2D Asset - Grass<br/> https://br.pinterest.com/safeersany/</p>\n<p>- Hannes Delbeke \u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0 2D Asset - Ground<br/> https://hannesdelbeke.blogspot.com/2012/10/handpainted-textures.html</p>\n<p>- Marcel Plagmann\u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0 3D Assets<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/plaggy</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 Bart \u00a0 | \u00a0 Music on Train <br/> https://opengameart.org/content/jump-and-run-8-bit<br/> https://opengameart.org/content/jump-and-run-tropical-mix</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 Oiboo\u00a0 \u00a0| \u00a0 Music\u00a0 Game Over<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/game-over-bad-chest-sfx</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 Remaxim \u00a0 | \u00a0 Music Completed the Game<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/win-music-2</p>\n<p>- Fupi \u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0 Sound Effect<br/> https://opengameart.org/content/plingy-coin</p>\n<p>- Jalastram \u00a0 | \u00a0 Sound Effect<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/sound-effects-sfx015</p>\n<p>- Ignas D \u00a0 | \u00a0 Sound Effect<br/> https://opengameart.org/content/jumping-man-sounds</p>\n<p>- Phoenix1291\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 | \u00a0 Sound Effect<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/sound-effects-pack-2</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 EmoPreben\u00a0\u00a0 | \u00a0 Sound Effect<br/> https://opengameart.org/content/playersounds-1-by-emopreben</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T11:30:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a4/1a49d55c3b91b0ad6345877104635665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Felipe Ourives Figueiredo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
