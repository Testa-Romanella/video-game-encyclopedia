I\u2019m <em>Tiamo Pastoor</em> (otherwise known as <em>Pandaqi</em>), an indie developer who (almost) exclusively makes local multiplayer games. Try some of my other games as well. (Links lead to my game studio website.)\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>A Recipe for Disaster\r\n  </li><li>Totems of Tag\r\n  </li><li>Carving Pumpkins &amp; Dwarfing Dumplings</li></ul>\n<p>I also wrote a detailed devlog about the development of this game: <a appear=\"\" finished!=\"\" here=\"\" it's=\"\" link=\"\" when=\"\" will=\"\"><br/></a></p>\n<p>As usual, the starting idea was simple \u2026 then problems happened \u2026 and the final product is absolutely nothing like the original idea. Writing a system that allows natural movement <em>for so many different bugs/powerups</em>, both on and off a spider web, which constantly changes, was a challenge. And when I thought it\u2019d be fun to allow <em>moving</em> the points of web as you go, I silently cursed myself.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in any of the game\u2019s mechanics, the source code is freely available here: Windowsilk [GitHub] [Source] (As per requirement of the GitHub Game Off jam.)\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you have any <strong>feedback</strong>, let me know. Games made for jams can always improve immensely, especially one as ambitious as this. \r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>There were several ideas I couldn\u2019t implement (due to the time constraint). These might be added later. But by all other accounts, the game is completely finished.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:43:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/044/0440337aa7e2d5d7714a9c57af5ec03c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Pandaqi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
