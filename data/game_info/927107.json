For the demo, I reverse engineered the front-end of the Toge Productions game \"Coffee Talk\". This includes recreating the splash sequence as well as the Start and Options menus.

You can try a playable build of the front-end demo here!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T11:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7af191d92bd4e9577e55c4ad144897b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Wilson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
