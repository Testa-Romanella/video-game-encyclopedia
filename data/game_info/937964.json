Fungi use fibers called hyphae (that as a group are referred to as mycelium), to take in food. The mycelium can remain dormant under the ground for many seasons, similar to the roots of plants. Each mycelium struggles to stretch its edges, braving the unknown and exploring forward through the mud and wood until it reaches the surface and grows mushrooms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T20:39:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/513/513d3ed54011f06ac7137cf19fe79cb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["s.su997"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
