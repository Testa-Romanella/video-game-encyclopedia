'Exo Racing' was initially illegal sport of racing around and inside of the city. Legalized by authorities but still very dangerous. At least - that's what you see on the outside. But the truth is - the whole city is a nest of criminal organizations that pretty much controls the entirely place, from police to judges. The player takes a role of one of previous Exo-Racers who had quit the field and now, a very dramatic situation forced him to return to Exo Racing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/256/256853e99d2e513521d974335a4d5daa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Angry Angel Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IceTorch Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
