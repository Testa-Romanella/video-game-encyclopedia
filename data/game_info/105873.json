While doing so has no direct influence on gameplay, it can greatly help make tactical decisions in the future, in regards to which pills to take first, and which pills to stay well away from.</p>\n<p>Best of luck, and don't forget to not die.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Controls</strong></em></p>\n<p>Movement: Arrow keys/WASD/either Xbox Joystick/D-Pad<br/></p>\n<p>Mark Pill: Space/Right Click/Left Bumper</p>\n<p>Toggle selected pill: Movement Up/Down</p>\n<p>Toggle selected mark: Movement Left/Right/Mouse Pointer/Xbox Joystick<br/></p>\n<p>Cancel Mark Pill: Escape/Left Click/ B</p>\n<p>Submit: Return/A<br/></p>\n<p>Pause: Escape/Start</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Credits</strong></em><br/></p>\r\nDavid<br/>Hubber<br/>Game Design &amp; ProgrammingSebastian<br/>Parfitt<br/>Game Design, Programming \r\n&amp; Audio<br/>Original Ludum Dare 40 Team<br/>Sebastian Parfitt, David Hubber, \r\nVadym Strelchenko, Julian Geheeb, \r\nDavid Madl<br/>Special Thanks to<br/>Chelsey Waldeck, Ludum Dare, \r\nGames Bavaria , Werk 1 &amp; Unity\r\n\n<p><strong><em>Changelog<br/></em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>b1.2.2<br/></em></p>\n<ul><li>Online highscores no longer allow duplicate names</li><li>Each mark may now only be applied to one pill, with previously marked <br/>pills being umarked when their mark is applied to a different pill</li><li>Added online lowscores to compliment the online highscores and provide positive, wholesome motivation to struggling players</li><li>Game will now automtically check for updates on main menu</li><li>Added sound to pill wheel</li><li>Fixed central pill marking icon from sometimes not disapearing when the marking wheel is closed</li><li>Prevented ghost enemies pill from spawning in first level</li></ul>\n<p><strong>View all past updates</strong>\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f65/f65274db799886bac66757c01a92134b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Shy Tea Games", "sergamer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
