You are a pirate in search of treasure and have found an island full of treasure-hoarding octopuses. You must fend off the ever-increasing hoards of octopuses and collect as much treasure as possible before you run out of health. <br/></p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was completed in an extremely small time window due to the nature of the project (Game Jam), and as such, may have minor bugs and/or be lacking is some features one might expect from similar games.
