I do MFGJ annually to see how much I progress each year. This jam actually ended on my 17th birthday. The first time I did this jam was during summer when I was 15 years old, the game I submit was Promises of Simulated Cake. I didn't realize how much time school takes away from game development. I felt like I was accomplishing nothing everyday, and my ADHD wasn't helping. The previous two times I\u00a0did this game jam I did not have school, and I was able to get a lot done. I plan to complete the game post-jam however. Currently what we have is essentially just an environment, there are a few creatures too if you want to check them out, fait warning though, don't get eaten by a glow shark or you'll have to restart the game.</p>\n<p>Music - MichaelBogaMusic</p>\n<p>Sound Design - Knives</p>\n<p>Concept Art -\u00a0PringleTheTringle</p>\n<p>Writing - SNOW</p>\n<p>Character Art - ameen6</p>\n<p>3D Artist - Soulex</p>\n<p>Assistant 3D Artist - Sk3lly</p>\n<p>Programmer - Soulex</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:36:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a27e2c26bf38112e3c5b559ab0763699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soulexx"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
