The UI can be completely controlled by the keyboard, but the cursor works to navigate it\u00a0as well.<br/><br/>Best of luck, and have fun!<br/><br/>Contact the dev - @JagSamurott</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T16:18:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4e/c4e544b6c78cc3207f54a86ca5c25487.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["JagSamurott"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
