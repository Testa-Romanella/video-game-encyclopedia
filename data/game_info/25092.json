Players use the cash earned when they win \n      a race to power up their machine. Not only can they change the \"TIRE\" \n      and \"BODY\" of their vehicles, but they also can add \"SPECIAL\" parts. \n      Jump over tall obstacles with a \"HOPPER\" and blast past rivals at \n      incredible speeds with \"NITRO.\" What multiplayer game would be complete \n      without attack items? Use a forward-launching \"GRENADE\" or a \n      backward-dropping \"BOMBER\" to blow up and knock away rivals. Outmaneuver \n      rivals in all eight heats to become the champion. Any combination of Wii \n      Remote\u2122 and Nintendo GameCube\u2122 controllers can be used in multiplayer \n      games.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
