I worked solo to put something simple together while also participating in the rest of the event - a short, playable proof of concept that is easily extensible.<br/></p>\n<p>This could be easily replicated by someone with minimum experience, as made clear during the stream segment where I discussed this project and showed my work - it mostly consists of very simple elements combined in such a way as to make a game that looks chaotic.</p>\n<p>This game is super incomplete! Zero polish whatsoever! No retry button, no timer, and no run animations for most of the creatures. It's also missing the 'dash' mechanic I never got around to implementing, when 'Dash' was literally the theme/prompt for the game jam.</p>\n<p>That said, there's something playable to amuse yourself with for like a minute. Hope bouncing around for a couple of seconds gives you something to smile about today!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T04:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef7/ef75e932bb42dff7bdc8684519b14c26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Omergosh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
