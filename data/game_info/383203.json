But you are being hunted and targeted by a murderous mob. The reasons for their hate is unknown. Their weapons are sharp. You are scared. Can you find the multiple exits while avoiding the mobs? Talk to the people on the street and inside buildings. Maybe they can help?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player is thrown in as the helpless victim in this game, mostly at the mercy of the people in the city. Can you survive?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was built as part of BYOG 2019 jam where the theme was <strong><em>\u201cTo know what is right and choose to ignore it is the act of a coward.\" </em></strong>In our game, the player has no agency for \"ignoring\" the wrong as they are the victim. The courage, or lack thereof, to go with the theme is shown by the ordinary citizens, some of them risking their survival to save you. Can you find them in the city? <br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls - WASD to move. Left Shift to run, and E to interact. \"Escape\" brings up the pause menu.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:45:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cf3c2a2e41cb68cd172511e65d731bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["gamedolphin", "jinincarnate"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
