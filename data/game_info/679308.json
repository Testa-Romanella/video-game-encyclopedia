We got together for 24 hours and made a bunch of small and fast games. Now we've compiled them all together into one big super-game, all made of 20+ smaller games!\u00a0This version of the build also includes some games from a test run of the jam we did a few months ago.\u00a0Play it now! Enjoy it! Have fun!</p>\n<p>The Game Design &amp;\u00a0Art Collaboration (GDA) is a student-run club based out of UC Santa Cruz.

Then in the visual novel section (use the arrow keys to select choices and space to acknowledge dialogue), choose to take on the heist (instead of stealing the snake woman's wallet). Then go straight down. Once you enter the bank, steer towards the treasure chest.
