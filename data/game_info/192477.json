Player 2 uses left and right arrow keys to move left and right, and up arrow key to shoot. Use \"W\" and the down arrow key to activate power-ups for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Power-ups</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Power-ups can can be activated in singles or doubles if you have two in a row. It's better to get doubles because the effect lasts longer. The \"Red Power-up\" heals you, the \"Blue Power-up\" gives you a shield and makes you invincible for a shot period, the \"Green Power-up\" gives you a temporary damage increase and lets you destroy blocks faster, and the yellow \"power-up\" shoots a missile back at you to discourage spamming your missiles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/106/1066b865ea350fc21dee6b19cd57044a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scu11y"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
