Your goal is to beat an escape room, but clues that you find in one game are crucial to solve riddles in another. Both games are joined together with clues and you can't finish one without another. <br/></p>\n<p>All assets were created by the two of us during gamejam.</p>\n<p> We hope that  you will enjoy our little experiment, as much as we were enjoying  making it. Have fun! <br/></p>\n<p>Link to other game: https://gummibot.itch.io/escape-together-3d\r\n    <br/> \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:43:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9f/b9f62fa4d802a257de50382912c8b17e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["choochoothetrain", "Gummibot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
