This means the base game is not ready yet. Therefore, I ask you to take 2 minutes and fill out the feedback form, which you can find in the top right corner of the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer Notice:<br/></strong>I have several goals with this game.\u00a0 On the one hand, everyone who owns a Tiny Dino should be able to play his Dino. Secondly, I would like to release the game for smartphones as soon as more content is available.</p>\n<p>A big point would be to make a P2E game out of it, which is still open. I would like to thank the community for the wonderful support and ask for your patience for the upcoming updates. I try to work on the game every free minute.</p>\n<p>Stay tiny - Kiny</p>\n\n<p>Developer | Tiny Dino Community<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T12:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd6cba549fe9ffa0463428fc3530b2f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kiny"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
