I've wanted to do one for a while but wasn't free during many of the previous events.</p>\n<p>I finally have some time off and decided to give this one a go.</p>\n<p>Based on the theme of \"Sacrifices must be made\", I decided that the player would play as Hernan Cortes (a blue cube with a fancy hat) fending off hordes of Aztecs (red, green, and purple cubes) seeking to sacrifice themselves to the Gods (who I didn't have time to implement). The idea being this was their last ditch effort to defeat Cortes.</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun making this game and I got further than I thought I would, I also realised I need to tame my feature creep...</p>\n<p>Sadly I didn't have time to make any music, or sound, or a main menu, or a tutorial, or a bunch of other stuff... But there's some mechanics!</p>\n<p>Definitely going to carry on with this project after the voting, but now I think I'll hibernate for the week.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/605f81a7e558d9d363d8a55c2e97ff83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FuzzyMelon94"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
