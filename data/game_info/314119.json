We plan on releasing a post-jam-version once we finally find out how to fix the scriptable objects.</em><br/><br/>This game is about your descent into a realm of darkness and the things you have to do to come back to your own dimension.\r\n</p>\n<p>You play a mage who works with dangerous spells that have cast them into a ghastly realm. They know to get back to their home, they need to cast a demanding spell. But for it to work, they first have to\u00a0find the shards of a real soul and put them back together.\u00a0\r\nThrough mazes, fighting sceletons and\u00a0 finally the last piece of the soul will be theirs... But will their life energy last?\r\n</p>\n<p>The mysterious vendor keeps taking more of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T04:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/5668069239a38b5556ec0f8d7fd923c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RAC-Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
