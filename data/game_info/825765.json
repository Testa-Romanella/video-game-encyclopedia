{"id": 825765, "slug": "mouse-2", "name": "Mouse.", "name_original": "Mouse.", "description": "<p>A rage game where you use your mouse to dodge a LOT of bullets from different bosses. Space to use activated skills. To get an S rank, you need to find a black dot on a level, click it, and then beat the boss without taking a hit. To get a P rank, you have to figure it out! Heavily based on Studio MDHR's Cuphead. The game will take a little while longer than usual after an update.
