Watch out \n      for the spikes, touching the top of those or causing the square to lag \n      behind will result in a game over!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe765ff9fa634a08db5ea88e85ff5ca.jpg", "website": "http://www.cubeshift.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["Jace Voracek"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Jace Voracek"], "esrb_rating": null}
