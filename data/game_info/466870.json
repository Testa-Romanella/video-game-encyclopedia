The problem is there is no direct control over the AI. You can ask it to do high level tasks such as optimize your production and he might recycle the leftover materials, or remove the glue from the stamps to save on manufacture cost.</p>\n<p>The game fits the theme in two ways. The first is of course the lack of control the player has on the AI he is tasked with controlling. The second <spoilers> is that the AI slowly gets out of control and interprets the players commands in a more and more \u00a0horrific way, leading to the destruction of the world.<br/></spoilers></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:19:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cfa047ba0806caf08ff5f3c8e0671ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Barelos"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
