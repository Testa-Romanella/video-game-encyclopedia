The Knight's Guard have been tasked to head towards these locations and find and defeat the Generals. Once done, the area will be free and liberated from their rule.</p>\n<p>Knight's Guard is a fully 3D survival multiplayer game. Play alone, or team up with up to 3 friends and defeat the onslaught of enemies coming towards you. The longer you survive the tougher the enemies will become. You can purchase various weapons to help you survive, but your greatest aid will be Boosters and Breakers.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Boosters give you an enhancement in certain abilities: from coming back from a fall, increasing your overall health, to summoning minions to help you out, these powers will surely turn the tide in your favor. You can purchase them anytime, and as many as you want but after 4 the price begins to increase. Choose wisely on which ones you'll pick first.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you fall you'll lose all the ones you have purchased.</p>\n\n\n<p>Breakers will let you pass your limits. There are four types of Breakers: Speed/Power/Magic/Balanced, each come with their benefits and\u00a0\u00a0downfalls. While Speed Breaker will increase your speed greatly, you'll lose your overall health in the process. These abilities are temporary and can only be used for a short period before needing a cooldown.\u00a0Activate these whenever your in a pinch. You can only control one Breaker at a time.</p>\n<p>Combine Boosters and Breakers to truly max out your potential. With so many possible combinations every replay can have you playing a different style.</p>\n\n\n<p>Xbox/Gamepad have the same layout.</p>\n<p>Keyboard Layout (*Bindable Keys Coming Later*)</p>\r\nWASDPlayer MoveMouse\u00a0Camera MovementEnterPauseFInteractQActivate Perk* (If applicable)EActivate ScrollRActivate BreakerShiftRunSpaceJumpMiddle Mouse Click\u00a0 / GThrow GrenadeRight\u00a0Mouse ClickAim InLeft Mouse ClickLight AtkCHeavy AtkScroll Wheel / 1 KeyChange Weapon\r\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Knight's\u00a0Guard is still a very early work in progress.
