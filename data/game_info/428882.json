Using their newfound strength and wit, they armed themselves with human weapons of the finest calibur, and took control of the lands. Immortal beings of unrelenting horror, they cannot be killed with swords or even guns.<br />\nHowever, there is only one principle fact that rules these lands; \u201cThose who are flipped onto their shells, shall be cooked into a crab cake, or mouth-watering rangoon.\u201dYes,yes...Crabs who have embarrassingly been flipped over onto their shells will have no choice but to submit to the pot.<br />\nYou are a crab. Aiming to be the best around, you embark on a world tour to flip as many crabs as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-06T14:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a470e2c0c000cbf2615496ea4ee9c721.jpg", "website": "https://www.neoaq.net/games/fightcrab/", "rating": 3.7, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 23, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 588, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nussoft", "Nusso"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Playism"], "esrb_rating": null}
