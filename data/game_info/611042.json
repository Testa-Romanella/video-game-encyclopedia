I am not really sure how fun the game itself is so far, but I've had fun making it. Everything but the music was done by me, hence the terrible art. I don't have any sort of audience so I will be updating the game whenever I feel like I can.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of avoiding threats and discovering resources in an overworld dungeon in order to win turn-based monster fights. The monsters you collect and fight each have unique powers that can lead to interesting team compositions and playstyles on both the player's side and the enemy's. There will be at least five levels in the game, but right now the game ends after beating the second level.</p>\n<p>Things I will work on in the future:<br/>- Balancing combat and enemy AI<br/>- More locations<br/>- More monsters<br/>- More bosses<br/>- More room layouts<br/>- More risk-reward mechanics<br/>- More unlocks<br/>- UI and menu overhaul<br/>- Redrawing some sprites<br/>- Easy to use custom monster creator<br/>- Removing spaghetti code / improving the codebase / fixing bugs<br/>- Filtering out some of the inappropriate splash texts (there are about 40,000 possible splash texts, so that may take a while)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T06:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/6728e7780257d3043ec66bcc01ebdb45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ihitthesack"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
