The idea being you had to deal with dwindling power and air as you repaired your submersible.\u00a0 The game uses the darkness of the deep ocean to hide the monstrous fish of the deep. There is no end point to the game as it currently stands aside from death. However I am uploading it to gauge peoples thoughts on the atmosphere of the game. Constructive criticism is welcomed in the comments.</p>\n<p>Currently I am unsure what the future holds for this project, as the main 3D modeler who produced most of the 3D assets is unable to continue on the project. I would love to return to it but currently do not have 3D modeling skills.</p>\n<p>The ship seen in the main menu is Stylized Ship by\u00a0Headfinger in the Unity Asset Store.</p>\n<p>The models of the fish and tools created by\u00a0Luca Stephan Meierhofer.</p>\n<p>The audio soundscape created by EmSmith.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T03:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e50/e500893887dd65c2d9d57e578fc701ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Fluffy Dino"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
