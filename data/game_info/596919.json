You know it\u2019s full of goodies, but there\u2019s a reason for its eerie emptiness. The local miners say anybody who goes inside is driven mad, but that superstitious nonsense is just what you need to make your big break!\r\n</p>\n<p>Go deeper into the caves to find better ores, and when you\u2019re satisfied with your hall go back the way you came (exiting the part you\u2019re currently in is enough to finish). Don\u2019t stay too long though, there may be something to those rumors\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay -</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to build up the highest score without being too greedy and losing it all. You get a higher score by gathering more ore fragments, with deeper and less common ores giving you more points. Just walk up to them and give them a few whacks by clicking in their direction and the fragments will start pouring out.\r\n</p>\n<p>Gradually you will start losing your sanity, and strange hallucinations will appear around you. Getting near them will drain your sanity even faster, and your only salvation is to seek out more light, however even that will reach its limits when you\u2019ve been in the caves long enough. Before falling into the deep pit of madness, make your way back to where you entered the cave to save your loot and achieve your high score.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls -</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WASD - movement\r\n</p>\n<p>Mouse - aiming\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Click - Use pickaxe\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/821/82162390b098354df106566b178f81c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kovi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
