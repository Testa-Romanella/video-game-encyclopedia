Additionally this app let's me make it so that I\u00a0never have to play<em> that one</em> character again.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>Random vs Playlist setting. Smash Bros Ultimate default to Playlist mode, which means that if you're playing Random then it won't pick a character again until you've played all other characters first. True Random means you can get the same character 5 times in a row, because random.\u00a0Additionally I believe that random in Smash currently favors characters you play the least, whereas this app should be truly select randomly.</p>\n<p>Squad Strike Random: Create a playlist for 3 player and 5 player Squad Strike.</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0I OWN NONE OF THE ART ASSETS FOR THESE CHARACTERS! Please do not re-distribute for money</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T05:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24b/24b82a96ef95794dba5ff542633a2127.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Burlin-Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
