All assets (except for sound, credited)\u00a0and code were made by me over the course of the weekend, per the game jam's rules. It was my first, and even though there's still not a lot of \"game\" there to speak of, it was so fun seeing what I could pump out in such a condensed period of time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T05:24:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f0b205626ddf3b11928a99472935523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alannabean"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
