Originally titled Ikari (\u6012, &quot;Fury&quot;) in Japan, Ikari Warriors was SNK&#39;s first major breakthrough US release. The game was released at the time when there were many Commando clones on the market. What distinguished Ikari Warriors were rotary joysticks and a two-player mode.<br />\nThe player characters in Ikari Warriors are Colonel Ralf and Second Lieutenant Clark of the later King of Fighters series (known outside Japan as Paul and Vince in the Ikari series) battling through hordes of enemies. According to designer Keiko Iju, the game was inspired by the popular Rambo films and takes its name from the Japanese title of Rambo: First Blood Part II (Rambo: Ikari no Dasshutsu or &quot;The Furious Escape&quot;). Ralf and Clark also make an appearance as playable characters in Metal Slug 6 and Metal Slug 7, as well as the King of Fighters series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-13T09:25:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e9d/e9d2b6f855998ee10cb60ff859b61f06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 14, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 358, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "NES", "Atari ST", "Atari 7800", "Atari 2600", "PlayStation 3", "PC", "PSP"], "developers": ["SNK", "Micronics"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Tradewest"], "esrb_rating": null}
