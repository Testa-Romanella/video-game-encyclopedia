Hold right trigger to lock-on, press A to blast, use the left stick to move!<br/></p>\n<p>This is a short, early <strong>pre-alpha </strong>dreamcast demo! It's missing all kinds of stuff, there's some minor bugs and gameplay isn't even slightly balanced. If you'd like to see this developed further, give me your feedback on twitter or in the comments below.</p>\n<p>To play this you need to run it on a real Dreamcast console or use an emulator. (Region free, VGA only, controller needs to be in port 1. No dual stick support.)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T13:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97a/97a0c4c62060811d40c11eb03d3b9c85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["voxel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
