When you have no burgers left in your inventory, this will push clients away.</p>\n<p>Move with WASD or the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Bump into the burgerstand to refill your ammo.</p>\n<p>Bumping into yellow plus signs will upgrade the statistic next to them.</p>\n<p>Angry clients spawn for 10 seconds. When the timer hits 0, you can get an upgrade. Taking the upgrade starts the next wave. It is recommended but not nenecessary to get rid of all clients before collecting an upgrade.</p>\n<p>Getting hit by a client kills you.</p>\n<p>When the clients hit the burger stand, they take 5 times the burgers you cook per second.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Xargen: Shoe, spatula, burger, humans.</p>\n<p>ANIMPIC: Stand, grass, road, stones, sidewalk</p>\n<p>RedEarth: Death soundtrack</p>\n<p>fusehive: Upgrades available sound</p>\n<p>estudiocafofo: Upgrade sound, burger refill sound, stand sound</p>\n<p>ThiSound: Main soundtrack</p>\n<p>AlbertFernandez: Burger sound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T14:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/250/250ac010a504aa4b42815cdb6213debc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xargen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
