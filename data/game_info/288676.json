This is the <strong>most realistic top-down 2D racer ever...</strong> and then we smashed it up into a bizarre party game.  We provide a physics playground with sim-like cars, minimal rules (at the start), and you decide what to do with it.Whaaaaat???<br/>Old school gets a new-school makeover with more destructible physics objects than you can shake a two-dimensional polygon at.  And, oh, the skids marks!  Did we mention the oddly-satisfying skid marks that dirty up the track like never before?  And the dirt doesn't end there.  With debris everywhere from lost wheels, broken cars, various track objects, and up to 8 players on one screen generally making a mess of it all, just getting to the finish line can be a friend-testing brawl of gasoline-fueled tenacity.<br/><br/>Welcome to the petrolpunk world of Globetrotter Racing where it's 1975, The Great War was the only great war, microelectronics do not exist... probably because no one cared about going small after Nikola Tesla and his descendants learned to harness the power of lightning\u2014to put it simply\u2014and invented the Tesla Shield\u2122 for use in automotive safety and generalized pedestrian protection (GPP).<br/><br/>GRITS Racing is a game for the whole family and if somebody isn't laughing, giggling, snickering, or snorting most of the game... we aren't doing our job correctly.Features<br/>Wacky 2D car physics:<br/><br/><ul><li>Car body and wheels modeled separately<br/></li><li>4-wheel drive<br/></li><li>4-wheel steering (rear steering tapers off at speed)<br/></li><li>4-speed transmission (plus reverse) modeled on a torque curve<br/></li><li>430 ft-lbs (582 N-m) of engine torque (subject to change)<br/></li><li>Hand brake for the rear wheels<br/></li><li>Breakable wheel fasteners!<br/>(What is it like to drive on 3 wheels and 1 stub?

So, in desperation, he was looking about his pit area for a new idea to fix it when he spied his leftover pancake batter from breakfast.  He thought \u201cIt couldn't possibly be any worse, could it?\u201d  Well, actually, yes, it was worse.  Much worse.  But the crowd loved the results and the rest is lost in history.  No one remembers for sure who this racer was but legend has it he was called Juan Tabo.  Official records proving the existence of Jaun Tabo have yet to be found but this hasn't stopped governments from naming libraries and schools in his honor.<br/><br/>The sport, then known as Wheel Wiggle Wacing, languished in the backwoods of the Southern United States for years before Gilded-Age billionaire, Billy Bub Worcestershire, bought the rights to it and turned it into the mid-budget international sport known as Globetrotter Racing.  Mr. Worcestershire had previously made his fortune with the invention and popularization of deep-fried grits biscuits and, as he stated it, \u201cI understand food batter and believe in the future of all its lucrative properties.\u201d  Deep-fried grits also became the sport's official snack food.  When the Tesla's later invented the personal plasma energy shield (PPES), or Tesla Sheild\u2122, Mr. Worcestershire incorporated these shields into Globetrotter Racing and this variant, coincidently, became known as GRITS (Globetrotter Racing Incorporated, \u00e1 la Tesla Shields).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e8/9e868346d02fa149041ef4c1b37db34c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Muddy Desert"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Muddy Desert"], "esrb_rating": null}
