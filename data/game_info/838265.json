You control the gun, while Cubey will try its best to avoid the monsters. Safety not guaranteed.\r\nBeware... Cubey might be smart enough to avoid monsters, but is definitely not trained to avoid the deathly pools of lava.\r\nShoot monsters (using your\u00a0mouse)\u00a0and steer away from lava by using the recoil of your gun!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n<p>This game was made by Samuwhale and Nalloenoe for the Wowie Game Jam 4, where the theme was 'collaboration with AI'.</p><p>(Note: WebGL version might run slow.
