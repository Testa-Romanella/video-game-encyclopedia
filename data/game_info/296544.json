Evil forces have stolen the magical Book of Spells, making it impossible for civilians to practice magic. But all is not lost! With your special powers, you can sneak into the evil lair, find the Book, and return magic back to MagicLand.</p>\n<p>Your character has two forms: Rogue and Brute. As the Rouge, you can use magic spells to deceive and sneak past enemies. The Brute is less agile, but can use his attacking skills to defeat enemies in his way. </p>\n<p>However, be careful, as your spells are limited! You must pick up spell icons to gain spell abilities.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A and D or arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>W, space or up arrow to jump</p>\n<p>Q to switch between character forms</p>\n<p>Esc to pause/restart </p>\n<p>As the Rogue:</p>\n<p>E to spawn a duplicate (distracts enemies)</p>\n<p>Right click to place teleport, left click to teleport (cannot teleport through walls)</p>\n<p>F to go invisible (enemies will not detect you)</p>\n<p>As the Brute: </p>\n<p>E to smash nearby enemies</p>\n<p>Left-click to fire fireballs </p>\n<p>There are three types of enemies:</p>\n<p>Sentries don\u2019t move, but they are always on the lookout! Their lasers will fry you to bits. Don\u2019t move in their line of sight as the rouge, or be prepared for a quick death! </p>\n<p>Goblins fire energy balls from their massive stomachs. Need I say more? </p>\n<p>Ghouls move back and forth to patrol large areas. Don\u2019t get too close, because they bite! </p>\n<p>That\u2019s all!
