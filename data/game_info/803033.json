After running away from home, you find yourself trapped in the city of canine workers who built your empire. Should anyone find out your identity, you'll surely be killed.</p>\n<p>This is a project I've been working on for a while. I have so much more planned for it too, but right now I at least have this to show you all! This will be my first big project with visual novels. I'm working on it as much as I can, though I am a mostly one man team. Please be patient. (A lot of the elements of the game are open to changing as the game is developed. This is not representative of the final product.)<br/><br/>The character art was drawn by my amazing friend:\u00a0https://twitter.com/lloyd6675</p>\n<p>To support me and this project, please consider donating to my Patreon! Here you'll be given updates on the game as they progress as well as bonus sketches and polls to help decide things for the project! Anything you can spare would be huge in helping me spend more time working on it.\u00a0<br/>https://www.patreon.com/needs_bear</p>\n<p>Can't donate?\u00a0That's totally ok! When the game is finished, it will be released to the public for free. If you want to support me without donating, consider following me on Twitter.\u00a0https://twitter.com/needs_bear</p>\n<p>Thank you again for showing interest!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T12:50:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15a/15aa87d575f87a188778e847676738dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Needs_Bear"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
