In pursuit of Casterora, leader of a \n      huge syndicate that has escaped from New York to Osaka, the protagonists \n      are three detectives\u2014Duke, Ryu, and Billy. Each character fights using a \n      combination of punches, kicks, and jumps, and his own particular special \n      move, activated by simultaneously pressing the jump and attack buttons. \n      These lethal techniques have enormous destructive force, but they also \n      consume a great deal of energy. For this reason, players must use their \n      special moves with skillful timing. Luckily for the detectives, new \n      weapons and additional health can be found by breaking things like phone \n      booths and street signs along the way. A boss, who must be defeated in \n      order to continue the mission, awaits at the end of each stage. You can \n      also take on the gang with a friend, but beware that the attacks by one \n      player can damage the other\u2014so keep an eye on where your partner is in \n      the heat of the battle. End Casterora\u2019s reign of terror once and for all!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
