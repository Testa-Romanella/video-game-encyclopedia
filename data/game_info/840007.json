Unfortunately, they lost the key to their chest, so you have to get it for them. Their house is very secure and you will need to find some other items they may have lying around in order to get to the key and receive your prize!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Movement - WASD or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Menu Controls - Mouse Left Click</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing our game! This was for the Kenney Jam in August 2022 and was made in 48 hours with the theme of Growth. We have a small size changing mechanic along with the growth of your supplies as you go through the hoarders house. I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T11:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c16/c16bb1dfd3dc7149d543dfe39b2e8c34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Scooters"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
