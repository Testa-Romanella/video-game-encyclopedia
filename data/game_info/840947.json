The combat system emphasizes fluidity and experimentation and is best represented in the ability of the player to switch between weapons, and elemental modes, on the fly -- even in the midst of combat! Weapons can further be upgraded multiple times to increase their damage and unlock powerful new combos by collecting special items. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>Skill Tree : The game is all about defeating enemies in style, so unlocking all the skills, abilities, and moves is going to be a top priority. There are dozens of moves and combos to buy and more are unlocked as the player progresses through the story.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>Spells/Abilities : Mira and the Legend of the Djinns will feature some unique Spells and Abilities, we always wanted to see in a Metroidvania. A lot of magical abilities and spells have uses outside of combat, encouraging players to experiment.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>Tools &amp; Items : Seven tools can be aquired throughout the game. The player can use these tools to overcome obstacles, while exploring, solving puzzles and during combat. Various items will also be available to the player (including classics like health potions and bombs). Certain items are more rare and can be acquired by doing side quests, defeating certain enemies, and occasionally in shops.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T06:45:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af0/af0644c4a943fd3c8162e5e8e0e1ea5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 447, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["littleknightgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Assemble Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
