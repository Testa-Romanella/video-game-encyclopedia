For this project, we initially\u00a0modeled the solar system simply using the sun as a center, and then adding the Earth and the Moon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After these base elements, we were able to add more modifications of our choices. I chose to simulate the first couple planets in solar system besides Earth, which consisted of Mercury, Venus, and Mars. In addition to these three planets, I also included Mars' twin moons, Phobos and Deimos, which rotate around Mars.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>This project was created by Carter Brown for CAS 117. It was\u00a0completed using course provided assets, including textures, sounds, and scripts.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T08:14:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/2108fbdc6cd7b95d95140798e6e57656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gcbg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
