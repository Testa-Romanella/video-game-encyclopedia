{"id": 837499, "slug": "cruelfish", "name": "CruelFish", "name_original": "CruelFish", "description": "<p>There are fish swimming in the aquarium. Each fish has the following innate parameters:</p>\n<p>1) The maximum number of health points. Determines the maximum size of the fish.</p>\n<p>2) Protection. Determines the strength of its scales. The higher the defense, the less damage the fish receives when attacking it, but the heavier the scales.</p>\n<p>3) Attack power. Determines how much damage the fish does in one bite.</p>\n<p>The bite takes away a certain amount of health points from the target of the attack, and passes it to the fish. The bite force depends on the number</p>\n<p>of attack points of the fish, and its current size.</p>\n<p>4) Field of view. The fish perceives only one object closest to it at a time. The field of view</p>\n<p>determines the maximum distance at which the fish is able to perceive.</p>\n<p>5) The speed of movement at rest. The speed at which the fish moves, if there are no objects in its field of vision for perception,</p>\n<p>or these objects are indifferent to it.</p>\n<p>6) The speed of movement in the active state. The speed at which a fish moves, attacking an object that has fallen into its field of view,</p>\n<p>or escaping from it.</p>\n<p>Also, when moving, the fish always spends health points. The amount of spending depends on the current speed of movement, the size of the fish,</p>\n<p>slightly from its field of view, and the severity of its scales.</p>\n<p>7) The percentage of separation. By eating food, a fish, if it is viable, accumulates health points faster than it spends them. When the accumulated</p>\n<p>number of health points equals the maximum possible for this fish, a descendant will bud off from it. The percentage of separation</p>\n<p>determines how many health points will be transferred to the descendant, and how many fish will keep for themselves.</p>\n<p>8) The value system. Each fish has a tendency to one or another behavior in relation to the nearest perceived object.</p>\n<p>The fish can ignore it, continuing the previously started action, attack, or go on the run when it is perceived.</p>\n<p>The actions of the fish are determined by the color of the perceived object, as well as its relation to this color.</p>\n<p>Mutation: Every time a fish is budded, its descendant inherits its innate parameters, but one of the parameters</p>\n<p>changes slightly up or down. In case the mutation makes the descendant less adapted to the current conditions</p>\n<p>aquarium, he will have less chance to survive and give offspring. Otherwise, the chances will increase. This is</p>\n<p>how natural selection and the gradual evolution of fish dynasties take place. Also, the descendant inherits the name of the ancestor fish, allowing you to track</p>\n<p>the dynasties. By clicking on the fish with the right mouse button and selecting the \"show information\" item in the window that appears, the player can find</p>\n<p>out the values of the parameters of the fish and its progenitor.</p>\n<p>Start of the game session: At the beginning of the game session, the original fish that should later give offspring appear at</p>\n<p>random points in the aquarium, and their parameters are randomly generated.</p>\n<p>Algae also appear in random places, visualized in the form of gray circles. Their color is chosen so that the</p>\n<p>average fish is most likely to cause a desire to attack the algae. In the future, new algae will</p>\n<p>grow next to the algae already available.</p>\n<p>Additional elements:</p>\n<p>by clicking the middle mouse button on an empty area of the aquarium, the player can create a toxic puddle and a wall.</p>\n<p>Wall: An insurmountable barrier in the way of fish and algae. It is useful for creating delimited sections of the aquarium.</p>\n<p>Toxic puddle: a section of the aquarium with configurable toxicity and the rate of change of toxicity.</p>\n<p>Setup: The player can adjust the size of the aquarium, the maximum number of fish, the initial number of progenitor fish at</p>\n<p>the beginning of the game session, the maximum amount of food, the nutritional value of each food unit, the flow rate. These</p>\n<p>parameters can be configured both at the beginning of the game session and in the process.</p>\n<p>There are no goals and objectives. The gameplay consists in observing the bizarre course of the evolution of electronic fish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:25:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/971/97115f8d4ae31db8f76ebf2145842825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gabrielfisher_666"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
