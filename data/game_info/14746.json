We decided to take the simple concept of \"I Can't Escape\" - a creepy, immersive, and expectation-challenging dungeon experience - and flesh it out into a full game while retaining the fundamental spirit of the original. I Can't Escape: Darkness is designed to invoke feelings of being lost and alone, encouraging player's imaginations to run wild while providing subtle hints of terror (rather than in-your-face savagery). What will you see and hear in the Darkness? Unpleasant things which we - the developers - intentionally placed, or terrors from your own imagination?<br/><br/> Reaction compilation for the original I Can\u2019t Escape (click to play)", "metacritic": 40, "released": "2015-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07c/07cda12a93855cbe33a48ea7d1513c89.jpg", "website": "http://icantescape.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 57, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fancy Fish Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fancy Fish Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
