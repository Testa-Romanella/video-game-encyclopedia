That is if you go off the left side, you show up on the right. The catch? After reaching your objective the screen may move (or resize), forcing you to use the same environment in different ways.!\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls are left/right arrows to move and 'Z' to jump.</p>\n<p>Audio is not my own, it was found on https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-sound-effect-pack-vol-001. Credit to '@Shades'.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make something great for this competition. I never really publish any of the games I make because I never feel they are polished enough, and I know for certain this one isnt (or even complete). This resulted in me not really settling on an idea until earlier today/late last night, which is when I started this project. I decided to force myself to release the project regardless of whether I felt it was ready, because otherwise I never end up releasing anything.</p>\n<p>Thank you to anyone who gives my game a try, and any feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:43:52", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShazzyZang"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
