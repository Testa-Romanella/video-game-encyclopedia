Along the way to your eternal rest, you must dodge and escape from the demons who want to poke you with their tridents and drag you to Hell. It's very simple, really.</p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs and issues:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>No sound or music.</li><li>Sometimes the character's animation will stop in place. Moving or jumping a bit on a solid surface fixes this.</li><li>Sometimes moving cloud platforms don't carry the player character along and he falls. If this happens, try moving with the cloud.</li><li>The buttons on the pause menu don't work on the second level, but you can still resume the game by pressing ESC again.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T18:04:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ae/5ae26ae6e3acc9627a1f37c12b25a4f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gorila Azul"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
