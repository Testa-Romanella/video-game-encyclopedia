You must simply explore the world in search of 12 randomly placed Gems to power a portal and escape.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you are familiar with my Dragon Dreams game series, this is kind of a super-simplified spin-off.<br/>I woke one day wanting to make a simple little collect-a-thon, and it ended up slightly resembling Dragon Dreams, both in appearance and gameplay, so I figured I may as well just go ahead and let it share the name!\r\n</p>\n<p>It takes around 5-10 minutes to beat. Though it does have a couple stages of New Game+, in which things are more shuffled about randomly, to add a little replayability!</p>\n<p>Thank you for interest in this game, and for reading this!<br/>I hope you enjoy your time with Dragon Mini-Dreams!<br/></p>\n<p>(Figured it was about time I uploaded this one to itch. Made it back in 2020, and had kinda forgotten about it.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T08:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f671b37550f9a9bf2c062384f3580b73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piece of Pie Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
