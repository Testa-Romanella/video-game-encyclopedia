The theme was <strong>Seaside</strong> with the limitation <strong>\"Everything Must Die in One Hit\"</strong>.<br/><br/>In this game you float around as the Rainbow Fish, collecting smaller fish to create a swarm that can scare off even the scariest of predators!\u00a0<br/><br/>For this project I wanted to focus on having to create atmosphere and mood, as it is where my skill set is very lacking. With the Boid like fish, calm waters, and chill music I added a Zen mode for anyone who just wants to swim around and enjoy it. Was also a good excuse to work in UE5 :)<br/><br/>Was a lot of fun and looking forward to some more jams. Definitely wish I had time to implement the Octopus boss I was planning but management is a part of the jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T05:13:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e2/7e22773d61c5e2acc27c305a4a9fdce7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PonPonSmite"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
