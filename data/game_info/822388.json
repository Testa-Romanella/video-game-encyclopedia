Right now the game can only be played in split screen with another player and also lacks a lot of polish and interactability.<br/>I'm commited to build the project once again from the ground-up\u00a0after the GMTK 2022 game jam. I would also like to add a\u00a0story mode. It will be short but cryptic and creepy.</p>\n<p>To play it is required a mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T15:46:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/717/7179b2b641722810a41e540d03482cbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Saidrog"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
