You can bake treats, decorate cakes, and basically do whatever you want. Your kitchen has a wide variety of tools and ingredients from sprinkles, piping bags, and flamethrowers. The room also includes a large selection of multiple sprinkle colors and many ovens. You can grab one of the four cake types: loaves, bundts, cupcakes, and regular cakes and cook them inside of the oven. The cakes all have different cooking temperatures and times. Cook with caution as cooking cakes for extended periods of time could cause them to burn. You can also use the piping bag and color pipettes to apply frosting onto four different kinds of cakes. The frosting will then stick on the cake and allow for the cake to be transported. Sprinkles can then be shaken over the cake to add more decoration to the cake. The game is currently in early access and more tools and ingredients are planned and will be added in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T09:07:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c7/1c7d54ead8093dec59ca4b306157e4f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coolboi_21"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
