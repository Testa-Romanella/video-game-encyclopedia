It was going to be somewhat autobiographical but now it is super not. Explore the old hills, let memories come back to you, and leave when you're ready. You won't be back.</p>\n<p>WASD to walk around. Shift to run. <em><strong>Hold </strong></em>left mouse to interact with things. Escape to close the game if need be. You can only see each message once. Interact with the car when you're ready to go.</p>\n<p>By Avery Campbell.</p>\n<p>The music samples Jimmy Jewel and Hey, Black Sunshine by The Knit Separates.
