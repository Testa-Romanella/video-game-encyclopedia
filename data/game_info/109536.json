At the beginning of each turn, you draw a hand of cards from your deck. Many cards can be played together in a single turn, allowing you to form combination attacks and unlock special moves. As the game progresses, you will be able to expand the variety of cards at your disposal to unleash more varied and powerful attacks.</p>Card Combos<p>\r\n\tEach card has colored tags on its edges indicating which other cards it's compatible with. If a tag on the right-hand side of a card matches a tag on the left-hand side of another card, those cards can be played in sequence. i.e. If you can line up the tags on two cards by placing them side by side, then they can form a combo!</p><p>\n</p>Attack Types<p>\r\n\tBasic attacks are either physical (blue cards) or verbal (green). Physical attacks reduce your opponent's health, while verbal attacks reduce their morale. Draining either of these to zero will defeat your opponent, and any character with weakened morale will be less effective in combat overall. There are some special moves which can deal damage to BOTH stats as well! Finally, Boasts will restore or increase the user's morale. Health cannot be restored during combat.</p>Special Moves<p>\r\n\tSpecial Moves can be employed by playing specific card combinations. If the cards you have currently selected combine into a special move, you should see a bit of text pop up to let you know. Special Moves are always more effective than the sum of their parts, so it's a good idea to keep your eye out for special combos!</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\r\n  To the extent possible under law, the person who associated CC0 with this work has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this work.</p>Bonus Behind-the-Scenes shot from the character artist!<p>\n<br/>\r\nWe decided to take the theme a bit literally...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72a/72a60760d16eddc8824e8159e86c8217.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["noir"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
