You have only the most primitive technology on the boat and a mysterious radio contact called Marsha to guide you.\u00a0How far can you get using just your ears to navigate? And who is Marsha?</p>\n<p>What people aren't saying about this game:</p>\r\n\r\nThe game no one was looking for!\r\n<br/><br/>My screen is blank, 1 star.\r\n<br/><br/>A real ear-opener!\r\n<br/><br/>I don't know what they see in this game.\r\n<br/><br/>The only fad that was never popular.\r\n<br/><br/>Hmm... I don't like the sound of that.\r\n\r\n<p>Note</p>\n<p>This is my submission for GitHub Game Off 2021, and in that spirit\u00a0here is the code. It is somewhat of a crazy experiment, but hope there's some fun hiding in there somewhere.
