It's a simple 2D platformer with a twist: You're not a hero from the castle about to slay an evil dragon, you're a goblin cook working for the dragon! It starts slowly but things get more and more complicated as you go.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Story:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYour master has been robbed by a pesky rogue, and it's kind of your fault. Follow them through 5 different settings, from the dragon's lair in the Fiery temple of Doom, all the way to the Castle Keep, and return the stolen treasure! But beware, the closer you get to civilization, the more dangerous it becomes for a defenseless goblin.\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 35 levels filled with enemies, traps and secrets.</li>\n<li>Unique game mechanics for every world.</li>\n<li>World map - know where you're going!</li>\n<li>Two difficulty settings (casual &amp; old school). </li>\n<li>Ability to save &amp; continue later, for casual players.</li>\n<li>Keyboard (You can rebind the keys) and gamepad support.</li>\n<li>Cool music by Kevin MacLeod</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Steam:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Steam key included.</strong></li></ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Community:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>News (IndieDB) + follow on Facebook + Twitter + Forums</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/971/971713cf15fe631286e1b8eac8b80983.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nikola Bulj"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
