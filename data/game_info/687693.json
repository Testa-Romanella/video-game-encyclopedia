Don't hit the cars!<br/>There's no restart so you have to restart the whole game.<br/><br/>Someone got angry at the electric scooters left around the city. And for some reason he's got a tomato to throw around. Knock the pesky scooter drivers down but don't hit the cars!<br/><br/>A very quick and silly game made for the 0 hour game jam (with almost 0 gameplay as well, heh). Assets mainly from earlier personal projects except the tomato and scooter 3d models made in a pinch. One hour goes by so fast!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:08:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a22863d73a950879dc4fc85d13d756a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Irratium"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
