It definitely has some rough parts to it that I can recognize now as quite bad, but it has a lot of nostalgia for me.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In the game you play as Gompei the goat, mascot of WPI. He has been exposed to radiation from the nuclear reactor on campus and now has radioactive powers. The radiation has also created living things out of papers and reports that have now turned on the students. The students have been captured and locked in cages by the assignments and as Gompei you must destroy them and save the students.<br/></p>\n<p>The papers will spawn out of radioactive material piles that are destructible as well.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move.</li><li>Spacebar to shoot fireballs.</li></ul>\n<p>There are some copyrighted sounds and music in the game as it was a student project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa08a10afb390dc56bf3ad66a029c2cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hoodoo Wolf Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
