Will you keep under control those never tired units, endlessly spreading out all around the map?<br/><br/>It is said that online battles are all about skills...<br/> <strong>But what if battles are thrown into a time loop?</strong><br/>If you can fight back the same player in an infernal loop, will you learn to predict the events that have yet to happen? Will you study his weak point or improve your performance?<br/><br/>It is said that MMOs are all about socialising...<br/> <strong>But what about a world without a single ally?</strong><br/>Surrounded by 100s of opponents all looking for the same goal, will you circle or will you charge right into the crowd to find your path?<br/><br/>And by the way... <strong>how will you deal with a spherical battlefield?</strong><br/>Welcome to iubes world.iUBES:2<ul><li>iubes is a god game in real time strategy. A unique strategy gameplay in a quite unusual world...<br/></li><li>iubes are intelligent cubes: they gather resources, work, fight and defend by themselves, and have absolutely no interest in your micro management.<br/></li><li>22,907,635 iubes were killed in action during the first opus. They are now back with new units, new buildings and a new objective: making of your the new King.<br/></li><li>To control the iubes you have to understand their inner mechanics. Each of your command may affect the whole and utterly influence your timing.<br/></li><li>And because of the intrinsic nature of the iubes, this world is a never ending battlefield where every battle is perpetuated until defeated by another player.</li></ul>GOD-RTS?<br/>Basically, your goal is much like a classic RTS game: build your city, defend it, make soldiers, and ravage your enemy without mercy! But the way of doing this will be completely different than what you may be used to.<br/>The concept here is to focus on interactions between your iubes, your city, and above all time! A well timed plan is the key to everything...HOW TO PLAY?<br/>You can't control directly your iubes, they'll do... whatever they think they have to. You only decide what they must build, where and when. But this doesn't mean you can't control them! You simply cannot click and assign units. That is to say you have to manage your population by integrating your action into their own organization without unbalancing their workflow.<br/>Simple.CONSTRUCTIONS<br/>There is neither cost, nor stock needed before setting up a building. But think very well about the order and the location of your constructions. Since there is no fixed build time for constructions you'll discover that your choices can utterly influence the time taken to finish a building from a couple of seconds to minutes!FIGHT &amp; WIN<br/>Everything else follows : your buildings spawn fighting units which will start the war without asking any further question. So watch carefully and take the time it takes to understand the way everything works and how to improve your organization. A well placed building can reverse the whole situation!<br/>But seriously: always keep an eye on your iubes...ONLINE BATTLES<br/>Online battles are quite unusual. This is not a standard RTS where you simply play against your opponent, but rather a kind of instancing system:<br/>Each player is located on a map cell which carry the method and organization of its owner. When you play an opponent, you don't play him in real time, but you fight against a replay of his previous battle: in a way, his last successful strategy.<br/>Since the iubes don't need management, they'll keep the effectiveness and achieved velocity of their owner. Plus, the iubes never get tired.KING OF THE REALM<br/>You start on the edge of the world: target a surrounding opponent and defeat him to take his position whatever his colour is. Battle after battle, move forward to your targeted destination and collect the 4 banners all around the world. Of course you'll have to find your way between more experienced players.<br/>If you ever succeed in obtaining the 4 unique banners, you may try to reach the center of the map where the 5th banner will make you new king of the iubes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/022/022c814a194ac220558285b0b88159a6.jpg", "website": "http://codrer.com/iubes", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 455, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Codrer"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Codrer"], "esrb_rating": null}
