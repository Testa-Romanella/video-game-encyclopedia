It's definitely helped me find some shortcomings and confusions I'll need to address before going public with <em>Marv300</em>!</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As per the GGJ regulations the source must be published. It's here -\u00a0https://github.com/TheMightyGit/losttheplot-ggj21</p>\n<p>But you'd need the <em>Marv300</em> runtime to be able to use it, which is as yet unreleased.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T08:06:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d79/d79de0107acb3637fe4d1827bea39ff6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheMightyGit"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
