You'd be surprised at what you find!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Made in ~60 hours for GDL February 2018 Jam and FigJam. Themes are: Change of Perspective and Hidden Secrets respectively, so I made a game where you find hidden things (prohibited items) using something that changes your perspective (x-ray glasses).</em><br/></p>\n<p>Survive a week on the job of a security agent in the year 2025. Keep the threat level low by arresting passengers who are in possession of prohibited items. Don't let them leave the concourse. If the threat level maxes out, then all is lost. On the other hand, don't arrest the wrong passengers - you'll be fired after 3 false arrests.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\r\nMove - WASD or Arrow Keys<br/>Look Around - Move Mouse<br/>Jump - Spacebar<br/>Arrest - Left Click with reticle on a traveler<br/>Pause/Menu - Escape<br/>Cheat key to skip to next level - / (forward slash key)<br/>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>The humans in this game are procedurally generated and entirely random in skin color and gender spectrum, and entirely independent of who is in possession of prohibited items.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tools: </strong>Unity<strong>,</strong> Blender, Gimp, Substance Painter<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Third Party Attributions</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong>: Improbable by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) CC-BY 3.0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Items hidden on the travelers from Google Poly:</strong>\u00a0(CC-BY) Fish, Crawfish, Lighter, Hand Grenade, Bomb, Knife, Crayon, Butterfly, Coin, Hamster, Earthworm, Snake, Grasshopper, Nunchucks,Rubber Duck.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Icons:</strong> Baggage, Ground Transportation, Arrow by Niklas B\u00e4versten (CC-BY)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-27T21:47:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/593/59337d35afee6db0245a2f20f8d35c9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["andyman404"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
