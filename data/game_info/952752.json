It was meant to be a Training/Test but it turned out to be actually hard and fun to play. It has only 7 levels but it gets insanely hard.\u00a0 I was never able to finish Insane Mode, it's just too hard.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How do I play this?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Just use your arrow keys or W A D. Your player cannot move downwards so plan your movements! Everything kills you except the objective, a blinking block, and the exit. You must carry the objective to the exit to proceed to the next level. <strong>I recommend Casual Mode to learn the mechanics before you play normal mode.</strong> In normal mode, you get sent 1 level back if you lose all your 5 hearts.</p>\n<p><strong>Downloads<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I'll bundle the game to all platforms as soon as I am done with it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Where to play?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Play it in your browser here at itch.io or at https://hyper-tech.ch/Harald<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Feel free to suggest things I could add in the future!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T10:23:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/502/50274b672c3bc9a9e8356e55edb6f82f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ratzifutzi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
