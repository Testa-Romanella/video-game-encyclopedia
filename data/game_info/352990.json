As a player, you have four moves: up, down, right or left. With these moves, you shift gravity and slide the blocks alongside it. Your goal is to move blocks to their corresponding lit tile (and to hopefully, enjoy yourself). <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Contact me<br/></strong></p>\n<p>If you like this game (which I actually made a little while back but just never uploaded anywhere), please, send me feedback.
