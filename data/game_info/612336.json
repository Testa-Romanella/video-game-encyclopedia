No for real, it's my first time making an actual game,\u00a0if excluding those fan games I made when I was 10 with the Cartoon Network games generator.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The journey in completing this game\u00a0was stressful, tiring but I regret nothing. It was fun as hell, and I'm proud of it. Could do more with it and add more, but nah not right now.\u00a0 I love making it but there's something else that I wanna do. More games and stories to explore.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>STORY</strong></p>\n<p>Eliza is an orphan who was abandoned at birth by her parents. She grows up alongside her adopted sister Bailey\u00a0in an orphanage until one day they both decide to run away together. They were later picked up by a group of mercenaries called the \u2018Black Hands\u2019 and they took care of them and treat her like family.</p>\n<p>Few years passed by, Bailey told Eliza that she will be taking a quest at a town called \u201cGnajak\u201d because a traveler told her a handsome reward will be provided. Eliza advises Bailey that she wants to accompany her but Bailey refuses as she wants to use the reward to buy Eliza a birthday gift. Bailey ventures out but after a few days, she didn\u2019t come back. Worried for her sister, Eliza went off to Gnajak with her horse companion to search for Bailey.</p>\n<p>Shortly after arriving, a local told her that the town was peaceful earlier but was later overrun by strange unidentified creatures. She called them \u2018Splits\u2019 and told Eliza to be careful. Eliza runs towards the town and later faced the horrifying creature.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T07:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22b0dfc6812893fb1ab19d356ae8994c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["farasapt"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
