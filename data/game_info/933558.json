It was for the Extra Cedits Game Jam #6 and was made in under 48 hours. About a year after releasing it, I decided to take it down along with another game called 'HATRED' but I've now decided to reupload it and format the webpage to its original state as best as I can.</p><p>This game was made in 1 day and 6 hours for the Extra Credits Game Jam #6 with the theme of 'take care'. The game jam lasted 3 days but I started it late so if there are any bugs, then that's probably why. There's only two levels as I didn't have time to make more. Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD = Movement</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button = Shoot</p>\n<p>Don't let the viruses get to the heart!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T10:44:19", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["George Cranton"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
