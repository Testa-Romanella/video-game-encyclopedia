These can only be joined directly adjacent to other pieces, and have icons that hint to what you'll find in those tiles.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Action Phase</strong>: Move around the dungeon you've put together with your map, and encounter enemies and loot throughout. You will find items you can drag onto your equipment slots that will make you far more formidable in combat.</p>\n<p>3.<strong> Combat Phase</strong>: Once you enter an enemy tile, you will automatically engage them in a battle to the death. Only one will emerge alive.</p>\n<p>Quick Tips:</p>\n<p>- Press '<strong>Escape</strong>' to restart the game</p>\n<p>- If you can't place any more tiles, you must restart - you should have planned your route better! (... or it may be\u00a0a bug and we're sorry &lt;/3)</p>\n<p>- Equip items you win in combat or find in chests to keep yourself strong in combat.</p>\n<p><strong>- This game is not finished, as we ran out of time. The balancing is way off but we hope you can still have fun &lt;3</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0c6f1519e129799a78dd65318c00a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joe P.", "MarlyGames", "Vollando"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
