Only truly skilled knights can defeat him... Oh, and be careful of the fire pits and arrow traps!</p>\n\n\n<p>Bones 'n Riddles is my own game that I developed as a final project for my training. It's also my very first finished game.<br/></p>\n<p>I had about 4 months to complete it. From the idea to modeling,\u00a0texturing, animating, programming and creating the special effects, I did everything myself. It was chosen by the instructors as the best final project and I'm very proud of it<em>.</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Tip: Stand still and wait until the skeleton walks to you to attack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T07:34:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b0/6b062436239411d67f37f404b02218bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Celinart"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
