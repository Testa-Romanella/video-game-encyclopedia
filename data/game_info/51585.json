In this game you act as the personification of inspiration. Make your way through the shattered consciousness of the Storyteller who tries to write a new tale, and help him to succees with this goal. This poor fellow had to endure much - pangs of creativity and much worse things - and therefore his consciousness is unstable, tearing apart, haunted with internal demons. Is there a hope to save the light of mind in such unenviable conditions?Goal and controls[/ h2]<br/>To win, you have to pass through numerous levels of the Storyteller's mind. To move, press the mouse button, point in desired direction, drag the mouse in backward direction and then release the button, and the protagonist will jump in the desired direction. Be careful, though, as not precise aiming immediately leads to sorrofwul falling into the abyss.<br/>Also you should watch over the state of your inner fire. It fades away and decreases the area of light around you, and you have to collect sparks for maintaining brightness. Darkness is quite dangerous: not only you lose the sight of nearby platforms, suitable for jumping, but also you become quite vulnerable to the creatures, lurking in the dark!Game worldSeveral dozen levels, divided into different zones.Variations of endingYour playstyle will directly affect the story that the Storyteller will write. And his mental state as well!Covert backgroundFragments of memories, scattered throughout the levels, will help you to realize how the Storyteller has come to such a disheartening life.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43c/43c5089be4dba014bf8f29de6d7e7f30.jpg", "website": "http://wonderboxgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 28, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 30, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wonderbox Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wonderbox Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
