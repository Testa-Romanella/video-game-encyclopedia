It is inspired by the aggressive antics of eastern-European hooligans. It's a lot of fun to play with friends or even against bots (enter -&gt; /toggle bots).</p>\n<p>I still work on the game from time to time but I am mostly busy with school, life and other projects. There are a few weird bugs which are hard to fix, but the game is certainly playable and enjoyable despite them. Some of them even provide for some fun messing around, therefore they are officially \"features\" until they're fixed\u00a0(Also end of round is absolutely broken and is the work of Satan himself).</p>\n<p>If you have questions, feel free to join the discord server.
