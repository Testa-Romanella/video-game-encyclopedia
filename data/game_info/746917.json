{"id": 746917, "slug": "the-bird-effect", "name": "The Bird Effect", "name_original": "The Bird Effect", "description": "<p>The Bird Effect\u00a0is about playing as a bird, and it's my\u00a0<strong>first game</strong>. I think the most interesting part about games is tight and precise controls, so I tried to make a system of flying to facilitate that. The first part of this game is gathering collectibles and learning basic controls from an out-of-his-element penguin and an ugly bear.<br/></p>\n<p>Once you find the virtual world (<strong>it is not real</strong>), you can enter it. This is where the main content was supposed to come from but I never got to that part lol. Its a single level time trial obstacle course thing. The world with collectables in it is a premade asset, but the time trial was built by hand with Probuilder. It turned out pretty fun, but I ran out of time for more levels lol and a scoreboard. S<em>orry it sucks</em> &lt;3.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>:</p>\n<p>E: Talk</p>\n<p>LCLICK: Flap</p>\n<p>LCLICK (hold): Strong flap</p>\n<p>WASD: Control the flap direction</p>\n<p>RCLICK: Wing tuck to shrink hitbox and reduce drag</p>\n<p>SPACE: Jump from ground, slow fall when in the air</p>\n<p>P: Menu</p>\n\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong>:</p>\n<p>- A distinct lack of main menu (priorities lmao)</p>\n<p>- RigidBody physics based bird flight. Emphasis on game feel.</p>\n<p>- Basic sound effects, basic fx, animated bird character.</p>\n<p>- Small world with added collectibles and interactive NPCs. Basic missions included.</p>\n<p>- Custom Probuilder obstacle course/ race map with timer.</p>\n<p>- Killboxes, scene switching, pause menu, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ASSETS USED</strong>:</p>\n<p>- The parrot model: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/low-poly-bird-...</p>\n<p>- The Polygon Knights map: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/polygon-knights-lo...</p>\n<p>- Low poly animals: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/low-poly-animated-an...</p>\n<p>- Skyseries free: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-series-fr...</p>\n\n<p><strong>AFTERTHOUGHTS</strong></p>\n<p> After a horribly frantic week, I've released my first game!</p>\n<p> The theme \"it is not real\" was included in my original plan, but it barely appeared in the final version as the second world, the challenge room. That's of course because of time constraints lmao.</p>\n<p>There are some aspects that are buggy and unfinished but I consider it a good first try, considering the deadline.\u00a0I developed a bunch of different systems that were far more robust and flexible than they needed to be, so I know most of my work is reusable and reworkable code. As an experiment, I'd call it a success.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The specific systems I built include: NPC system; a mission system; a finite state machine character controller on a rigid body; soundmanager, scenemanager, cameracontroller. The UI is not expandable due to time constraints, and the collisionmanager is likewise. I'm tired.</p>\n<p>Now it's time for\u00a0sleep\u00a0zzz.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c12/c12544365b10fc820b0ae80c156765b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OldManSnickers"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
