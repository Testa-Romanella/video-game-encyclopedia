Making irrevocable choices in dialogue you shape the bond with him, which ultimately influences the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>As Riley puts it all together, she comes to understand how an island\u2019s history led to Josh\u2019 death.<br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Relationship exploration<br/></li><li>Environmental storytelling<br/></li><li>Emotional choices with consequences<br/></li><li>Branching narrative with multiple endings</li></ul><br/><h3>Relationship exploration</h3> is a unique feature that allows the player to make choices in a subtle immersive way. Often all one has, is the power of words. And it is your choice to reach out or to alienate. Like in real life, you don't always know how your words will affect the other. Or what future they hold.<h3>Emotional storytelling</h3> is something that we are both passionate and curious about. Players identify deeply with characters of flesh and blood that they can relate to. Through complex characters we\u00b4re able to tell stories that trigger a universal set of emotions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Created by like Charlie, the team behind the award-winning story exploration game Marie's Room.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-02T00:12:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/1478694ca535fb68fb54bfc97a75418c.jpg", "website": "https://www.likecharlie.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 17, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["like Charlie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Application Systems Heidelberg"], "esrb_rating": null}
