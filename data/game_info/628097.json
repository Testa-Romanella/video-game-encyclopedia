Unlock characters, collect discs, and perhaps even uncover secrets as you compete for top score across the leaderboards.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Single Player and Couch Coop</h3> Take control of both Frisbros or team up with friend to take on each course.  Every course is designed to be challenging yet comfortable for both the lone wolf and the seasoned dynamic duo.  Ranks are tracked individually between the two game modes.<h3>Unique Mechanics on Every Course</h3>Every Frisbro knows that each course has its own unique personality.  From throwing challenges to puzzlers to arena battlers, every course will keep you guessing what's coming next.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Unlockables Galore!</h3>Meet new Frisbros on the course eager to join your roster, collect discs snatched from prior bros by the wind, and play well to unlock emotes and celebrate masterful throws.<h3>Rating Systems, Leaderboards, and Game Modes</h3>Try to five star every level by not dropping the disc or compete across the leaderboards for the least strokes and fastest time.  Play casually or go hardcore and prevent respawns if your bro takes damage or goes out of bounds.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T03:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9c/a9ce02055bc404e08253917d4c20a51e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TheNevel", "Nicholas Evelson"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nicholas Evelson"], "esrb_rating": null}
