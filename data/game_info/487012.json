With no indication of where to go or what to do, you have no choice but to explore, solve puzzles, and try to find a way home.<br/><br/>Staying true to the Myst-vania genre, nothing in the game is outright explained to you; a big part of the game is about exploring, learning, and piecing together clues about what's going on and how everything works.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/16783b6968c5b726b27a6d5ff3ca2c53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tcordle"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
