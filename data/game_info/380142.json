Click on ship cells floating around and drag them to connect them to your ship anywhere. But be careful, enemy shots can hit cells hard enough to completely knock them off your ship! Destroy the enemies by shooting at them while simultaneously building up your ship from scratch.</p>\n<p>WASD, click and drag, space to shoot. Minimal effort put into art and sound, as this is mostly a proof of concept of how a modular physics-based shipbuilding game could work. Note that there is no exit condition, the game will run forever until you reload it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T07:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12cd2906946160d2068d3e828fcd4ac5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eeyle"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
