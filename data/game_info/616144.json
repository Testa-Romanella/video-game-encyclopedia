Simple controls, shoot the ball (a hunk of meat) by pressing space, and the closer you are, the stronger the hit. Thanks to Mister Mike and AI Sweigart for their assets from Zelda 1.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hold \"h\" to view the game's controls. Level select is as simple as pressing a number on your keyboard, starting at 1.\u00a0Go for the lowest par, or the fastest time.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy, and happy 35th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda!</p>\n<p>(Tip: Holding shift to crouch lowers your movement speed, which is very important to make precise shots.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:12:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a1efdfa9d1447d7eb18a0cf5e0f5ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gruz_Mother"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
