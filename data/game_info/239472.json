You and your zoo animal friends have escaped the bronx zoo life and must survive the rush of enemies out to stop you. The zoo craft zoo keeper left the zoo cage doors open by accident. Lucky for you this zoo builder left his lunch and forgot to lock the cages with his keys so some of the cute animals were on the run for free. This fun game is a great kid game and is an easy running game for the youngsters. Adults can play too! If you love farm games or farm animals you will love this game as well.
