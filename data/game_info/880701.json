But beware as things aren't as simple as they may seem. There are Viruses which can blow you up into smaller pieces making you prey for the cells around you. Once you recombine after a few seconds, you can chase cells that are smaller then you and push away any other Viruses by shooting mass!<br/></p>\n<p>Tips:<br/></p>\n<p>- Splitting can increase your movement speed</p>\n<p>- The more you split the longer it will take to recombine</p>\n<p>- Shoot mass into Viruses to push them away from you</p>\n<p>- You lose mass every second so keep moving</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: This game is in very early development, I'm posting it in hopes to get some traction before actual release. I encourage feedback and criticism!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T12:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d842961b16508905e361e1bef829376f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Superverra"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
