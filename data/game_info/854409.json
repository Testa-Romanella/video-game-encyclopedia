{"id": 854409, "slug": "areigna-tactics", "name": "Areigna Tactics", "name_original": "Areigna Tactics", "description": "Areigna Tactics is a top-down hex based strategy game taking place in the world of Areigna, a fantasy world of Humans, Goblins, Dwarfs, and much more. Play in this multiplayer real time strategy game online in ranked matches with people all around the world.<h3>Gameplay</h3>Unlike many strategy games which are based on resources held and build times, Areigna\u2019s gameplay and balance focuses instead on cooldowns. These cooldowns vary across different units, and their attack and movement. You will need to balance these cooldowns and constraints in your building of new units, as well in the actions you command your units making their way to the enemy nexus.<h3>Battle</h3>There are 3 unit types for you to build; infantry, ranged, and mounted. All these units are designed differently depending on the Faction you choose to play in the match. Although the attack values are not different, the units fall into a combat triangle: Infantry &gt; Mounted &gt; Ranged &gt; Infantry.<h3>Commanders</h3>Along with your choice of Faction to play in the match, you also pick an additional character to take into battle. Each Faction has their own uniquely designed Commander which provides you with passive and active abilities to help your core army.<h3>The Artifact </h3>The Artifact can be found in the middle of the map. It will spawn four minutes into the match. When the Artifact appears both players have one minute to capture and hold around it. The player with the most power at the end of the minute will receive a powerful buff to help them on their way to victory.<h3>Our Initial Journey</h3><br/>We have every intention to build Areigna up to be something that is enjoyable, competitive, and accessible to as many people as possible. The above roadmap is our initial plan to support the game for the rest of the year. For the rest of the roadmap into next year's development plans, check out our Roadmap on our website.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T04:55:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0a/c0ab4a68c2eaca6611e86fe782e48db0.jpg", "website": "https://areignatactics.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Hirschfield Software"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Hirschfield Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
