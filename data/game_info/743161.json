Any feedback and  suggestions are appreciated.\u00a0(But if you submit a bug report that is just a screenshot of the bug enemies I'll add you to the wall of shame for unfunny dummies)<br/></p>\n<p>This is a small demo that I'm hoping to eventually expand into a full game. I've been working on this for a while now and I'm finally ready to publish a playable demo. It's far from finished of course.
