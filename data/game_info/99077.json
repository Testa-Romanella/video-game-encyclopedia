Your ship is now slowly drowning to the depth. In order to escape you have to open the door and take the escape pod. Sadly you are <strong>blocked </strong>since the door is also broken, you'll have to collect <strong>block </strong>in order to repair it but be fast or you'll drown ! <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Controls<ul><li>Movement : <strong>Arrow keys</strong></li><li>Rotation : <strong>S</strong></li><li>Construction and Give energy :<strong> Z or C<br/></strong></li><li>Deconstruction : <strong>X</strong></li><li>Change Layer (Normal;Electricity;Water) : <strong>E</strong></li><li>Grab/Put Block &amp; Link : <strong>W</strong></li><li>Display/Hide information : <strong>F</strong></li><li>Display/Hide research : <strong>R</strong></li><li>UI controls :<ul><li>Previous / Next Selected Block : <strong>A / D</strong></li><li>Rotate Selected Block : <strong>Q</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>There are a lots of commands, but hey, it is a building game without mouse !<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Gameplay</li></ul>\n<p><em>It you feel strong enough or you have an adventurer soul, you can skip this part and learn by yourself.
