After spelling out your name on the letter board, you can tackle timed challenges in the room by shooting the correct answers when they appear on a blackboard. But first you'll need a gun... or a \"laser banana\"?</p>\n<p>The game features VR interactions, haptic feedback (controller vibration), thrilling sounds and music, plus a persistent high-score table to keep track of who pwned who!</p>\n<p><strong>DETAILS</strong></p>\n<p>After acquiring a laser pointer (gun, banana, whatever) you choose a challenge by <strong>tagging</strong> (shooting) an object in the room, for example the globe labelled \"Geography\".\u00a0This tagging action triggers a <strong>challenge</strong>.</p>\n<p>The main blackboards present a right and wrong answer, and you tag (shoot) one of them.\u00a0Each challenge lasts a fixed time (40 seconds), has three levels and rewards combos of correct answers. The challenges in the initial release\u00a0are:</p>\n<ul><li>Capital cities of the World</li><li>US Presidents and their dates of tenure</li><li>US States and their capital cities</li><li>Addition (&amp; subtraction), various levels including negative numbers.</li><li>Multiplication; 2 x 2\u00a0up to 12 x 12</li><li>Chemical elements and their symbols e.g. K = Potassium</li><li>Tennis \"Grand Slam\" winners</li></ul>\n<p>You can also play in practice mode where the correct answer is highlighted or written in bright yellow, but your score won't be recorded.</p>\n<p>If you want to reset all the high scores and start again, there's a button on the teacher's desk for that.</p>\n<p><strong>Exiting the game:</strong> You can just quit the app on the Quest, but if you prefer a less abrupt exit, shoot the paper cup by the rubbish bin (garbage) in the corner. It's clearly labeled.</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n<p>This game started out as a tech demo based around\u00a0\"flash cards\" for these separate challenges to help kids practice their addition, multiplication, etc...\u00a0There are some other interactions in the room as I experiment with VR.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What's with the name?</strong></em> There's something called the Sieve of Eratosthenes which is an algorithm for quickly finding prime numbers. I wanted to put that into this game; it didn't make it into this version but the name stuck. It's\u00a0<strong>Era-Toss-The-Knees.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT PLANS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Future plans:</strong>\u00a0This is really a test area for VR ideas and interactions. There's lots of potential for improvements... robots, more letters, maybe a spelling bee? Moving targets might be fun.\u00a0Or this may morph into a completely new game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Modding support:</strong>\u00a0This game is designed to be user-moddable; question sets are simple CSV files inside the project folder and on the PC it's easy to add a new set of questions. But on the Quest, mods don't seem to be supported. So this would be a feature in the SteamVR version.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Updates may include more platforms, more interaction options, etc.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>TECHNICAL</strong></p>\n<p>This project is un Unity 2020.1 (preview/non-production)\u00a0using exclusively the Unity XR Interactions Toolkit, no SteamVR or any other VR/interaction package.</p><p><strong>TEAM &amp; CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Bad Penny Games, contact email:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>itch</strong>\u00a0@\u00a0<strong>badpennygames.com</strong></li><li>\"Space Girl\" Artwork:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/fan_art_lexy/</li><li>Voice Talent: Michelle Ticktin</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:49:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59d/59dd3348d4c9d3ed7928f05fbe7bb42c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["bad.penny.games"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
