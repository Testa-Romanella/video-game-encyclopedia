The four roles, the Queen, the Knight, the Bard, and the Gloom, all have unique skills that will ask you to sing, recite a poem, give meaning to a symbol, or inspire your fellow players with a quote in order to use your abilities. In addition to this, you will also be rolling dice (specifically a d20 and a d10). <em>The Queen of Light's Last Stand</em> also features beautiful public domain art by Alexander Rothaug and Viktor Vasnetsov, and numerous random tables to help inspire your play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T06:03:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/377/3776d63d1b626012716dc1ff8a9c59d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lantern Heart Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
