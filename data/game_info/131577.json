If she fails, she will never be rid of the curse and will eventually descend into the rabid madness which all werewolves eventually succumb to. The city, however, has been consumed by the flames of revolution, so our huntress must confront many dangers, both human and werewolf. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17a/17a168b0f2948e834e3783d313af8365.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Hall"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
