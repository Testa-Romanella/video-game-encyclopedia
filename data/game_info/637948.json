{"id": 637948, "slug": "battle-buttons", "name": "Battle Buttons", "name_original": "Battle Buttons", "description": "<p>Use WASD to walk around and move your mouse to turn your character.\u00a0Enemies walk towards you and turn red when you press their key(s). Kill them by touching them without pressing their key, but don't touch them while they're red. As levels get harder, different types of enemies are introduced. Can you beat all 40 levels? After level 40, there are auto-generated levels, which get harder as you beat more of them. The faster you complete the levels, the better score you get out of diamond, gold, bronze, and.. green. (Only in the first 20 levels, I couldn't be bothered to do the others). Esc to pause level.</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0Ben Mason</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T05:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/402/4029e9ab8efe38bbecd6a893a1f1790a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Quaccanthrope"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
