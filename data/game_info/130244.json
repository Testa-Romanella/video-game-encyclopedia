Shoot the bad guys, they will drop stuff, which can be 'speed', 'health' or guns. On the first level, the only gun type they will drop is the \"Cap Gun\" which is not powerful but you can have 16 of them at once (the max. number is shown on the HUD). When you pick up a gun of the same type you have, you'll get an extra gun, but if it's another type, you'll lose all the guns you currently have.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAs the level increases, better weapons will appear, but you have to choose carefully which ones to pick. Even the low power \"Cap Gun\"' is good when you have 10+ of them. It fires slow projectiles though, so for the higher levels it's not very good. There are currently 7 different guns. The rarity is proportional to the level you are and the power of each gun.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAt start it's not very easy to control the ship as its quite slow to accelerate, but once you collect some 'speed' drops you'll get a very maneuverable ship in no time.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game is about dodging bullets more than firing them. If you just point and click at the enemies you're guaranteed to die soon. The enemies shoot in a pattern, so once you figure out how to maneuver properly it's easy to dodge their bullets. The best approach in combat is to dodge a few bullets when the enemies appear on screen and then shoot a little, rinse and repeat. Of course if there are tons of enemies together the best approach is \"divide and conquer\": run away and take one at time. They'll follow you no matter what, so don't worry about losing their positions.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/883/88314977a0dc7c6bf6f674939df50c5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlanGameDev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
