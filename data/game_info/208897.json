Came across it a while ago and although it might be a case of directing resources at the symptom rather than the disease, I have to admire such a simple idea that seems to work so well. (I did take a little bit of artistic liberty in not requiring it be tied down to a specific point by its electric cable, but a free-floating one of these isn't totally fantastical in fairness.)</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have been working on another game and it's not going to happen today, probably not even this week, despite being simple enough in theory. A lot of learning in this other one, and I'm sick, so I\u00a0decided to 'give myself a break' and 'only' crunch out something small in a few hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy simulating something that would help the world as you play this game! It's rare enough in games, really, but we all need our escapes as well.</p>\n<p>Lexaloffle BBS thread:\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>#1GAM December 2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca6/ca68cfc07d7af2adbe73ca4b5a056a0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
