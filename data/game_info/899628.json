Unfortunately the night is coming and something else seems to be out there is the snow.<br/></p>\n<p>I am a huge fan of RPG Maker Horror Games and wanted to try it. I would greatly appreciate any feedback.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Scavenge for firewood to keep a fire lit to avoid freezing to death.</li><li>Explore an seemingly abandoned cabin piecing together what happened there.</li></ul>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>The game should launch in the browser and can be played normally there. If this doesn't work or you want a download for other reasons just download the zip file, unzip it and launch the \"game\" exe file.</p>\r\nCredit:\r\n \r\nAssets Used\r\n \r\n<p>Sci-fi icons, used for fuel can. https://opengameart.org/content/sci-fi-goodscommodities .
