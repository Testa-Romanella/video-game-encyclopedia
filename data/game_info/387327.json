Help the animals by giving them different kinds of hints. Show them where the food or water is, find them a new home or select their prey. Help the animals procreate and save them from harm!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Explore different surroundings</h3>Play in one of six distinct environments, each being unique in terms of weather, plants and animals which are inhabiting them. Each ecosystem is different and will present you with new challenges and missions. Guide the wolves in European forests, save the penguins in Antarctica or command the lions in hot Africa - each biome is a new adventure to explore! <br/><br/><br/><h3>Show them how to survive</h3>Use your powers to teach the animals how to avoid harm! Direct them away from the streets, to make them avoid the traffic. Make them run away from hunters and save them from natural disasters. The animals will learn based on your actions - command them wisely as the balance in the ecosystem is fragile. Do not let them go extinct!<br/><br/><br/><h3>They need your help</h3>During gameplay, you will face many events - save the animals from human influence and disasters such as fires or droughts. You can lead the animals to extermination or bring balance and multiply their population. It all depends on you!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Watch their rituals</h3>Different animals mean different behaviour that you can observe, while they are mating, eating or even hunting. Watch them as their population grows, see how they behave and react, and teach them to avoid danger!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T02:43:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/0609b9b57d80265de714d726a6099cab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 19, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 46, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DreamStorm Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Games Operators"], "esrb_rating": null}
