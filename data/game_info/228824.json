Yes: 4 players on the same screen. It's so much Fun !!!<br/><br/>If you like to play with your friends, on the same game, at the same time, on the same device, you will just LOVE this game. Of course you can play alone against the computer but this game is even more fun with real players.<br/><br/>You are a sheep. A very cute sheep. There are 3 other cute sheep like you. The wolf... yes there is a wolf as in any story with sheeps..., turns his muzzle and you must jump over or block it. If you block it at the right time, it will go in the other direction. If you jump at the right time, it will continue until another sheep makes a block. If the muzzle touches you... you loose. <br/>The clock is running and the muzzle goes faster every second.<br/><br/>A very simple game but so addictive.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T13:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecdbd96ec1140d1c1e88ecfc5eecea73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Playtouch"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
