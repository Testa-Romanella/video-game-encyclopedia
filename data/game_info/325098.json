From the sweeping deserts of Libya to the mountainous Gothic Line in Northern Italy to the islands of Crete and Sicily, CMAK allows you to recreate some of the most fierce ground battles of World War Two. Combat Mission: Afrika Korps\u00a0 allows the player to lead the soldiers of ten nationalities including the USA, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Poland, and France into battle, using historical Tables of Equipment and Organization (TO&amp;E), surroundings, and combat results.<br/><br/>\nCombat is simulated in turns using science and behavioral logic, not \u201cgamey\u201d conventions such as hit points, armor ratings, tables of resolution, or other overly simplistic concepts.\u00a0 The pioneering \u201cWeGo\u201d gameplay system helps avoid many of the realism problems of other games by requiring both players to submit their orders and having them carried out simultaneously.\u00a0 The resulting 60 second replayable \u201cmovie\u201d can be viewed from any angle and perspective before moving onto the next turn.<br/><br/>\nPlay stand alone battles, connected battles, or \u201cQuick Battles\u201d created on-the-fly.\u00a0 The full featured Editor allows you to create your own battles.\u00a0 A large amount of community generated battles and Mods are available for free download.\u00a0 In addition to the very challenging single player mode, two people can play on one computer, TCP/IP network connection, or via PBEM.<br/><br/>\nApply common sense and intuition and don\u2019t expect \"gamey\" tactics to work - no matter how successful they were in other games. You will be forced to plan ahead, use timing, suppression fire, feints and flanking attacks to survive, let alone to win. When planning your moves, think about what would work in the real world, not what would work in other games.<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T21:08:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/704/704e0f7143ec7b181a6f4e302489c6ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 492, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Battlefront.com"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Battlefront.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
