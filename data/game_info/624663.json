That really forced me to re-think the concept, and allowed me to throw together a prototype incredibly quickly.\r\n</p>\n<p>It's not a particular long or spectacular game, but because of the feeling of redemption I had upon finishing it, I was very proud.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:57:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54c/54c0ec722d26c8552bf3093aea413b3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrayWingII"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
