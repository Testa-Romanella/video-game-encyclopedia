Not many people have bothered to spend weeks, months or even years to find Armadoge, but the ones who have came back were scared with dreadful memories of dangerous creatures who attempted to stop them in their paths. All of this didn't matter to Julian as he wasn't scared of anything! That's what he though anyway... Throughout his path he will face many death dangerous creatures while moving along the death defying landscape. Thankfully he has a Light Machine Gun to help fend off some of the monster who attack him. As he gets further, his weaponry and armor will become stronger, but the monsters will also become stronger. Does he find to city of Armadoge? That's for you to decide...\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Move Left = A/Left Arrow Key</li><li>Move Right = D/Right Arrow Key</li><li>Jump = Space bar/Up Arrow Key</li><li>Shoot = Left Mouse Button (LMB)</li><li>Restart = R</li><li>Pause = ESC</li></ul>\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n\r\nMinimum\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>CPU - 1.6 GHz Intel Pentium (AMD equivalent)</li><li>GPU - Intel Integrated Graphics 500 (1 GB Vram)</li><li>Storage - 10 MB</li><li>Ram - 2 GB</li><li>OS - Windows 7, 8 or 10</li><li>Architecture - x64</li></ul>\r\nRecommended\r\n<ul><li>CPU - 2\u00a0GHz i3 Intel Pentium (AMD equivalent)</li><li>GPU - Intel Integrated Graphics 500 (2 GB Vram)</li><li>Storage - 10 MB</li><li>Ram - 4 GB</li><li>OS - Windows 7, 8 or 10</li><li>Architecture - x64</li></ul>\n<p>All Rights Reserved - Spiral Galaxy Studios, Inc.
