You mission is to defend your island from pirate attack by bombing pirate ships. The optional custom hardware provides you with a \"power\" glove that vibrates when signal is lost to the leap motion controller. If you don't have a leap motion device, you can use a game pad or keyboard. <br/><br/>This is an experimental game that is trying out leap motion and custom DIY hardware. You would need to build your own custom hardware which would cost around $20 with full build details given. </p><p>Depending on how things go, it could be the start of something bigger :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5f/b5f9eb9053ea5ce452835cc65fe4766a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["funkinessfactor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
