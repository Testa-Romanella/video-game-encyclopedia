Enemies are dropped into the level in multiple waves, and the round ends when the programmer clears every wave.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T13:59:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db54226862b67da7204b2921bf2e053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
