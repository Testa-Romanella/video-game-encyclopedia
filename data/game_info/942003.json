You can also build up huge scores by completing larger and larger areas!<br/><br/>For most biomes, completing 4 whole regions unlocks another biome.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Every playthrough is different<br/></li><li> Enormous skill ceiling<br/></li><li> 2530 tiles to discover and collect<br/></li><li> 48 Steam achievements<br/></li><li> Time trials<br/></li><li> Daily challenges<br/></li><li> Unlockable extras<br/></li><li> Global Steam leaderboards for every game mode<br/></li><li> Over an hour of beautiful, uniquely relaxing original music by Mark Bondar<br/></li><li> Robust rank system to record and compare skill levels, from beginner to grandmaster<br/></li><li> Steam cloud support<br/></li><li> Multiple save slots</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T09:07:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bcf2199cf7c28aa111b53ae6caba4f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["supware", "Ben Emmerson"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ben Emmerson"], "esrb_rating": null}
