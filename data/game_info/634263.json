{"id": 634263, "slug": "freelancer-itch", "name": "FreeLancer (itch)", "name_original": "FreeLancer (itch)", "description": "<p>FreeLancer is the Free game in which you get to Free-lance your way through hordes of enemies while freely moving through the environment using your custom Gunlance.<br/></p>\n<p>As a FreeLancer living on the fringe mining planet Selah you make your living from Gigs you can pick up at the Bulletin Board. These will usually see you clearing some nuisance or pest from the various abandoned mines and mountain sides. Allowing the workers to continue their work is the top priority of the Council of Planets, and so FreeLancers such as yourself are required.\r\n </p>\n<p>Gigs come in a variety of difficulties. Make sure to not bite more than you can chew. As you complete more Gigs and your renown increases, so will the challenge of your gigs and their rewards.\r\n </p>\n<p>As you pick up missions and carve, shoot and dodge your way through enemies you\u2019ll gather coin to upgrade your equipment and abilities. Because of course, Freelancers don\u2019t work for free.\r\n </p>\n<p>You can move your FreeLancer using the A and D keys and aim your Gunlance freely with the mouse. Wherever you lance aims, you win.   </p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to use your Gunlance\u2019s signature bullets. Using these bullets you can take out enemies from afar and even raise yourself from the ground and maneuver through the air.   </p>\n<p>The armor of a FreeLancer is hefty and strudy so jumping is only possible using the powerful kickback of your Gunlance. Aim in a direction and click your LEFT MOUSE BUTTON to shoot, your FreeLancer will move in the opposite direction. If you aim down you fly up, if you aim up you fall down. Simple enough!   </p>\n<p>Remember to mind your life and bullets, if you run out of either you might be in trouble. Once your bullets run out a short reload will see you straightened up, but losing your life will end up with you kicked out of the mission and back in the bulletin board.   </p>\n<p>Feel like you just aren\u2019t sturdy enough? Always seem to be missing that one more bullet? Maybe the reload time is just too long for you? Make sure to use the money from your Gigs to purchase upgrades for your equipment and abilities. Every problem has a solution: Brain, brawn or firepower should see you through!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>*please note that the game is an extremely early state.</p>\n<p><strong>Participating in My First Game Jam Summer 2021.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Font:<br/>(MetalTxus) Jes\u00fas Miguel Cruz Cana<br/>https://www.dafont.com/it/7pixelsofperfect.font<br/></p>\n<p>Music:<br/>nihilore<br/>http://www.nihilore.com/synthwave</p>\n<p>SoundEffects:<br/>adcbicycle<br/>ttps://freesound.org/people/adcbicycle/sounds/13944/<br/>altfuture<br/>https://freesound.org/people/altfuture/sounds/174628/<br/>bevibeldesign<br/>https://freesound.org/people/bevibeldesign/sounds/315826/</p>\n<p>Art: OfekMor</p>\n<p>Programing: YahavSh</p>\n<p>World Setting: Knurt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T06:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b6/0b6410222ce5cb0f741fd2bffce183ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["YahavSh", "Ofekmor", "Knurt"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
