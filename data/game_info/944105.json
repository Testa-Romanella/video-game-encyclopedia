In order to stay here and survive the night here are the rules you must follow.</p>\n<p>1. Find the key of Andrews room and escape before Andrew gets mad.</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0The moment you step out of Andrews room go to the library and check if the left desks light is on. If it is everything is fine for now and you dont have to worry. But if its not there will probably be a creepy man sitting in the chair of the desk. Dont be afraid he is harmless he is there only to scare you off. Just dont think about it and go turn the light on before its too late. You dont want to know what happens when its too late. Also, even if the light is on or you just turned it on, no matter what happens keep checking it regulary because there is a great chance the man on the desk will turn it of again during the night.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0Go search for the basements key and the basement itself. The basements key must be somewhere in the kitchen. But even if you find both of them before 1 am do not open the door or go down to the basement.</p>\n<p>4.\u00a0When the time goes 1 am there will be an agressive knocking in the basement door. I know it will sound crazy but you must go and open it. If you dont you are doomed. But if you do someone will be there. Do not close the door until you see him running back down to the basement and do not follow him. The same thing may happen at 6am.</p>\n<p>5.\u00a0\u00a0Another thing you must consider is the candles. No matter what do not let them turn off and if they turn off, rush and turn them on again. Also keep checking them during the night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>6.\u00a0 Andrew likes hide and seek a lot, so at 4am you will hear him gigling and he will hide somewhere in the house. You must find him before 6am. If you fail to do that he will hide again in 6am and if you fail to find again after that. Thats it you are dead.</p>\n<p>7.\u00a0\u00a0All this will end at 7am.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T07:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed1/ed1ad445f8694007daef8c61b9c5151f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Fexar studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
