This game is inspired by that thing but with a whole lot of twist.</p><p>In this game you have to get the ball out of the circly maze trying to avoid the red balls that spin with you. These are randomly generated puzzles so you will never see the same solution againg.</p><p>Note: As it is a randomly generated puzzle it may happen that a puzzle is unsolvable, but that situation is very hard to get like once in 10,000 times.</p><p>Hope You Have Fun Playing This Thing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:04:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4db/4db2bd801a1ccef5bd94b9cddfde9b87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Div_Sharp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
