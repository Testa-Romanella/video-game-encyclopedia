I really wanted to make this prompt Halloween-themed, so I tried to recreate the fun of running around a park at night with flashlights trying to chase down your buddies. To make the game fit within the prompt, I decided to make it a networked multiplayer game.\u00a0 A game that's \"fun\" to watch has many qualities; however, I decided to focus in on one aspect: dramatic irony. The host of a<em> Say Spook!</em> match does not play, but instead\u00a0has a quad-view of all the players running around the map (this is the spectator view). Here, viewers can watch all of the chaotic chasing in its entirety. They can see everything while the actual players cannot, which adds a lot of fun dynamics to spectating the game. Anyway, Photon was used for networking, and it was a pain in the ass to implement**.</p>\n<p>** Huge shoutout to\u00a0@JRaven for helping me work with Photon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T03:24:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ce/4ce4307301cade3be28eb0c8355aaaaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
