You play as Dakuta and Tallulah who is trying to take down the evil tribe leader Nayati. This is a 2 player game played on the same keyboard so I have tried to keep the controls to a minimum.</p>\n<p>Both players have special abilities both which will help you to win the game, Dakuta's ability is a wave ability, this halves the enemies health and Speed in a range of Dakuta. (only deals 25 damage to Nayati and does not half speed). Tallulah's ability is the Flame ability, this turns the scene to night time, Removes the sun out of the sky and replaces it with a moon, this doubles the damage of both players for 15 seconds.\r\n</p>\n<p>The team has 3 team lives displayed by a pink bar at the top of the screen, If all run out, it will be game over and the play will be forced to restart from the beginning!\r\n</p>\n<p>As you go on your journey through the village, there is gates which will be in place to stop you, there will also be waves of enemies which attack you. When you reach the end you will be approached by Nayati, the evil tribe leader who will try to stop you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T11:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22f/22f36c118a8de8fbc92434cfad191daa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FatSquid"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
