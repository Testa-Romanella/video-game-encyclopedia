We here at Double-A Labs look forward to your unassuming cooperation. The subjects are ready to go, so just grab a control apparatus and we'll begin the tests shortly!<br/><br/><h3>What is Gun Game???</h3><br/>Gun Game is a multiplayer versus party-platformer with guns that get stronger as the game goes on. Each round, players are pitted against each other in a new arena, and a crown is awarded to the last subject standing. After a few of these rounds, its upgrade time! Everyone selects an upgrade from different branching paths, and then it's back to the action. Keep doing this until someone gets X amount of wins, and then that's game!<h3>Current Features</h3><ul><li>16 different guns<br/></li><li>8 different stages<br/></li><li>Local multiplayer for 2-4 players<br/></li><li>Remote multiplayer through Steam Remote Play</li></ul><h3>Planned Features</h3><ul><li>Online play<br/></li><li>Different multiplayer play modes<br/></li><li>Single-player content<br/></li><li>More Guns!<br/></li><li>More Themes!<br/></li><li>More Stages!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T03:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fe/8feb0c49a4ecacd8e6780b18e0d9c58f.jpg", "website": "https://discord.com/invite/UtDXJf22h6", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fireround"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fireround"], "esrb_rating": null}
