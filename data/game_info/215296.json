It's also a platformer, incidentally. Everything in the level that moves (besides you) moves to the beat of a silent song. To beat the game, you'll have to move to the rhythm of the platforms. Also, it could use some\u00a0polishing, so my apologies for the weird, choppy platform movement and total lack of animations.</p>\n<p>Silence was created as part of the GMTK 2018 game jam.</p>\n<p>Controls -</p>\n<p>A - move left</p>\n<p>D - move right</p>\n<p>Space - Jump/walljump</p>\n<p>Note: you get more distance and height from a wall jump if you point away from the wall before you hit space.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/352/35213cc8bd33165c8fcd50b76982e274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["salesbear"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
