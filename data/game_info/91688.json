Includes a logic analyzer to debug your circuits, calculate propagation delays and/or find hazards and glitches. Create and organize components into packages and use them to create larger and better circuits.</li>\n</ul>\r\nLinks\r\n<ul><li>Sandbox (browser version)</li><li>Blog</li><li>Twitter</li><li>GitHub (demo schematics &amp; issue tracker)</li><li>Sandbox manual</li></ul>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: This is an alpha version of the game. Although the simulator is capable of handling relatively complex circuits, you might find that certain configurations don't give the expected results. If this is the case, you can send us the schematic in question to find out what's going on and how we can fix the simulator.<br/></p>\r\nTechnical<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tDLS is a \r\n\t<strong>time-driven event-based multi-delay 3-value</strong> digital logic simulator.<br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Time-driven</strong> means that the circuit time is advanced forward based on a user-specified target speed, which is measured in circuit nanoseconds per real second (ns/s). The simulation will always advance to a new state if there are pending signals in the circuit's queue. This means that even unstable or asynchronous circuits can be correctly simulated.</li>\n<li><strong>Event-based</strong> means that a gate is simulated only if one of its inputs changes value. Otherwise the previous output is considered valid and used as input to all connected gates/components.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-delay</strong> means that each build-in gate/component type has its own propagation delay which is always an integer greater than or equal to 1.</li>\n<li><strong>3-value</strong> means that in addition to logic levels 0 and 1 there's an extra logic value (U for Undefined) which is used as both Z (high impedance) and X (undefined) signals, depending on its origin.</li>\n</ul>\r\nThird party libraries\r\n<p>\r\n\tDLS uses the following free software (in no particular order):\r\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>GLFW - An OpenGL library (http://www.glfw.org/)</li>\n<li>bgfx - Cross-platform rendering library (https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx)</li>\n<li>zange - A single header ANSI C JSON parser (https://github.com/vurtun/zange)</li>\n<li>nanosvg - Simple stupid SVG parser (https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg)</li>\n<li>bnet - Message oriented networking library using TCP transport (https://github.com/bkaradzic/bnet)</li>\n<li>CrashRpt - A crash reporting system for Windows applications (http://crashrpt.sourceforge.net/)</li>\n<li>LuaJIT - a Just-In-Time Compiler for Lua (http://luajit.org/)</li>\n<li>Icons from Font Awesome - the iconic font and CSS toolkit (https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)</li>\n<li>Roboto font (http://www.dafont.com/roboto.font), Anonymous Pro Minus font (http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-p...)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\r\n\tWe would like to thank their developers for building them and making them public/free.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\r\n\tProgramming, testing: Jim Drygiannakis (\r\n\t@jdryg)<br/>\r\nGraphics/UI: Antonis Drygiannakis\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBeta testing: Sam Swain, Richard Matthias, Josh Callebaut\r\n</p>\r\nRelease history\r\n<p>\r\n\tv0.15.0 (2017-07-21)\r\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NEW: Pull up/down resistors</li><li>NEW: Logic Analyzer enhancements</li><li>NEW: Copy component schematic command in component's context menu</li><li>NEW: Better gate/component toolbar</li><li>FIX: SRAM output timings on write were wrong.</li><li>FIX: Schematic file format has been changed slightly to save IO pins before everything else.</li></ol>\n<p>\r\n\tFor details on previous versions, see Releases.txt or the sandbox manual.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fd/3fd598a06c5eb7dbd99c161254c06141.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Making Art Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
