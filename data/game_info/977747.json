You win!<br/></li><li>If the trap makes a breaking sound and disappears you have lost, the ghost will hunt you until you are dead.</li></ul><h3>Things To Note</h3>The ghost will only give 3 evidences.<br/>Each ghost has a favourite room, the ghost will spend most of it's time in it's favourite room. You can find the favourite room by checking the temperatures of all the rooms.<br/>The room which is consistently cooler than the others is likely to be the ghost's favourite room but not certain.<br/>The ghost can turn the light of its current room on/off from anywhere but it has to be near a door or object to interact with it.<h3>How To Get Evidences</h3><br/><strong>Spirit Box</strong><br/>Turn it on and wait to see if the ghost says something.<br/>The spirit box will only give a response if: you are within a certain distance of the ghost, the spirit box is in a room with the light off, and is not outside.<br/><br/><strong>Ghost Writing</strong><br/>Ghost writing will occur if the ghost attempts to throw the clipboard, it will instead write on the clipboard.<br/>If the clipboard is thrown and there is no writing on it it means the ghost does not have ghost writing as an evidence.<br/><br/><strong>Crucifix</strong><br/>If the ghost attempts to hunt and is in the range of the crucifix then the crucific will burn (glow red and make a noise) and there will be no hunt.<br/>If the ghost does not have crucifix as an evidence then it will do nothing.<br/><br/><strong>Ghost Camera</strong><br/>Using the camera you may be able to see the ghost while it is not visible normally. If you see the ghost and it is not hunting then you have got the evidence.<br/>You won't always be able to see the ghost just because it has the evidence, it will only show every 10-50 seconds and only for a short time.<br/><br/><strong>EMF 5</strong><br/>If you get level 5 (The red dot, meaning all the lights are lit up and the tone is very high) then you got the evidence.<br/><br/><strong>Blood</strong><br/>When the ghost throws something it has a chance (it isn't 100%) to make a blood splat on the first surface it touches. If you see a blood splat then you have the evidence.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T10:16:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/007967607b3bb846845e33856abcf3e5.jpg", "website": "https://ancraophobia.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["CoPokBl"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CoPokBl"], "esrb_rating": null}
