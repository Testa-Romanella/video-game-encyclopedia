Instead, you destroy the terrain trying to make others fall off. Currently in a very early developement, we offer 2 game modes...<br/></p>\n<p>1. Free For All - Players attempt to make others fall off map.</p>\n<p>2. Rainbow - When a colour is called, jump onto that colour.</p>\n<p>Very basic, but I have had fun developing it, and would like to put more effort into it. These tests should help me with improvements.</p>\n<p>I am not asking for funding, but every little bit will help further developement of aspects I am not good at e.g. Modelling (You'll see why)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>if you get on but there is nobody to play with.
