As an Oddman, doing all sorts of jobs, one of them goes wrong, and you almost end up dead. On the edge of life, you get lucky and manage to survive. Now you need to return the favour to your saviour.</p><p>Some feedback will be helpful, to the following questions:</p><p>1. Did you like the level?<br/>2. Why?<br/>3. What would you like to see improved?<br/>4. Would a point and click movement fare better than WASD?<br/>5.
