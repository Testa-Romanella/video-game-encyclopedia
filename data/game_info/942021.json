However, if you change the number or the dimensions of the cards, then you will need to locate these lines of code in the first Common Event and edit them to fit your situation:</p>\n\n<p>No plugins are necessary in order for the events to work, however I have used one plugin (pixi-filters.js) in the sample project, in order to add the glow effect to the cards when you hover over them. You can safely omit that plugin if you don't want the glow to happen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T12:48:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c8dccf416fa2567a627248ec5e2425d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arthran2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
