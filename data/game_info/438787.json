In this game you have to collect books that the library manager, Joe, asks you to do. Excuse the music/any bugs I was running low on time. To play use WASD to move and open the bookshelves by pressing the spacebar. To pause the game, press escape. Make sure your character is pointing to the bookshelf when trying to open a bookshelf. Sorry for the art as well haha. I made the art, the talking sound, and the game music. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T02:48:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b70/b701a36e618409f12c2ed428a6c75c1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stevemmmmm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
