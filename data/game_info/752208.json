He was afraid of everyone's eyes. He always felt that people were trying to hurt him, to eat him. The doctor told him to \"rest,\" which he thought was to fatten him up to eat more meat. He remembered that the elder brother had told him about \"eating by changing the son\" and \"sleeping the skin and eating meat\". Then he remembered that when the sister died, the elder brother had advised his mother not to cry, and he thought that the sister had been eaten by the elder brother. The more the \"madman\" rebelled against \"cannibalism\", the more he was considered \"madman\", and when he was completely disappointed with the transformation of the surrounding environment, he also \"healed\" and went somewhere to be an alternate officer. The \"madman\" in the novel is actually an awakened intellectual image. He is surrounded by people whose souls have been eroded by feudal ethics. What he fears and resists is the traditional practice of eating people.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features<br/>\r\nThe core mechanic of Diary of a Madman is the word, which shapes the puzzles and people in the game world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCombat is a fluid and fast-paced style, where you can use a variety of weapon and bullet skills to explore and defeat powerful enemies.<br/>\r\nA well-designed skill system will be an important part of the combat system in order to support smooth combat and enjoy the thrills of constant collisions in combat.<br/>\r\nBack up the bullets!
