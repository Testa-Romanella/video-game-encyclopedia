The game is currently free to play with no microtransaction and thats the way I want it to stay. Not all the features listed above are in the game however I plan to add all of them very soon... To enable all the features go into the options menu and enable 'Beta Mode' this will allow you to encounter enemies and start combat. The game does require an install this is because I am utilizing Microsoft's 'ClickOnce' deployment so that I can push updates out to the user the game can easily be uninstalled by using 'Add or Remove Programs'</em></p><p><em>P.S, Please don't use, sell, market drugs. The game is for education only :P</em></p><p><em>I hope you enjoy the game. If you don't, then come back and tell me why.
