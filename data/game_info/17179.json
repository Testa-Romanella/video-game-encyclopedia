Reports have been mounting about unusual murders on the outskirts of Raccoon City. The city\u2019s Special Forces division, S.T.A.R.S., sends their Bravo Team - including rookie cop member Rebecca Chambers - to investigate. On route, the team\u2019s helicopter suffers engine trouble and is forced to make a crash landing, where they find an overturned prisoner transport vehicle. Splitting up to search the area, Rebecca discovers the Ecliptic Express, a train stopped dead on the tracks. Inside, she meets death row convict and ex-Navy lieutenant Billy Coen. Throughout the game, you will take control of both Rebecca and Billy, at times switching between both characters in order to proceed. Learning the advantages of each character is the key to solving puzzles and surviving the nightmares that lie ahead.FeaturesReturn to the series origins \u2013 Discover the truth behind what led to the horrors at the Mansion in Resident Evil in this fan-favorite and popular prequel title to the series.<br />\nCompletely enhanced visuals \u2013 New high-resolution textures have been created from scratch, including 1080p support on next-gen consoles, while still preserving the classic appearance of the original release.<br />\nFully remastered sound effects \u2013 5.1 surround support provides a more experiential gaming atmosphere that best matches players\u2019 listening environments.<br />\nExperience the horror in the classic 4:3 ratio or newly added 16:9 widescreen mode.<br />\nPlay with the classic control scheme, or enjoy a new alternative scheme where the character moves in the direction of an analogue stick.<br />\nFan-favorite Resident Evil characters \u2013 Rookie S.T.A.R.S. member Rebecca Chambers and wanted criminal Billy Coen combine skills and buddy up to survive the undead and infected nightmares that await them.<br />\nWesker Mode - After completing the main storyline, you will be able to take control of series antagonist Albert Wesker, and use his superhuman abilities to power through the missions.</p>", "metacritic": 69, "released": "2016-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T18:44:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/955/9554440f1c17236c0233b644e47909d2.jpg", "website": "http://www.residentevil.com/", "rating": 3.82, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 234, "owned": 2266, "beaten": 286, "toplay": 86, "dropped": 104, "playing": 30}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 135, "ratings_count": 393, "suggestions_count": 598, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 394, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
