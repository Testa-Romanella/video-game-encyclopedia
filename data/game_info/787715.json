Every year, chefs from across the land gather to compete in a hunting, gathering, and cooking battle royale. Four chefs will enter, but only ONE can claim the title of the Legendary Dragon Chef!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou play as the talented young chef, Paprika, as you serve up conquered creatures and scavenged ingredients in a fanciful set of glittering dungeons to impress the ridiculous panel of judges! Using commonly used cooking utensils such as knives and skewers, you will fight and forage for ingredients inside a perilous geothermal dungeon. Be careful to avoid danger around every corner, and watch your step, lest you become toasted!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve acquired enough ingredients for your recipe, you\u2019ll need to cook swiftly against the clock, all while platforming in a hostile kitchen cave. If you manage to impress the judges with your dish, you\u2019ll move on to the next round and knock out another competitor. Carve your way to the top, chop your fellow chefs, and mark your legacy as the most talented chef in the universe in FOUR. COURSE.
