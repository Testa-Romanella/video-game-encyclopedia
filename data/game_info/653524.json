Its just a little sandbox for me to play around in and build, not much of a game other than driving and exploring. Theres not much to see yet but I plan on adding more over time and making it a nice little world to exist in.</p>\n\n<p>This page basically only exists so I can distribute the build to my friends easier, but if you want to download it and give your feedback that would also be appreciated!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Road Architect by MicroGDS</p>\n<p>https://github.com/MicroGSD/RoadArchitect</p>\n<p>FPS Controller by Colanderp</p>\n<p>https://github.com/colanderp/UnityTutorials<br/></p>\n<p>HSV Color Picker by judah4</p>\n<p>https://github.com/judah4/HSV-Color-Picker-Unity<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T07:54:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10ec20a0d5a7ce04b0f8ed61eb1837ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WoolyDrool"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
