This project was created during March of that year.</p>\n<p>Choose one chest out of three. Each chest has different chances to give you either points or more time on the clock. Earn as many points as you can before running out of time!\r\n</p>\n<p>March has been a strange month, and I haven't had too much time to work in Unity. Regardless, I still have a finished product! I've continued my quest to fully understand Unity's Hybrid ECS. Besides that giant task, this project encouraged me to delve deeper into Unity's new 2D systems, including the 2D Render Pipeline, Tilesets, and 2D Lighting.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T07:06:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83eb0b6672b128bdcecbc3cd4bcdab8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard Stack"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
