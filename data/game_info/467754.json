Issue - A Dusty Heist</strong> you play as master thief Tony Issue. He raids museums to steal all the precious goods, some say his house is a museum on it's own. Tony has the reflexes of a cat and the vision of a hawk, yet he has one problem. He suffers from a dust allergy, this results in (un)controllable sneeze attacks. If you sneeze you will alert the guards around you. Use your sneaky skills to avoid them otherwise they will capture you and you will be put in jail.<br/><br/><strong>Programmer:</strong> Wolfs\u00a0Jonathan\u00a0<br/><strong>Player Feedback:</strong> Wolfs Jonathan<br/><strong>Sounds Design:</strong> Wolfs Jonathan<br/><strong>Level Design:</strong> Ambroos\u00a0Sander\u00a0<br/><strong>3D-Artist:</strong> Ambroos Sander, Vankemenade Beau<br/><strong>Character Design:</strong> Vankemenade Beau<br/><strong>T-Rex Design:</strong> Vankemenade Beau<br/><strong>UX-Design:</strong> Ambroos Sander, Vankemenade Beau, Wolfs Jonathan<br/><strong>Concept Idea:</strong> Sneeze by Ambroos Sander<br/><br/>All assets where created during the 48hour time period, yes even the T-Rex.
