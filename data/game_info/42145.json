While its core gameplay was 4v4 battles, the game had a heavy focus on the sandbox aspect. The game had no single campaign and was free-to-play. Servers were shut down in 2016 due to the lack of audience.<br />\nDuring arena battles, players controlled wizards who used elements to create spells. There were eight elements tied to keyboard buttons; every combination of three elements gave a certain effect on the wizard himself, his teammates or enemies. As the amount of combination was huge, their usage was limited only by players\u2019 imagination. This mechanics was, in fact, a slightly reduced version from Magicka. As every element has an opposite one that counterattacks the spell, battles were based on the reaction rate of players.<br />\nThere were three modes: a classic three-lane map with mobs and bases, a team deathmatch, and a 1v1 duel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-27T12:54:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd0/bd0ae747540a2b38740eb5f59c284a81.jpg", "website": "http://www.wizardwars.com/", "rating": 3.02, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 36, "owned": 1133, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 67}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 111, "suggestions_count": 454, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 111, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paradox North"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Paradox Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
