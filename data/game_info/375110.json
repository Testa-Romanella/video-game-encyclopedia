This is the story of Oscar Teak, who isn't that hero.<br/></p>\n<p>When would-be punk-rock drummer Oscar Teak gets kicked out of his band on the first day, his day is ruined and his confidence is crushed. He's gotta buck up, though; the wildlife has begun attacking people, a \"forest spirit\" has decided to boss Teak around, and his childhood friend Tamree's gone missing! Will Oscar be able to regain his constitution and save the day, or will he fall victim to his own self-loathing and clumsiness?<br/></p>\n<p><em>Teak's Tall Tale</em> is a simple run-and-gun platformer. You can walk, jump, aim your gun in four directions, and fire. There ain't much to it, as it's just a short l'il game.<br/></p>\n<br/>What is this Nonsense?\r\n<p><em>Meander Forth Pilot: Teak's Tall Tale</em> was created as a free \"demo\" campaign for a larger project called <em>Westlouia: Meander Forth, </em>kinda like what <em>Pink Hour</em> is to <em>Kero Blaster </em>or <em>PT </em>is to <em>Silent Hills </em>(RIP.) It's called \"Pilot\" because it's like an 11-minute pilot for a TV show, except it's a video game!</p>\n<p><em> </em>Please support the production in any way you can, including donating to the project, supporting my Patreon (coming soon), backing the Kickstarter (coming soon), and/or just commenting down below. A little feedback goes a long way, even if it's negative! Or, you can just do nothing. I'm not your mom. No skin off my nose!</p>\r\nIt's Free!\r\n<p>You CAN pay for it if you want, and itch will prompt you to donate $2.00, but you don't have to.<br/></p>\r\nContent Notice:\r\n<p>This game contains some slightly harsh language.
