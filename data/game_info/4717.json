Planar rifts are appearing in various locations around the country and it is suspected that the Drexler Institute, a player in the Great War many years ago and creator of the Divine Celestial Weapon, is involved. There is a rumor circulating that if one gets their hands on a celestial stone from a rift, their wishes will be granted. Their power draws many young women to search for them, either to seal them away or in hopes that the rumors are true. Each has their own reasons for the hunt, and they won\u2019t allow anyone stand in their way, enemy...or friend alike.\r\n<br/><br/><br/>\r\nPublished and distributed by Aksys Games with permission from ARC SYSTEM WORKS.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
