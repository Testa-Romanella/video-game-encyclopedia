I used this as an opportunity to learn how to use Unreal Engine, and as a result the game didn't get to where I wanted it to be from a design perspective. I think it still has at least a couple interesting ideas so it may still be worth your time to play! <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:13:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbd/cbdd5171b88235008a73bc490ffbfb12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["salkind"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
