Conquer galactic territories through combat, complete missions, and use the experience gained to upgrade your crew and ship or acquire more spacecraft.<br/><br/>Fight alongside your faction to claim every system in the galaxy, one planet at a time. Work with allies to forge new friendships and clans, or go rogue and discover worlds on your own.

Their technological advantage also excels in propulsion, as the Sol\u2019s ion drive technology surpasses the Genari\u2019s fusion drives. Their officers focus on defensive skills.<br/><br/>The <strong>Genari United Empire</strong> are falling behind in the technological race, but have more maneuverable ships with advanced armor. They also have marine pods, which offset their disadvantage by boarding onto enemy ships and either causing crew casualties or capturing the ship outright. Their officers focus on offensive skills.<br/> <br/>The <strong>Ma\u2019Alaketh Confederation</strong> wield technology that is centuries ahead compared to Sol and Genari. Little is known about them other than their minimal interest in the conflict between the warring races. They have more distinct long-ranged weaponry and dampening fields that make them harder to hit. Their officers focus on technology-based skills.<br/> <br/>The <strong>Hive</strong> are sentient creatures that live and die in space.  Starting as spores, they use absorbed energy from solar radiation and organic matter captured from enemy ships to grow into larger forms. Their weaponized nature stems from a need for self defense, causing them to produce lethal defense mechanisms that develop as they advance. They have no crew but improve through growth and absorption of defeated races.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c9ad71be94c6815b7c679c4e6f8b770.jpg", "website": "https://www.spacewars.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 129, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Desert Owl Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["ToHeroes Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
