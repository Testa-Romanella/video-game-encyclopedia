JAZZ'S RHYTHM WORKOUT!</strong></p>\n<p>A game created by John Cervantes for DMD 2542</p>\n<p>You play as a strange little alien Creature of indeterminate origin, who decides to sign up for a jazzercise class to study humanity.</p>\n<p>But here's the problem-- you don't have a single dancing bone(?) in your body!! All you have are two left feet(?)!</p>\n<p>Luckily, five-time national dance champion and professional jazzercise instructor/philanthropist/celebrity Ms. Jazz decides to help you out! Just follow her lead!</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>You have four buttons, each one representing a different exercise dance: a high kick, a step, a hip thrust, and a lunge.</p>\n<p>Ms. Jazz will bust a move, and you have to repeat it by pressing that move's button.</p>\n<p>Each turn, Ms. Jazz will add a new move to the sequence. Do your best to remember all the steps exactly!</p>\n<p>But don't forget, this is also a dance class! You must feel the rhythm!</p>\n<p>Press a button to the beat of the music, and you'll gain bonus points.</p>\n<p>Do that multiple times in a row, and you'll rack up a SYNC COMBO bonus that snowballs points!</p>\n<p>But be careful! Get even one step of the dance wrong, and you fall flat on your face!</p>\n<p>You can reset your high scores in the main menu if you'd like.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p>BGM \"Funk Beat\" by eliot-beats - https://freesound.org/people/eliot-beats/sounds/538719/</p>\n<p>Lose sound effect by cabled_mess - https://freesound.org/people/cabled_mess/sounds/350985/</p>\n<p>All other sounds and voicelines created from my mouth.</p>\n<p>All sprites, artwork and animation created by me!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T17:26:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/183e5caa462d39a1042d27b3a8c928d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cinnamatsu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
