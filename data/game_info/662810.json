Resistance is futile.\r\n</p>\n<p>I focused much more on polish and animation this time around, and I think it shows. This entry still lacks a musical track like my previous entries, just due to my lack of knowledge in that field. However, it is packed with custom-recorded sound effects, slick animations, and nifty particle effects!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>This game runs on Unity's Web Player, which may no longer work in your web browser.</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:08:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/8240da678f91d4ce5e4e0ad417c2ccd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Richard Stack"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
