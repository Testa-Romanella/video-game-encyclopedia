So far you can only walk around and grab the box in the map(just by touching it),but you can't let go of it .</p>\n<p>Tell me what you think, does it have potential? - if so I will start full time development on it. In the next update you can expect Grass, textured terrain and the ability to\u00a0<em><strong>Grab</strong></em> and\u00a0<em>let go</em> of objects with ease.</p>\n<p>The game will aim to include multiplayer ie. LAN, so you can join your friends and will aim to launch on mobile(preferably).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T06:34:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f50/f506469d184cba1b7e9d9fb66f413dc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drie_Ice"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
