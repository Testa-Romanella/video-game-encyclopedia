In fact, this graveyard is well-known for housing the world's largest mausoleum. Turns out, it's not funny, and you're the billionaire! The dead are here to get their revenge and your flashlight is quickly dying. Good news, it seems as though the construction workers left behind a lot of batteries for your very inefficient flashlight. You at least thought ahead, and brought your best bonking hammer. Hit zombies on their head to stun them, or hit them before they fully resurrect to acquire precious batteries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The zombies wish you good luck, billionaire! Hopefully you make it back to your vast riches alive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T03:33:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/088/0887abb7857e0a84342a1fed2876467e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HadMatter00"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
