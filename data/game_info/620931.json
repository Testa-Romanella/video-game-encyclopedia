Rocket Rumble!\r\n<p>Individually, these games are quite easy. The spikes are immobile, and there's plenty of space to go round. The rockets are slow, and not especially frequent. However, when these games are put together side by side, a new challenge emerges. You must concentrate on both sides of the screen simultaneously, in order to achieve success.</p>\n<p>This game was inspired by 'Two Games One Controller' speedruns. The premise is rather self-explanatory: beat two games simultaneously while only using one controller. However, the skill involved is immense - and beyond my ability to describe.
