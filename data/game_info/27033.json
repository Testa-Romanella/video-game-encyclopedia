Along the way you'll encounter curous \n      creatures like the shy Bigfoot, which you can scare away with your \n      oversized flash camera, and use dynamite to blow up rocks in your path.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71b/71b144c7eafcca2a122f9da137a0d665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 343, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Virtual Play Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
