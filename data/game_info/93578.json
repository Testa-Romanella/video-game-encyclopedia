{"id": 93578, "slug": "orphan-age-itch", "name": "Orphan Age (itch)", "name_original": "Orphan Age (itch)", "description": "<p>Orphan Age is a\u00a0<strong>life-sim game</strong>\u00a0where you\u00a0<strong>look after a band of orphans</strong>\u00a0in a\u00a0<strong>cyberpunk warzone</strong>.</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>Set against the backdrop of an unforgiving,\u00a0<strong>neon-lit dystopian warzone</strong>, your only battle is the fight for survival, scraping out a living in the face of extreme danger. You will\u00a0<strong>guide a band of orphans</strong>, each with their own skills, emotions, strengths, weaknesses and fears, through a\u00a0<strong>dangerous and ever-changing city</strong>\u00a0in a bitter struggle for survival.<br/></p>\n<p>Constantly\u00a0<strong>balancing risk and reward</strong>, you must make the big decisions to\u00a0<strong>ensure the group stays alive</strong>.\u00a0<strong>Build</strong>\u00a0up your base,\u00a0<strong>scavenge</strong>,\u00a0<strong>craft</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>explore</strong>\u00a0the city for new recruits, whilst ensuring there are enough supplies to\u00a0<strong>keep going</strong>, even when it seems\u00a0<strong>all hope might be lost</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<p>Orphan Age plays as a single player campaign with a lot of replayability inspired by the 4X genre. But there\u2019s a twist!</p>\n<p>4X stands for\u00a0<strong>Exploration</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Exploitation</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Expansion</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Extermination</strong>. In Orphan Age, we replace Extermination with\u00a0<strong>Empathy</strong>, bending the 4X genre into a 4E.</p>\n<p>The city of Orphan Age is ever-changing and procedural. You won't find the same building twice. There are\u00a0<strong>high risks and high rewards</strong>\u00a0when you\u00a0<strong>explore</strong>. You can find\u00a0<strong>rare resources</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Orphans to recruit</strong>, but you can also get wounded or worse...<br/><br/>Exploration is similar to the expeditions of Fallout Shelter: procedural text adventures. They offer more complexity though, because you have to make decisive choices while you're out of the orphanage.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Hundreds of resources</strong>\u00a0are left to be scavenged in the Orphanage or in the city. They are classified in\u00a0<strong>6 categories</strong>\u00a0that allow you to eat, drink, take care of wounds and to craft the items and resources you need to build your Orphanage.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>The Orphanage is the place your Orphans call home. The\u00a0<strong>environment</strong>\u00a0surrounding the Orphans greatly affects their moods. Try to keep the rooms lit, warm, furnished and clean for the happiness of all!\u00a0<br/><br/>There are\u00a0<strong>38 different items of furniture to build</strong>\u00a0(beds, playgrounds, science mats, campfire, heaters...) and each one can be\u00a0<strong>upgraded</strong>.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Research</strong>\u00a0allows you to discover better furniture and improve living conditions for the orphans.<br/><br/><br/>Orphan Age is a<strong>\u00a0deep micro-simulation</strong>\u00a0making each Orphan unique in personality and in gameplay. The Orphans have\u00a0<strong>different ages, set of skills, backgrounds and personality traits</strong>. Depending on who they are and how well they are, the Orphans will take\u00a0<strong>different paths</strong>anytime there is an issue to be discussed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>INFO:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Available in Early Access this winter</li><li>For PC, Mac &amp; Linux</li><li>Comes with a companion visual novel Orphan Age: Diaries</li><li>Music composed by Makeup And Vanity Set</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b81/b81cbb99d8680d138622a1e00288ebc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Studio Black Flag", "Layar", "KrisWB"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
