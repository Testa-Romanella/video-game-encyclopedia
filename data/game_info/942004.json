{"id": 942004, "slug": "rabbit-is-hungry", "name": "Rabbit is Hungry", "name_original": "Rabbit is Hungry", "description": "<p>Rabbit the Dog loves to eat. However, she has a tender stomach. If she eats greasy or dairy foods, she gets an upset stomach and has stinky gas. She is safe with most meats, especially bacon. She also eats starchy vegetables, but not leafy, green vegetables. She also tries to avoid taking any medication because she does not like the taste.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In this game, move Rabbit around the house by tapping on the screen in the direction you want her to go. In each room you will find things that Rabbit might want to eat (or play with). To get Rabbit the Dog to interact with things in the room, tap them when she is standing on top of them. The goal is to help Rabbit eat all ten tasty treats found in the house. But, beware the foods that give her a stomach ache and things that she thinks are yucky! If your energy starts to run low, you can always go back to the dog food and water dishes to get your energy back up.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a simple, short game meant to amuse children long enough to allow their parents or grandparents to check out at the store - or some other short activity.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is intentionally easy.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is intentionally short.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is intentionally childish.
