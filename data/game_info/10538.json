We\u2019ve built a game that we\u2019re still quite proud of, and we couldn\u2019t have done any of it without you. We also hope to see you again in our next journey - whatever that might be.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/>Take to the skies and fly past mountains in a wingsuit. Try to hug the cliffs at over 250 km/h or cruise at high altitudes and admire the scenery.<br/><br/>Your body and gear are fully physically simulated. You fly by controlling your character's muscles directly, which changes your pose, which interacts with the air around you. You can see, hear, and feel every gust of wind as you pass it.<br/><br/>The current version already has a lot to play around with:<br/><ul><li>A single, finely tuned wingsuit to fly with<br/></li><li>Customizable parachutes<br/></li><li>A huge landscape inspired by the Swiss and French Alps, with lots of lines to try<br/></li><li>Dynamic time and weather that is also completely customizable<br/></li><li>Multiple camera perspectives (including first-person view)<br/></li><li>Highly configurable graphics and input settings<br/></li><li>Time Trials that push your skills to the limit</li></ul><br/>Gamepad or Joystick recommended!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39f/39f955b3bd006c884856fddbdc6b0cdf.jpg", "website": "http://volo-airsport.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 20}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ramjet Anvil"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ramjet Anvil"], "esrb_rating": null}
