One generation, you found a shiny block-shaped gem, unlike the sandstone blocks your ancestors slaved their lives away to transport. Sneak it between the tallat's long robes and explore your way into the monument with this little secret in hand.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Select a lupul to control with aleft mouse button, and guide it forward with the mouse pointer. Click to hatch after being reborn.</p>Notes / known issues<ul><li>The Mac build hasn't been tested yet!</li><li>There are no visual indicators for player controls and various events. Sorry!</li><li>There is no ending (though we had one planned), but if you reach a dead end you\u2019ve made it. Double sorry!</li><li>The character animations are inconsistent - we didn\u2019t get to polish it all.</li><li>The camera tends to jump a bit confusingly when your current lupul dies.</li><li>The gem can be pretty easily occluded by piles of dead lupuls - look for its shine in between the bodies!</li></ul>Credits<ul><li>Omniopticon\u00a0- concept/game design, world/character design, art assets</li><li>Yoel Simhovich - concept/game design, animation, asset integration, programming</li><li>Eden Shazar - concept/game design, programming, asset integration</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c48/c483a8d571ece22f8ef626a84ef02e35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Temporarium"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
