Also, WebGL isn't great on all computers so if you have performance issues try the windows version.</p>\n<p><em>P.S. It also looks better on windows</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls &amp; Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Movement: WASD</p>\n<p>\u2022 Jump: Space</p>\n<p>\u2022 Shoot: Left Click</p>\n<p>\u2022 Start placing tower: 1, 2, 3, 4</p>\n<p>\u2022 Toggle overview: Tab</p>\n<p>\u2022 This is multiplayer; grab a coworker and play this!!! It does work fine single player though.</p>\n<p>\u2022 There are some networking bugs such as gameplay desyncing and with packet loss. (Also we didn't have time to handle players leaving so if a player leaves it can cause issues). This was a four week prototype after all lol</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some Troubleshooting tips for the browser version:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 To pause the game, you will likely have to press escape multiple times (it's a webGL issue unfortunately)</p>\n<p>\u2022 If the game isn't letting you turn completely click the screen (happens when exiting the game player in webGL)</p>\n<p>\u2022 If aiming feels laggy, reduce the sensitivity. This happens at low frame rates with high sens</p>\n<p>\u2022 If the game has low frame rates, try a different browser like OperaGX</p>\n<p>\u2022 Download the windows version if you are experiencing too many issues in the web version</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T10:04:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d96b9426afa8f8805c65232d2d8d1c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Welch - Game Designer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
