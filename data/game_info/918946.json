Unfortunately not everyone is able to see stereograms, but the following is a technique that might help some people</p>\n<p>Relax your eyes until the two rectangles above fully overlap, at which point\u00a0you should see a square coming out of the screen<br/></p>\n<p>(some people achieve this by moving their face\u00a0close to the screen, until the images overlap,\u00a0and then slowly moving their face away)</p>\n\n<p>Stereograms can also be viewed by going cross-eyed. The game has a toggle for this as well as other accessibility options</p>\n<p>More information can be found in README.txt or on Wikipedia</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stereograms can be quite taxing on the eyes!\u00a0Please take regular breaks, letting your eyes\u00a0recover each time before continuing the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T21:45:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/852/85231faf19e6cd1ef114420968339098.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Linssen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
