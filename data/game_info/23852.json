Or, one player can race against the clock \n      and strive to get the high score. With 8 fast-paced levels, each with \n      unique events and environs, along with a day/night setting, no two \n      matches will ever be the same. Retro Road Rumble truly gives players the \n      chance to have the type of one of a kind experience that only the Wii U \n      can offer!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4eb4391b3a91d238dc8c7cfef94bbdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["Sketchy Coyote Interactive"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sketchy Coyote Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
