Luscious meadows. Luminous high-rises. Sparkling lakes. Glistening skies. Beautiful paradise.\u00a0Heavens Fall is a utopia. Perfect in every shape and form.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, technology had revolutionized Heavens Fall and the society people lived in, connecting all facets of life and rejuvenating\u00a0the intellectual curiosity of all people. At the core of this development stood a central figure. An icon to which the city owed its gratitude for its prosperity:</p>\n<p><strong>TITAN</strong>, the tech giant of Heavens Fall.</p>\n\r\nDeveloper's Note\r\n<p>Hi, Vifer here. I am the lead developer/coder and script writer of TITAN. I spent 1.5 months (May 1, 2020 - June 19, 2020) developing TITAN and it has been a fascinating experience. I learned a lot about game development, coding (with Ren'Py), and project management - far more than I'd ever expect. Thanks to all of you who decide to give the game a playthrough - I truly appreciate it.</p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks </strong>to<strong>\u00a0</strong>Audrey Liu (CG artist) and Red Chan (Sprite assets), along with many other individuals that have helped me throughout TITAN's development (credited in-game). I would have never been able to do this without you.</p>\n<p><strong>Lastly</strong>, I have a strong passion for videogames and recently began streaming on Twitch. Feel free to follow me and catch me live sometime! You can find me at\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/vifer_x. Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T03:42:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c52fdc3f953084eea742964afd4bf8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vifer Gaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
