Everything is in your hands.<br/><br/>LegendArya is the survival-shooting game in which you control your player with only one hand. You only control your hero's movement, he will take care of the rest.<br/><br/>Zombie's are coming? He will shoot them at once.<br/>Bad men are coming? He will take them out as well.<br/><br/>Position yourself wisely and there are no one to stop you.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>If you like, hear the story out before the adventure of your life begins.<br/><br/>It all started when a doctor, who is still missing, called the largest hospital in the country and warned them.<br/><br/>I know it sounds crazy, but the \"Zombie\" virus we see in the movies was spreading rapidly.<br/><br/>With each new person bitten, the danger grew even larger.<br/>Although the zombie threat might unite people for a while, it didn't last long. New threats have occurred. Looters, rebels, mercenaries, lonely human hunters ...<br/><br/>The number of zombies increased uncontrollably. To move from one city to another, you had to go through huge zombie hordes.<br/><br/>The strategies I developed to overcome the zombie hordes collapsed with the new zombie species. It's really hard to beat them!<br/><br/>I remember now.<br/><br/>Who would have thought that my teddy bear Minno\u015f, which my mother gave as a gift on my sixth birthday, would be the key to this story?<br/><br/>At the age of 12, my mother and father were in a great rush after school. The expression on their faces evoked a single emotion in me; \"fear\"!<br/><br/>They embraced me lovingly. My father whispered these words in my ear as he hugged me;<br/><br/>\"Whatever happens, don't lose your teddy bear, Minno\u015f! You two will save the world.\"<br/><br/>Save the world? Expecting someone who is constantly reading comics to save the world could be just a fantasy of a scientist whose nickname is \"crazy\".<br/><br/>And they left ...<br/><br/>I've never seen them since then. Exactly a year after this incident, a sound recording that crashed on the Internet had a big effect.<br/><br/>\u201c\u2026 Find the teddy bear. Doctor Crazy's formula is in him. Please find him before it's too late. The name of the person you should find is ... \"<br/>Sound recording ends here.<br/>\"You two will save the world...\"<br/><br/>This sentence, which is constantly ringing in my brain, is now more meaningful than ever ...<br/><br/>Next day; the country's largest hospital was called by a doctor. He was previously dismissed because of his theories about zombies.<br/><br/>Today\u2026<br/><br/>There are zombies everywhere.<br/>And a lot of teddy bears ...<br/><br/>Obviously, there are others who want to save the world. Or to destroy it!<br/>I have lost those who raised me and everyone I knew.<br/><br/>This is the first day of my journey.<br/><br/>Even if it takes forever, I will find my teddy bear \"Minno\u015f\" and learn about my father's legacy...<br/><br/>You can find detailed information about<br/>Subscription Pricing and Terms here:<br/>https://www.aryasgames.com/legendarya-subscriptionterms<br/><br/>Privacy Policy:<br/>https://www.aryasgames.com/legendarya-privacy-policy<br/><br/>Terms &amp; Conditions:<br/>https://www.aryasgames.com/legendarya-terms-conditions", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T01:57:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e78/e78a3318c6c898e02e3962df887f3ea0.jpg", "website": "https://www.aryasgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["soneraltincit"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Soner Alt\u0131ncit"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
