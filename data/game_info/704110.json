{"id": 704110, "slug": "bear-of-the-west", "name": "Bear Of The West", "name_original": "Bear Of The West", "description": "<p>Bear of the West is a short text adventure game where you play as a cowboy detective on the hunt for notorious outlaw\u00a0Bear Jackson. After a bank robbery in the town of Cattle Point, you take the job to arrest Bear Jackson and stop his reign of terror.</p>\n\n<p>I made this for my Programming 1 class Midterm. It is written in C#.\u00a0I had a lot of fun writing this. I wrote a similar western choose-your-own adventure game in Java in high school, but it was nice to be able to write another one with new improvements. This is my first game in C#, so I was proud of the features I added beyond the requirements of the assignment. I made the console color changes based on location, to give each town a different feel. I also made it so that the \"Press any key to continue\" message is replaced by the next line of dialogue when you press a key, which I think gives a nice game feel and helps with immersion. Overall, I am very happy with how this project turned out.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programmed, Written, and Designed by Lane Howard</p>\n<p>ASCII Art from https://www.asciiart.eu/buildings-and-places and http://www.network-science.de/ascii/</p>\n<p>Menu and Scene structure based on tutorials by Mike Hadley</p>\n<p>Additional programming assistance from users on Stack Overflow</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:25:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02fd9e8297cab8ff739f3965136ee6de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lane Howard"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
