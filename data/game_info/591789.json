Two brothers, born atop its craggy, lofty peaks rolled down at birth until they reached, each of them, a village on opposite sides of the mountain.</p>\n<p>Out of pure happenstance, they were both named <strong>Deeper</strong>, and they didn't know each other at the time.\u00a0 Young, strong, strapping lads, but eventually they yearned for a deeper connection. A deeper companionship. And they ended up being pen pals with each other. The years passed, and time took its toll, and they were pen pals for about fifty years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eventually it came time and they decided to meet each other, however the mountain that birthed them all those years ago still loomed large in the middle. And so they decided to go <em>through </em>the mountain and go deeper and deeper into the mountain to make a deeper and deeper connection with each other. Two brothers, pen pals for over fifty years, finally wanting to reunite.</p><p>A game by\u00a0David Tersegno, Zach Rosen, Declan Oller, and Ben Wiener</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T06:47:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edc/edc849970f977f7c1ed1d86232020f21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ishmandoo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
