Unfortunatly it's only in portuguese (pt-pt), but it's easy to understand since there are only 5 words in it. You can also press F1 for an About window and F2 and/or F3 to change colors. In case you're wondering why it's called \"jogo do galo\" that's what we call the tic-tac-toe game in Portugal.</p><p>The source code might not have everything, I think it's missing the .h file that's included in main.c.</p>\n<p>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9sN1EdZZQZ1jmh1I6S3lJA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:20:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b80/b8097777ddf22b626dfeb765527fc14e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IgorAkou"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
