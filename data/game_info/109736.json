Each player controls their army with only two buttons, making combat simple to learn, yet difficult to master. <em>Two Button Army</em>'s gameplay mechanics provide an arcade-like experience where players quick attack, heavy attack, and parry their way through an enemy army to destroy their castle. By taking proven combat mechanics and fusing them with our vision of controlling an army acting in unison, we have created a combat system that has not been explored in gaming.</p><p><em>Two Button Army</em> is still in development, stay tuned for more updates!<br/></p><p>For any inquiries, please email us at: littlepapersoldiers@gmail.com</p><p><strong>Developed by </strong><em><strong>Little Paper Soldiers</strong></em></p><p>Kevin Toney - <em>Project Lead</em> (ktoney.com)</p><p>Mikhail Strubler - <em>Programmer </em>(mistrubler.wix.com/eportfolio)</p><p>Tabby Hein - <em>Artist</em> (tabbycatmeoww@gmail.com)</p><p>Aaron Huang - <em>Designer/QA </em>(asr950@gmail.com)</p><p>Kevin Mester - <em>Designer/Sound Designer </em>(kevm53@sbcglobal.net)</p><p>Aaron Stearns - <em>Composer </em>(aaronstearnsrecording@gmail.com)</p><p><em>Special Thanks to William Meyers</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98c647ad96c493acb89242773b5c9f78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KevinT"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
