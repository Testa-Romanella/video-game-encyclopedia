Inside lives Natalya, a mechanical girl, and her pet cat Pudding, a cat she saved with her body's energy in a junkyard, and their fates have been bound together ever since. One day when Natalya was out looking for ingredients, her body malfunctioned and her energy was depleted by a small explosion. The only way to revive Natalya is to collect the corresponding energy source and put it back into her body. Natalya and Pudding are the only ones who depend on this deserted world, not only are their fates one, their lives are also one. They can not lose each other, Natalya gave Pudding a chance to live again, Pudding will also use its own ability to wake up Natalya at this time.</p>\n<p>Pudding needs to collect the corresponding energy source in each room within a limited time, and there will be different challenges waiting for Pudding in each room, it needs to use its wisdom and bravery to solve the challenges and collect all the energy sources. This is the only way to save Natalya.</p>\n<p>- Success</p>\n<p>The overall game flow, mechanism, and story background are pretty good. I'm very happy with what we ended up with, the new version of the story. The cyberpunk style came out so much better than the original concept, and we made the story background more interesting. Also, the interaction in our game is very fun to try out, besides the basic collecting and pushing objects, we add more stuff into our game. Such as turning the lights and opening cabinet, these interaction provides further game experience to the player. The entire game mood and scenes totally fit our game\u00a0theme. I enjoy designing this game a lot, even though it's not easy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Failures</p>\n<p>I would say there are definitely some small issues we still have in our game. One is the music, the background music now is too loud, which covers the sound of collecting energy balls. I was trying to figure out how to adjust the volume in Unity and for some reason it still not working. Also, we were supposed to have different sound backgrounds in each sense, but the prefabs may not be recognized and made every background the same music. The other one is our play visual. In the game mode, the player's perspective will always appear jittery, we tried to make the player higher from the floor but still didn't solve this problem. As for our character in the game, we were planning to have some animation of the girl when the player made interaction with her at the last, I tried several times to make the bones move but got failed. So this is something I wish I would learn how to do in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Lessons Learned\u00a0</p>\n<p>The entire process pushed me to try different skills and technic I didn't know before. One big thing I guess is Unity Collaborate, as working in a group can be very annoying, Github is too complex and need to download every time, so we found out Unity Collaborate, and it saved us. Another thing is different interaction in 3D game building, things would be kinda different in 2D. We have a few interesting interactions in our game, and it's what we never learned before.\u00a0But working as a group actually is very helpful in Unity, we are all learning from each other, each person has their own strength, and we could always support each other in some ways.\u00a0</p><p>- Future Development\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would say definitely make the music sounds better and fit to the interaction during the game. Also, I would like to make the game start sense as the 3D version,\u00a0it would be\u00a0more in line with the overall unity of the 3D game. Of course, the animation of the girl is a big part of the game I feel, and adding more physical interaction in the game would be more fun and challenging. (Even though the game now is quite challenging\u00a0for me to play lol). </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T07:32:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc4/bc4b7056d7494ad52818d268552df2f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zhuoyingwang"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
