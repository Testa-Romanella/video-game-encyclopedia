{"id": 301454, "slug": "rob-cas", "name": "Rob & Cas", "name_original": "Rob & Cas", "description": "<p>This game is about two characters, a painter and his drawn figure that came to life, who try to save paintings by working together. Said paintings are haunted by colour-eating entities, which threaten the painter to lose all his work before his premiere. Each character is played by an individual player, making this a co-op multiplayer game.<br/>The painter can alter scenarios with his brush (or other art tools) to create bridges, barricades, portals etc. to assist the drawn figure. He does so by using a pointing device (ex: mouse) and using different colors for different effects.</p>\n<p>The drawn figure moves through the painting, working against evil creatures which also came alive trying to erase the painting. This character has basic 2-dimensional movement, is affected by gravity and can collect key-items within the painting which the painter cannot get by himself. Those items aid the drawn figure to combat the colour-eating entities or to enhance his capabilities (higher jumping, faster running).</p>\n\n<p>How to play:<br/>The mouse user can draw either a line, a triangle or a circle. If the shape is drawn correctly, it will stay and can be interacted with Cas.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T04:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f87/f87d5e473dca0a9faf70bc828b77dcd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gdd2018grp13"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
