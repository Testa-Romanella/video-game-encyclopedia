The player is tasked with playing two games at once: a 3D endless runner on the main screen, and a 2D endless runner on a phone zipping back and forth on their screen. If the player dies in either of these games, they fail and must restart. The central thesis of this game is to simulate the way attention is split when texting and driving, and to demonstrate how much more prone to mistakes people are when multitasking.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>If you\u00a0<strong>text and drive</strong>, you're 23 times more likely to have a car crash. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee2/ee24176cae0ad757ab44a22215506db4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kertis Jones"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
