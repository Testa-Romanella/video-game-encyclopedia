Others are visceral flyers that aren't interested in the objective as much they're interested in destroying you.Endless waves<br/>See how long you can hold out against the relentless invaders and compete for the top spot on the <strong>global leaderboard</strong> as waves get increasingly difficult.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/694/6943ec3c16d56acd57e215f7526875c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 626, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ITC Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ITC Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
