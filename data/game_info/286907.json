Has some interesting ideas, but I had no time to work on it this past week, very busy.

Did have some fun ideas for the theme but they aren't incorporated in this prototype yet.</p><p>I'll put more time into future Weekly Game Jams. Even if I can't put more than a few hours into a project, I do want to do this every week from now on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T03:47:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/952b2d8938d3abdb7fe6d46a37a1eda6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar The Clovis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
