{"id": 977711, "slug": "paranormal-found-footage", "name": "Paranormal: Found Footage", "name_original": "Paranormal: Found Footage", "description": "<h3>BACKSTORY</h3>You are a student journalist who decides to make a documentary about the abandoned \u00abNorth\u00bb cosmodrome, where in the 1990s a series of man-made disasters occurred that caused serious genetic changes in humans and animals, forming previously unknown mutations. Almost the entire population was evacuated, and an exclusion zone appeared on the territory of the cosmodrome along with the nearest settlements.<br/><br/>Two of your friends, who are well-versed in these places and know how to get to the abandoned spaceport, are going on an expedition with you. They drove ahead, and you followed them in your car. But halfway along the way, a snowstorm began and you did not notice how you turned the wrong way, strayed from other members of the expedition and got stuck in the middle of the forest in the exclusion zone. Attempts to contact friends were unsuccessful. Deciding that the spaceport is not too far away, you decide to walk the rest of the route alone through the forest, taking your camera with you.<h3>FEATURES</h3>This is a game in the genre of \"found footage\", where you control the camera of a character in the first person. You will be able to explore a really huge exclusion zone, encounter paranormal phenomena, plunge into the mystical atmosphere of the winter forest and perhaps you will be able to find out the real reason for the closure of the \u00abNorth\u00bb cosmodrome.<br/><br/>Found Footage: Paranormal \u2014 offers you a unique experience of immersion in the atmosphere of real chthonic horror, using realistic Unreal Engine 5 graphics, sophisticated sound design and a system of random encounters with entities during your journey. Do not forget, the world in which you find yourself lives by its own rules and your appearance in it will not go unnoticed.<h3>What will you do if you find yourself in the forest at night?</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T08:47:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0d/f0d431224af7a5f5a2814368d688e6e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paphnutius"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WINTERMUTE"], "esrb_rating": null}
