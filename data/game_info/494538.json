This game was inspired by the current struggles we are faced with today with the horrific reality of climate change. Climate change is something that not only is on everyone\u2019s minds but is effecting our daily lives and is only doomed to further effect our lives on a greater scale from here on out. This seemingly simple game is meant to initially engage people with a like-able creature - a fox - and a beautiful surrounding. The interaction is minimal but the fox runs around hunting for food while the environment slowly changes showing the melting of the snow around it and slowly with it the availability of food. Eventually the fox runs out of resources and passes away. The ending screen states a statistic sourced from NASA about melting ice and glacier within the most recent years. By creating this browser based game it is available to the masses with a cute style and approachable gameplay but with a deeper message behind it raise awareness of climate change. </p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: All coding done in Unity by Chris Davidoff.
