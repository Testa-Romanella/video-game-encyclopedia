Don't ask, instead focus on the police cars and signs coming at you!</p>\n\n<p>This game is a remake of on old project of the same name made with Construct 2. I gave up on it, and recently thought I could try remaking it from scratch in Godot, and this time actually\u00a0finish it! So this project started 5 or 6 years ago, and I'm finally done with it now ^^ The original ressources are available on OpenGameArt.<br/></p>\n<p>I also tried to focus on content production, and not so much about code improvement and clarity, just to see how much I could speed it up. End results? This isn't a good idea at all... I actually spent much more time on the code than before, so look into the source code at your own risk!</p>\n<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Online leaderboard</strong> by SilentWolf (https://silentwolf.com/)<br/></p>\n<p><em>Battle</em> by Jahzzar (https://soundcloud.com/jahzzar/)</p>\n<p><em>Orbital Colossus</em> by Matthew Pablo (https://www.matthewpablo.com)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T07:37:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1c/d1cb27c68bf80bfaff3f9d561d6194fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ivan Voirol"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
