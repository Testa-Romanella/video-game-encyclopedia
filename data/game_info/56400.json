{"id": 56400, "slug": "conan-hall-of-volta", "name": "Conan: Hall of Volta", "name_original": "Conan: Hall of Volta", "description": "<p>Conan: Hall of Volta is a 1984 action-platform computer game, designed by Eric Robinson and Eric Parker, and published by Datasoft. It is based on the character Conan created by Robert E. Howard.</p>\n<p>Released in 1984, the game's launch coincided with the debut of the sequel to the 1984 feature film Conan the Destroyer. The game's box featured a painting of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the muscle-bound warrior with his new costume for Destroyer. Despite this attempted tie-in, the game has little to do with the movie series except that it features the Cimmerian in the title role. This is due to having originally been designed without the Conan tie-in, as a boomerang-throwing game titled Visigoth. One of the screenshots on the back of the packaging is from a prototype version, and shows a boomerang instead of a sword.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6f/f6fe9ea85d1e00f235b25b0c171cec4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Apple II", "Atari 8-bit", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["SE Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Datasoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
