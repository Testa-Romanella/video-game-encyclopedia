During class we were told we could make ramps so when I got the program up and working again\u00a0thats what I did first. The ramp reminded me of a playground slide, so I decided to make it bright yellow and as one of my favorite facets\u00a0of art making\u00a0\u00a0is playing with color palettes, I thought it would be fun to make a pastelized scene.\r\n</p>\n<p>After I had my color palette figured out I continued with the playground theme\u00a0and made the\u00a0blue\u00a0seesaw and from there I let physics guide where I should place an\u00a0object for\u00a0chain reactions to occur.\r\n</p>\n<p>Overall I was really excited with how this project turned out.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T10:39:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/149/1497c450cec4ea29f28d0de8775e02b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nymh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
