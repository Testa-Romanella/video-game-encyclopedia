MFS is very heavy to run in the background (at least for me) so I made a lighter game about train travel. Currently there is only one route but I have 4 more planned. I hope you relax and enjoy! - Harrison<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:25:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01db20848439163e4c529d7a3ff33697.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GreyGhost"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
