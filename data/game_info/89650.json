{"id": 89650, "slug": "ibots", "name": "iBots", "name_original": "iBots", "description": "iBots - an evasion tactics strategy game.<br/><br/>The iBots live on a planet far away. During your space travels you've crash landed on their planet. They are not happy about it. You are not a machine and you are not compatible with their architecture. They see you as a virus so they've put together an army to catch you. Their programming doesn't make them very smart. They can move in any direction but they aren't very good at avoiding obstacles. Also, they get angry easily and when they do they come straight for you ignoring anything in their path.<br/><br/>You must navigate their maze and trick them into running into the walls. Once they touch a wall or another iBot they short circuit and blow up.<br/><br/>iBots is a simple turn-based strategy game. You make a move first and then the iBots will make their move. The cycle repeats until all iBots are destroyed or until they catch you. There are several power-ups that randomly appear in the maze. Power-ups will help you defeat the iBots.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T15:33:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1d4827d326811a8703665288c635ca8.jpg", "website": "http://www.lesbird.com/iBots", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Les Bird"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Les Bird"], "esrb_rating": null}
