In it, a player, who we will call from now on Game Master (GM), will set up and control a game where the other players will have to move around a real-world area specified by the Game Master hiding and trying to eliminate all other players. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>How do I play?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In order to eliminate other players, you have to take a \"snap\" with them in it. This means to take a photo of them and send it to the GM, who will decide whether it is valid or not.</p>\n<p>To take more snaps, you'll have to look for drops, which are sent by the GM, while remaining inside the zone, or you will be eliminated.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I be a GM?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can play as a regular player from this player, but int order to be a Game Master you'll need the full version, which is avaible in the apk you can download from this same page.You can play as a regular player too in the apk.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:31:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d07085d8e2909e2c86456c7173b18408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["NyaGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
