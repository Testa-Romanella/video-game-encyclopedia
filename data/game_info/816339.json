It is the first out of six 3DS entries.</h2>\n<p>*Like the other Corner Shop games, gameplay consists of working in shops with a chosen Tamagotchi partner. When players serve a certain number of customers, Princess Tamako will visit and upgrade the shop. The highest status a shop can upgrade to is the royal status. It contains all the same shops (excluding the two combination shops) and the same soundtrack as the original corner shop game.</p>\n<p>(*Source of Description - &#39;Tamagotchi Fandom Wiki&#39;; &#39;Cho~ricchi!
