You can only train one type of infantry unit at your base.</p>\n<p>The goal is to destroy the alien spaceship on the map.</p><p>The included build is a standard Unity project compiled for the Intel 64-bit architecture for Windows. A WebGL version might be uploaded in the future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T11:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/698/698de59460c4e083eb230d9a1f268f97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lionblade"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
