{"id": 808134, "slug": "blam-unit", "name": "Blam Unit", "name_original": "Blam Unit", "description": "<p>Blam Unit is a game about fighting hordes of ghosts as they enter a perimeter, and defeating all of them to advance. The ghosts change their attack patterns each time, so you never play a level the same way twice. To fight these ghosts, you pick from a pool of attacks and use whichever ones you see fit to get the job done. Unfortunately, the ghosts have some ways of fighting back (other than seriously outnumbering you). These include, but are not limited to: Going really fast, sticking to you, and using magic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T15:32:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/847c1b855e33da96f8d73b7bf2aa0bae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WizBlob"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
