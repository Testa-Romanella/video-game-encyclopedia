The levels take the shape of a gigantic circle. The station map is procedurally generated on each playthrough, with floors that are actually curved. Because of its circular shape, if you run far enough in one direction, you will end up back where you started.<br/><br/>Because the station spins to generate gravity, the closer you get to the center, the less the gravity affects you. The station also has an inner ring that doesn't spin, where you have to navigate by jumping from wall to wall.A control scheme for emergent physical interactions<br/>Because the setting of the game has varying gravity, we leaned into the physical nature of all the interactions<br/><br/>All objects in the game are physics objects. You can pick them up and throw them, so that they tumble along the ground and smash into enemies. You can release a knife in mid-air, it will fly across the room, and slash the wires that power security systems. You can hold a table in front of you to block incoming bullets.<br/><br/>You'll need a new control scheme to do all this, which is why you have the Grabber Arm!<br/><br/>We've given you an arm that lets you pick up items, and wave them above your head in the physical game-space. The arm follows your mouse, and lets you do things not possible in most platformers.<br/><br/>You'll find toys that interact in interesting physical ways. Fans that let you hover in place, bunsen burners to start fires, or acid to melt through walls.What's the matter?<br/>You're an escaped 3D printer with legs. Why did they give you legs? I don't know, we'll have to ask corporate.<br/><br/>Being an appliance comes with some benefits. Consume any object to learn its blueprint, and break down its matter to recharge your matter bar. For instance: what if you need lots of guns, but all you have lying around is a few humans? EASY! Just use that useless biological matter to print out some handy-dandy firearms.<br/><br/>A word of warning: be careful when printing out some of the more complex biological blueprints. CreatorCrate gets them... mostly right.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1e835ce6873b5ffb08c653be59e1995.jpg", "website": "http://creatorcrate.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jori Ryan"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CreatorCrate Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
