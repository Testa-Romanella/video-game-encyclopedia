At the same time you have to keep away from the strange surrounding void, that swallows up smaller masses and backs away from larger ones.<br/><br/>With your carrier you got into this threatening area, where hyperspace reaches into our realm. In order to escape you have to determine your location repeatedly. It's rather simple: leave the carrier, visit some navpoints, land again and move on. But the robots won't let you. So you have to arm against them by gathering and crafting.<br/><br/>The levels consist of crafted regions, which are combined randomly. Items and enemies are also assigned randomly to certain locations. You get used to the levels, but every replay differs, so the game will be able to kill you even after 100 sessions. By the way you can look at Savage Vessels as a spiritual successor to Teleglitch.<br/><br/>Features<ul><li>top down pixel-art<br/></li><li>dynamic field of view<br/></li><li>levels with predefined regions, combined randomly<br/></li><li>crafting weapons and devices<br/></li><li>inertia + collision, based on pixel shapes<br/></li><li>sound with striking Doppler shift<br/></li><li>hard + permadeath</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-31T03:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/694/6943ada0e882ccba45487c00a4d308e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KPas"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KPas"], "esrb_rating": null}
