Take your VR device and wander around our second home. <br/>\r\nWe have modeled our facilities for you to learn a bit more about us and get to know a bit about the projects we carry out. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Move around freely using the controllers from your VR device to teleport or walk around naturally if you have a big room scale available.  <br/>\r\n- Enjoy the wonderful sights of the port from our city and discover an experience very close to reality with some hidden Easter Eggs.<br/>\r\n- Interact with the environment, see what we are working on by checking our computers or take notes with the markers on the whiteboards. <br/>\r\n- Reach the meeting room to play a video of our AR space planner tool on the big screen. Also, use the computer in the VR area to experience our project Indus-VR. Yes! VR inside of VR. <br/>\r\n- Find the playroom and use physics to interact with the environment. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't worry, there is a little tutorial at the beginning and even if you are new to VR experiences, you will get the grip of everything very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you like this experience and also want to show your products or projects in VR to your clients, contact us!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T03:00:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8fa19fc343b3749373a7685fef1d959.jpg", "website": "https://edataconsulting.es/en", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jose Alfonso", "Vicente Mauricio", "Tobias Kammann", "Guillermo Fleitas"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Jose Alfonso"], "esrb_rating": null}
