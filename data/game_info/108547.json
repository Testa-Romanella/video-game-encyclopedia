There is a secret lab in an old building and only a few people know about it. This is where a small group of doctors have come together to work on some innovative ways of treating cancer and you are part of that team! Nobody knows about this secret lab. About the doctors working on this secret mission. To save lives.\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThey have found a new technique for fighting cancer cells: By shrinking physicians, they are able to put them into the patients' bodies and have them go to where the cancer cells are to treat them more efficiently. Once the physicians are inside the body, they only have seven minutes to fight cancer! After 7 minutes, they will turn back into their normal size again. And now YOU are on this mission to go inside the body. Fighting cancer. With the help of an audio transmitter, you are connected to the outside world where doctors will consult you on what to do, how to get to the cells, how to detect cancer cells and how to fight them.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tFor this project, we were able to put together an amazing interdisciplinary team: a biologist, a 3D artist, two programmers and a game designer. Through endless meetings, our biologist Annett K\u00fchnel told us all about how lung cancer cells can be detected and treated and how it actually looks like once you are inside the body. Using her information, our 3D artist \r\n\tJens Brandenburg was able to build the 3D models in a believable way and based on that information, our game designer Marcus B\u00f6sch was able to focus on the narrative. What is the story exactly? What levels are there? How many options are there for several levels? The two programmers, Stephan Gensch and Ronny Esterluss, worked on gesture detection, navigation and setting up the scenes.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62a/62a7feb646aef6dd744a5194ef453a7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["vromega"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
