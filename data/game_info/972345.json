{"id": 972345, "slug": "true-dice-roller", "name": "True Dice Roller", "name_original": "True Dice Roller", "description": "Perfect for tabletop RPGs and board games alike.  True Dice Roller offers the best of two worlds: it combines the convenience and automated math of a digital dice roller with the fun and realistic feel of rolling actual dice.<h3>Basic Features</h3><strong>Better than Real Dice.</strong>  Dice results are based on actual physics and not computer generated numbers, which never feel as trustworthy as physical dice. Unlike real dice, TDR dice are mathematically perfectly balanced, no salt water testing required!<br/><br/><strong>Fast and Intuitive. </strong> TDR is designed to be extremely fast as well as user friendly.  It\u2019s at least as fast and intuitive as rolling real dice in a real dice tray.<br/><br/><strong>Auto Math.</strong>  Automatically adds dice results and additional modifiers are a button press away.  Enjoy rolling physical dice without the mental math (unless you like the mental math).<br/><br/><strong>True Materials and Sounds.</strong>  Realistic, hand recorded sound effects and altered physics based on material, such as glass, plastic or metal.  <br/><br/><strong>Widely Compatible.</strong>  Show the sum of all rolled dice or show each dice result separately based on your needs, making TDR compatible with any tabletop game that uses standard dice (d20s, d6s, d10s, percentile dice, etc).  This includes classics like D&amp;D as well as newer games like Candela Obscura or Blades in the Dark.<br/><br/><strong>60+ Dice Sets.</strong>  A vast array of dice sets from colored plastic to polished obsidian to solid gold.  Place and roll unlimited copies of dice you own.  Four dice sets are included for free, others can be purchased for significantly less than dice sets in real life.  Be a dice goblin on the cheap!<h3>Advanced Features</h3><strong>Custom Dice Templates. </strong> Arrange and save the placement and configuration of your dice inside your virtual dice tray, making it easy to use different templates for different occasions, or to quickly reset and reorganize your dice with the push of a button.<br/><br/><strong>Fast Dice Calculator. </strong> An advanced tool for GMs.  For maximum speed, use a digital-only dice calculator that can roll and add huge numbers of dice (if you need 100d6 damage, for example), or roll up to 50 checks against a target number at once (in case of needlessly large numbers of enemies or attacks).  Numpad inputs make for extremely fluid usage.  Also, you can roll nonstandard dice types, such as a d3 or a d500, useful for funky dice or large rollable charts.<br/><br/><strong>Dice Analytics. </strong> See if a specific die really is only rolling low or high.  Display graphs and averages data for any die you\u2019ve placed in your dice tray.  Useful as an educational tool or to learn which dice have really betrayed you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T10:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5ef7a10d61c9437152d20a6451ab2916.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MZero Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["MZero Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
