Everyone's buzzing, the lights flashing and your favourite tune is playing from the wireless speakers. You're displaying your smooth moves on the dance floor... when suddenly the music cuts out. What comes next is the most horrifying noise you've ever experienced. This is music?! Your groove is totally thrown off and you furiously storm back over to the speakers, connect your Bluetooth and start your song up again. Except three other people are all thinking and doing the exact same. You just don't know who or where.</p><p>Inspired by Hidden in Plain Sight, Re-Pair Party is a game about letting loose to your jams while trying to spot others who are doing the same and ruining your fun. Move to a speaker and start your song; then make your way to the dance floor to rock out. But be careful: if another player picks you out from the crowd, they might manage to give you the boot and end your night prematurely. Of course, you have the same power if you manage to spot someone suspicious...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:43:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/327/327727cd1a373ff2e4d4e2b18a60b7c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Lott"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
