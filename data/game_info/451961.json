{"id": 451961, "slug": "who-dunnit", "name": "Who dunnit?", "name_original": "Who dunnit?", "description": "<p>Who dunnit? is a detective game where you have to figure out who did it based on a lineup of innocents and suspects.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>You start by gethering information. You will look for suspects by hitting the 'Find more Suspects' button. You will then be presented with a suspect, which will either be Suspicious or Innocent. Keep finding more suspects to determine who did it!</p>\r\nSuspicous\r\n<p>When someone is Suspicious, it means that at least one trait (person type; Man/Woman/Robot/Zombie, Clothing Color\u00a0(Red/Blue/Green/Yellow, or Weapon (Pistol, Knife, Bat, Poison) matches with the Guilty party.</p>\n\r\nInnocent\r\n<p>Someone is innocent when none of the traits match.</p>\n\r\nIdentifying the guilty party\r\n<p>Once you have a list of suspects and innocents, you can determine who did it.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>As you can see from the example above, it was not a robot, they didn't wear yellow clothes and the weapon was not a knife. (Yellow Robot with Knife is innocent).</p>\n<p>If you take this into account and look at the suspects, you can distill who actually did it.</p>\n<p>See the woman in yellow holding the knife? We know the guilty party didn't wear yellow and didn't use a knife, so the only reason why that person can be a suspect, is because the guilty party is a woman.</p>\n<p>So, we know the guilty party is a woman, not wearing yellow and not using a knife. So, if we look at the yellow zombie holding a gun, the only reason he can be a suspect, is because he has a gun, because the guilty party was a woman, not a zombie and not wearing yellow.</p>\n<p>So, by now we know it's a woman with a gun, but what color of clothing did she wear? For that, we look at the men. Two men are holding a gun, explaining why they are suspicious, but there is also a man holding a bat. We know it's not a man and not a bat, so the reason he's suspicious, is that he is wearing blue.</p>\n<p>And there we have our answer: a <strong>Woman</strong> in <strong>Blue</strong> using a <strong>Gun</strong>.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p>Please let me know how you like the game. I have played this a ton with my 6-year old daughter and she loves it.</p>\r\nFuture\r\n<p>This is the first public version of the game where it's fully playable. There are plans to add a tutorial to showcase how the game works, and I plan to add multiplayer functionality.</p>\n<p>I currently only have a Windows build available, but the game will come to iOS and Android soon as well.</p>\r\nKenney<p>The characters used in the game are adaptations from Kenney's great public domain assets. I've used affinity designer to create 4-colored outfits for his characters and they are the star of the game.
