The monsters you control are small and weak, so direct confrontation is out of the question. They've been hiding for some time now, but there's no telling how much longer they will be safe for. They need to flee from this place! But they cannot make it out alone, the two monsters need to make use of their unique abilities to get out together and find a safe space free from humans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <br/><br/>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left and Right Arrow Keys</strong> to move Crabbert side to side.</p>\n<p><strong>Up Arrow Key </strong>to jump with Crabbert (x2)</p>\n<p><strong>Down Arrow Key</strong> to interact with objects with Crabbert</p>\n<p><strong>A and D</strong> to move side to side with Tenti</p>\n<p><strong>W and A\u00a0 or D</strong> alongside an object to climb up said object with Tenti</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> to interact with objects with Tenti</p>\n<p><strong>S</strong> to switch to squish mode with Tenti (and unsquish)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Programmers</em></p>\n<p>Darong Li</p>\n<p>Yuanzheng Ji (Steven)</p>\n\n<p><em>Artists<br/></em></p>\n<p>Annika Kennedy</p>\n<p>Sadie Hower</p>\n\n<p><em>SFX<br/></em></p>\n<p>Annika Kennedy</p>\n\n<p><em>Music</em></p>\n<p>Sadie Hower<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T17:27:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb48a3e907e260d9d470cf5a2d8003ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Annika Kennedy", "yokijyfr", "SadieHower", "dli97"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
