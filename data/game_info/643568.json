Naturally, his approach is much more focused than Saihara\u2019s and his acting skills are riiight for the job.</p>\n<p>This is Amami Rantaro\u2019s Love Hotel event, though much longer and with a lot of fun deviations thanks to Ouma\u2019s ways to play it out!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u265a\u00a0Reminder that the game is 18+, much like V3 and the canon Love Hotel, wiiiith something extra if you get the best ending.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u265a\u00a0The play time is about 1 hr per full run, 2 hrs to try more options. A small VN!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u265a\u00a0Also, the game is silent, so I strongly recommend V3\u2019s \u201cCool Morning (Extended)\u201d as you play.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing our first independent fangame release!!\r\n</p>\n<p>Script, character artwork and programming by:\r\n</p>\n<p>top_shinji @ twitter (NSFW account)\r\n</p>\n<p>gold-pavilion @ tumblr\r\n</p>\n<p>With graphic design and background artwork by:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>hornyantagonist @ twitter (NSFW account)\r\n</p>\n<p>anantagonist @ tumblr\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T04:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e415f51e95472fe2be1f41e9ce3a524.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Koutei NSFW"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
