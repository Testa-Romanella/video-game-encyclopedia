Be careful not to hit a braced box with the other one, as it still can be moved by collisions!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Small Box:<br/><strong>A/D</strong> - move left/right<br/><strong>W</strong> - jump (hold to jump higher)<br/><strong>S</strong> - jump down off a platform<br/><strong>1</strong> - brace/unbrace (when on a platform/floor)</p>\n<p>Large Box:<br/><strong>Left/Right</strong> - move left/right<br/><strong>Up</strong> - jump (hold to jump higher)<br/><strong>Down</strong> - jump down off a platform<br/><strong>2</strong> - brace/unbrace (when on a platform/floor)</p>\n<p>Rope:<br/><strong>Left Ctrl</strong> - shorten the rope<br/><strong>Space</strong> - lengthen the rope</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:33:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a3c4638e76e7370288260a3fe9ebda3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lucas Stark"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
