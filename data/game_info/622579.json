We are quickly improving the game to prepare for a release in Summer 2021! All Beta Testers will retain their accounts and all cards/cosmetic items when Fatal Core goes live.<br/><br/><strong>WHAT IS FATAL CORE AND WHY DO I CARE?</strong><br/>Fatal Core is a Trading Card Game. It is also an attempt at a small, quiet revolution in gaming.<br/><br/>The purpose of a game is to serve the player. Many modern-day online games have veered sharply away from this purpose, seeking only to become an efficient source of revenue. Conflicts of interest arise between developers and players, as rare items and enjoyable experiences are locked behind paywalls. Instead of engaging with the players directly, changes are driven by thousands of data points they unwittingly leave behind.<br/><br/>Fatal Core aims to be the first major TCG that is 100% free of purchases. We hope to be able to support the game entirely through crowd-funding, rewarding each player when goals are met \u2014 whether that player was able to make a donation or not. This means that every card and cosmetic item in Fatal Core must be earned through play. It means that competitive play remains pure. Most importantly, it means that the players are in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to the development of the game. If you talk, we will listen!<br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/>Fatal Core\u2019s gameplay is refreshingly unique. Both players take their turn simultaneously, playing one card per turn out of a mostly open hand. This gives both players great insight into their opponent\u2019s strategy, leading to tense mind-games and graceful counter-plays!<br/><br/>Players will assume the role of one of 6 Lead Characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and special cards. Creatures are played onto a 3x2 board filled with bonuses and penalties that give each creature an unprecedented amount of flexibility. While creatures stay on the board and attack your opponent directly each turn, spells can also be played for a powerful one-time effect.<br/><br/>Deck-building limits the number of powerful cards each opponent can put into their 18 card deck. A large collection is not needed for competitive play. Players can face powerful AI opponents, lovingly designed PvE content, and of course, each other.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>LEAVE YOUR WALLET AT HOME!
