Each orer asks for a type of fish, and how to prepare it. You'll need to dive into the ocean to catch the fish, then use the stove to make 'm just right. Cooking takes time, but be careful not to burn anything. Place finished dishes on one of the two counters on the left. As soon as the contents of that counter match a order, that order is served out.</p>\n<p>Scuba can carry only 1 thing. If you need a place to put that down and grab something else, use the countertop at the right. If you have cooked something that wasn't ordered, you can always throw it away in the trashcan outside.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move using either WSAD or arrow keys. Interact with spacebar.
