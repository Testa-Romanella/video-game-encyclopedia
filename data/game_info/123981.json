The goal is to simply wander around and enjoy the sights.</p><p><strong>This was my first solo 3D game.</strong> I made it in about 3 weeks in May, 2016 for a uni assignment. I was heavily inspired by experimental games such as <em>Bernband</em> and wanted to create something similar. It is far from perfect, but I learned a lot from it and decided I'd share it. I think I've improved a lot since I made this :)</p><p>I hope you enjoy it anyway haha</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b2/3b27eb1f30ec69a378c5d77493f7b38d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Olivia Haines"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
