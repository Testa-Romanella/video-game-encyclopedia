You start with 500 hearts and if you get 1000 hearts, you win. If you reach 0, you lose. You collect hearts by either trusting someone or rejecting them (e or r keys). If you reject an innocent person, you lose the hearts they offered. If you trust an innocent person, you get the offered amount of hearts. If you reject a guilty person, you gain the hearts they offered, but if you trust a guilty person, you lose the hearts they offered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This game fits with the theme, \"Trust No One,\" because trusting no one is actually a good strategy for this game. Though it might not be the best strategy, it is still a good option because happier people (displayed by their color \u2013\u00a0use faces at the bottom of your screen for reference),\u00a0offer less hearts than the\u00a0people who are more depressed. But remember, the depressed people will more likely be guilty. If you're running out of hearts, you could take a risk and trust the depressed. Maybe, just maybe they will be innocent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I had a lot of fun making this game and I hope you will have a lot of fun playing it.
