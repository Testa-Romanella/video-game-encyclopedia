You will be running from enemies, jumping over bottomless pits, dodging red lunging spikes, balancing on small floating blocks and pillars, and timing jumps just right to land on moving platforms. Sounds simple enough, right? That's where you're wrong. Only a determined, skilled few can make it to the end of the game. It may be a simple platformer, but don't let that fool you, there is only one difficulty setting: Nightmare Mode.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat's not all. This game will be constantly updated and upgraded. This isn't even CLOSE to its final form! New features and game mechanics like speed-running leaderboards, combat systems, an ever-diverse array of enemies, better graphics and much more will be constantly added to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- PRECISION PLATFORMER<br/>\r\n- MINIMALIST<br/>\r\n- NIGHTMARE MODE<br/>\r\n- DROP PLATFORMS, FLOATING BLOCKS, FLOATING PILLARS, BOUNCE PLATFORMS, MOVING PLATFORMS<br/>\r\n- AI CHASING ENEMY, MOVING SPIKES, SPIKE BLOCKS, BOTTOMLESS PITS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* FUTURE FEATURES<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- SPEEDRUNNING LEADERBOARDS<br/>\r\n- COMBAT SYSTEM<br/>\r\n- MORE DIVERSE ENEMIES<br/>\r\n- BETTER GRAPHICS<br/>\r\n- AND MORE!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* CONTROLS<br/>\r\n'Left' and 'Right' arrow keys (Or 'A' and 'D' Keys) to move back and forth.<br/>\r\n'Spacebar' to jump.<br/>\r\n'M' to toggle music on and off.<br/>\r\n'Z' to access cursor (only on the menu).<br/>\r\n'P' to return to the main menu.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-24T07:22:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bfff0b6060d9d5c610a2fb1f9ac39bc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Osratti Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Osratti Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
