These chunks are separate from each other and were tested multiple times to guarantee possibility of going through them. This makes for an endless runner that becomes more frantic as time passes.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Happy:</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Instead of a lifebar, you get a happiness meter that decreases as you perform poorly. This meter also comes along with portraits of the player to visually demonstrate the current emotional state of the character.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Hyperactive:</strong>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>The hyperactive criteria is used as a form of punishment, represented by the existence of the caffeine meter. When coffee is spilled, the caffeine meter rises increasing the speed of the game. This makes it harder to go through the obstacles and gives everything a hyperactive look.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Chiptune:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>The game features chiptune music that adheres to the limitations of the NES for authenticity.\u00a0This means the sound effects take a similar approach to fit it better. Both of these facts are then rounded up by the pixel art style used throughout the game, with a fresh spin of HD elements for a stylish UI.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Except for font, everything including art, sound and programming was made by me during the Jam period.</em></p>\n<p><em>Font is HP Simplified.</em></p>\n<p><em>NPC design by\u00a0ArriveMedi, delivered to me in\u00a0this image.</em></p>\n<p><em>(Due to time constraints, the twins didn't make it in, sadly.)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/273/27380893a7f5c0bb53e61dc5202a4fe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThanielPIN"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
