Right this way: Source Code</p>\n<p>Skeledungeon is pretty much your standard dungeon game; dungeons are randomly generated, and are filled with enemies, loot, and the elusive exit to the next dungeon. Make it through four dungeons and you win. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to collect the random bones &amp; guns the baddies drop along the way.</p>\n<p>You can grab a friend for this one, since we have <strong>local multiplayer</strong> support! Just plug in a second controller and you\u2019re good to go.</p>\n<p>Speaking of <strong>controllers</strong>, we support those too! In fact, we strongly recommend you play with a controller, since controller gameplay has one absolutely revolutionary feature the keyboard users sadly won\u2019t get to experience: aiming. If you don\u2019t have a controller, that\u2019s fine, because you can still play the game just fine with a keyboard. No mouse is necessary! Oh, and you might want to press F11/Start to get into fullscreen, since it can be a bit hard to see the tiny screen.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1d382bed75e464d19a0599da1479327.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["atoms118"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
