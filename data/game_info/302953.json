These include lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking, or shaking of arms and legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. IMMEDIATELY STOP PLAYING AND CONSULT A DOCTOR IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe risk of photosensitive epilepic seizures may be reduced by taking the following steps:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n \u2022 Play in a well lit room.<br/>\r\n \u2022 Do not play if you are drowsy or fatigued.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69f40d906048ccbcf58705922685a0c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Devils Advocate Gaming"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Devils Advocate Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
