I figured that the strategy elements from those games would be exciting to blend with a MineSweeper format; something that may be familiar enough to most people, but novel enough to challenge new players.  My aim was to create something casual and laid-back, while simultaneously appealing to more intense, competitive individuals who are seeking to improve their skills.<br/><br/>That being said, this is my first foray into game development.  I'm a systems engineer by trade, and have never worked to build a video game (let alone a competitive online multiplayer one).  However, after tinkering around in Unity (and several false-starts), BOMTILES slowly began to take shape.  Before I knew it, my close friends were helping me test the game, giving me balance suggestions and other valuable feedback (thanks, guys!).<br/><br/>The next step is to get even more feedback from <strong>YOU!</strong><br/><br/>If you decide to purchase, I encourage you to hop into our Community Forums and post ideas, suggestions, and any issues you may experience with the game.  I want BOMTILES to be a constantly evolving, community-driven title, and I'm very receptive to suggestions and constructive criticism.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope you enjoy playing BOMTILES as much as my friends and I do!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T04:29:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e9/9e98988ae84089922eaa61a606a8184f.jpg", "website": "https://bomtiles.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["John Munzo"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["John Munzo"], "esrb_rating": null}
