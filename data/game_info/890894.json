(Pun Intended)<br/><br/>--How To Play--<br/><br/>At random times Quick Time Event buttons will appear. You must click these buttons to make the Arachnophobic Skeleton blow the Spider back up, if you miss the Spider will gain a speed boost and if it gets to the Skeleton, it's game over.<br/><br/>The game gets progressively harder the longer you go on so see how long you can keep that nasty Spider away from the poor Skeleton!<br/><br/>--Disclaimer--<br/><br/>This is my second ever Game Jam, so I apologize if you come over any bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T13:03:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5f/a5fe113de90322b2259c1b9c25cc8a76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beanie Bongle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
