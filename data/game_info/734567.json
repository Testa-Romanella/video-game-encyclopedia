Its protagonist, Little Drone, is a robot whose task is to repair a seemingly derelict frigate called Pan\u2019s Flight to ensure that it can reach its final destination. Little Drone must go through each of the critical units of the frigate and repair them by completing puzzles that will see it move between the Realspace and the Cyberspace. The two critical units, Power Core and the Life Support Unit, have been rendered inoperable in different ways by the frigate\u2019s on-board AI, WENDEE. As part of WENDEE\u2019s robotic crew, Little Drone is perfectly suited to undo the damage that WENDEE has done. Will Little Drone succeed? Or will WENDEE convince it to see reason?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made in less than 10 days for the Global Game Jam 2022.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Remon Ramy<br/>Game Director &amp; Lead Game Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Cesar \"Chechi\" Sanchez Revuelta<br/>Lead Producer\r\n</p>\n<p>Cem Ertekin\u00a0<br/>Creative Lead\r\n</p>\n<p>Chie Andersen\u00a0<br/>Lead 3D Game Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Abdessamed Itim\u00a0<br/>3D Game Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Bassem Hallal<br/>3D Game Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Lionel \"Onygox\" Miele-Herndon<br/>Game Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Luke Seymour<br/>\u00a0Level Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Tingjun Cai<br/>Level Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Mohamed Elhady<br/>Lead UX Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Sayed Abdelaal<br/>UX Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Ahmed Fahmy<br/>UX Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Matthew Campbell<br/>Captain Sirelis\r\n</p>\n<p>Meredith Nudo\u00a0<br/>Wendee\r\n</p>\n<p>Mohamed Karaman\u00a0<br/>Technical Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Wayne Messam II<br/>Sound Effect Artist Lead &amp; Composer</p>\n<p>Ray Miller\u00a0<br/>Composer\r\n</p>\n<p>Andrew Labelle<br/>QA Tester\r\n</p>\n<p>Hacked Font by David Libeau<br/>http://bit.ly/WatchDogsFont\u00a0under CC-BY 4.0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T11:22:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/684/684b7cf8923401f9fbac594909563423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Onygox", "WMII", "Cem_Ertekin", "chie_ander", "Remon Ramy", "Tingjun", "MKaraman", "digitalechoes", "humanoid_synth", "Chechi0"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
