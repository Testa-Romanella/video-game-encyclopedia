Coming soon to a museum near you!</p>\n<p>** The Monsterverse is not online yet, so for now we ask you to share your creations privately with your friends, or maybe on Twitter with the hashtag #monsters2021 - it is as close as we get for now.</p>\n<p>*** The concept of showing the source of the materials used is still important to us, but we didn't get around to implementing it. We have all the sources of the original pieces, and we plan to show for every monster which parts were used, so people can remix them and learn about art in the process.</p>\n\n\n<p>This prototype was made for<strong>\u00a0the A MAZE.
