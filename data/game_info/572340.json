Don't be fooled by Markov chain generated fake pokemon names.</p>\n<p>For a recent project, I wrote a Markov Chain based Pokemon name generator which is suprisingly effective. The generator was originally written for my 7DRL project, MonsteRL</p>\n\n<p>In Pokemon: Real or Markov you will be presented with 10 questions. In each question you'll have to pick the real Pokemon name out of 2 choices.</p>\n<p>In the regular game you'll get handpicked real and Markov options for a consistent experience. I recommend you play it first.</p>\n<p>In the Bonus Round, real Pokemon names are picked at random and Markov names are generated on the fly. Different every time!</p>\n<p>Pokemon and real Pokemon names belong to Nintendo/Game Freak/The Pokemon Company. Pls don't sue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:30:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99b211982ea46954c62673099bf6209a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mrhthepie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
