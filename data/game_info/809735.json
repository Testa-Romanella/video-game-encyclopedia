You use a tool known as the Velocitor Model - 1 to push and pull yourself through the air. You'll also get the chance to use a tool known as the Sidekick, which is a laser pistol that can break barriers blocking your way and can also be used to kill things too.</p>\n<p>Chapter One will release first and depending on how much people play/like it, I'll work on Chapter Two! Chapter One is only a taster of what could potentially come in future chapters. I plan to make five chapters if you guys enjoy!</p>\n<p>Also do let me know if you have any issues! I already do plan to make a patch update adding &amp; probably\u00a0changing a few things.</p>\r\nBasic Controls:\r\n<p>WASD = Movement</p>\n<p>LMB = Interact</p>\n<p>LShift = Sprint</p>\n<p>Esc = Pause</p>\r\nTool Controls:\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic Credits:\r\n<p>The jazz music heard in the Downes Labs Instructional Video and at the beginning of Chapter One is \"Night in Venice\" by Kevin MacLeod.</p>\n<p>The rest of the music in the game including the menu theme, ambient music, &amp; chase music is made specifically for PPT by Shan Soley.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T10:46:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/eba90586a6940150e4459a9a99d252d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lachlan Shelton"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
