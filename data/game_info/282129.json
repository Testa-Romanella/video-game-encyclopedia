You can read more about the overall project's concept here.</em></p>\n<em>\n<p>Taking place from the point of view of Olivia 'Sombra' Calomar, <em>Red Wheelbarrow </em>is a chat-based, hacker-themed mini story I made to experiment with the Twine format. It serves as a side story for AR readers but also functions as an introduction to the multi-work AU the story is set in.</p>\n</em><p><em>Arcadian Rhythms </em>is a very involved fiction project I've been working on for the past year now. A supernatural crime-drama that's sort of like <em>The Wolf Among Us </em>(only with video game characters instead of fairy tales), it is set in an original world that blends elements from a variety of different video games, specifically more modern ones. <br/>I have quite a good chunk of it written and in the early new year, I plan on rolling out 'Season 1,' distributing each new 'episode' on a weekly schedule. The story is written in such a way that one with <em>no knowledge </em>of any franchise represented will still be able to follow along, but knowledge of the source material will create potentially interesting side-effects.<br/><br/>If you want to support me, a donation of $2 will give you access to the first three \"episodes\" of the written prose story in their current \"beta-reader\" form. (but the actual Twine program is completely free to download, and I am not in any way selling a product)<br/></p>\n<p>In case you want an idea of what you're getting into with this Twine story,<br/><em>Red Wheelbarrow </em>features AU interpretations of:</p>\n<p>Olivia <strong>(</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>)</strong> Calomar from <em>Overwatch.<br/></em>Alma <strong>(</strong><strong>x</strong><strong>X</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>X</strong><strong>x</strong><strong>)</strong> Armas from <em>VA-11 HALL-A.<br/></em>Itaru <strong>(</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>)</strong> Hashida from <em>Steins;Gate.<br/></em>Sandra <strong>(</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>U</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>)</strong> from <em>Pyre.<br/></em>Futaba <strong>(</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>)</strong> Sakura from <em>Persona 5.<br/></em>Marine <strong>(</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>J</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>)</strong> Iida from <em>Splatoon 2<br/>(and guest appearances! ;D )<br/></em></p>\n<p>You can follow updates on this project on its official Tumblr blog, @Arcadian-Rhythms.
