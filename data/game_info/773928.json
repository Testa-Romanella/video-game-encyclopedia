No Audio yet, and only the playable scene in the build (Main Menu button for example doesn't do anything, as the Menu wasn't included in this build. Finishing the run will also only pause game instead of taking you to a scoreboard as planned).</p>\n<p>WASD to move, space to Jump, Shift to Sprint (you'll want to sprint most of the time). ESC for pause menu.<br/><br/>Known issues:</p>\n<p>- Restarting the level sometimes bugs the timer for the duration of initial countdown (will start and run normally after)</p>\n<p>- Pausing/Resuming the game overrides countdown at start and stop at the finish.</p>\n<p>- There's an annoying gap between the middle section and the frame of the wall elements.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T18:07:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e5/3e5c1db64f29210463cf59445755099a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pettergames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
