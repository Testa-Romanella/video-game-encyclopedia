It is a triangular figure consisting of ten points arranged in four rows: one, two, three, and four points in each row. This is a local two player game inspired by the mystical tetractys symbol.</p>\n<p>Each turn a player captures a node, triangle, or row of lines. The game ends when all the triangles have been captured. The player with the most points wins.\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>Nodes = 3\r\n </li><li>Triangles = 2\r\n </li><li>Lines = 1\r\n </li></ul>\n<p>Selecting a triangle will capture the triangle and the surrounding nodes that have not been fortified.\r\n </p>\n<p>Selecting an individual node fortifies it. Once a node is fortified, its color cannot be switched.\r\n </p>\n<p>Lines and unfortified nodes can be captured using the outer dashes. Dashes will vanish once used. (Dashes have no value.)\r\n </p>\n<p>The current scores are displayed on the right side of the screen.
