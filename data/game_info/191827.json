As <br/>one of the only survivors you learned how to hide and live a normal life<br/> under humans. One day you were forced to use your super powers to <br/>rescue the life of your child Angela and your wife Naomi from a Tornado <br/>which hit your house. Few hours later you were tracked by the ISD <br/>(International Security Department) which sent RW's (Red Walkers) to <br/>find you so you needed to escape from your homeless family.</p>\n<p><strong>READ ME</strong><br/>A developer note: I\u00b4m currently working in my free time on <strong>Project PVP</strong> and really need your feedback. I created one tutorial level with few basic features but if you <br/>have any good ideas or if you think I should work on that as main part and develop the final game of that idea, plseae support this project.<strong> Ideas, Suggestion, Donations, Posts on your Social Accounts</strong> everything what makes this vision become true is really welcome.<br/></p>\n<p>The orginal plan is it to focus on <strong>Multiplayer 1on1, 2on2 and 3on3</strong> matches where you will fight against others and rank up in season based <strong>ladder boards</strong>.<br/><br/>A story would be defintely possible, but this is really related to you and what you would prefer more, because doing Multiplayer + Singleplayer takes a lot of time what is unrealistic to archieve as\u00a0 a single person.</p>\n<p>So please leave some comments, opinions, ideas and whatever you think. I will try to catch the best ideas into the concept of the game. <br/></p>\n<p>For your information: While developing I will release also constantly new versions, so you can see the progress with the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a76/a7621241c2686044d2a00e9f52280aae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blackshit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
