{"id": 974391, "slug": "the-last-66-days", "name": "The Last 66 Days", "name_original": "The Last 66 Days", "description": "The Last 66 Days is a visual novel based on events experienced by me, an indie game developer. In the game, you assist the protagonist, Anna, in her quest to find out the reason why \"he\" left in the 66 days left, by reviewing \"her\" and \"his\" story. Every choice you make can affect the course of the story and lead to different results for Anna and \"him\". It doesn't take a lot of time to experience the game, so if you find the game too short for your liking, even if you get a refund through Steam, I thank you for taking the time to learn about and experience my story. ^_^<h3>A letter from the protagonist to the player</h3>Dear:<br/><br/>Greetings!<br/>I don't know where you are reading this letter, but I know you must be the one destined to help me. My name is Anna and I am writing to you to ask you for something. Maybe because I crossed the \"line\", or for some other reason, my crush, he said he would stop contacting me in 66 days - that's New Year's Day 2024. I've asked him why, but he's refused to tell me why. It's really, really hard for me right now, not only will he be there for me when I'm sad, but he's also helped me a lot. So, I really don't want to lose him. I know that your dimension is higher than ours, so I've made a \"game\" of our world that you can open at any time to help me make decisions.<br/>I know it may be a daunting task, but as long as there is a glimmer of hope, I will not give up. I have a vague idea of what I should do, but I'm having a hard time making a decision and sometimes I don't know what to do when I am faced with a problem. Therefore, I need you to help me make a decision. Please don't worry, our world is just a \"game\" for you, you can always read our story and start over. This \"game\" contains all the stories between me and him. If you want, you can treat it like a novel and just make decisions for me once in a while. It won't be difficult, and it won't take up much of your time. I would appreciate it if you would help me out.<br/>Lastly, thank you for reading this, and I wish you and the one destined for you having a long and prosperous life!<br/><br/>Sincerely.<br/>Bow!<br/><br/>Anna<br/>10/27/2023<h3>Credits</h3>Planner: Xiran<br/>Story: Xiran, ClF3<br/>Programming: Xiran<br/>Music: FreeSound Library, Mixkit Library<br/>Graphics: Zhang Zhehao, Zhangyuyang, Vectonauta<br/>Producer: Next Playground<br/>Special Thanks: ClF3<br/>Made with WebGAL", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-01T05:33:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/661/661df1c456c9bb0021b3b91454b64b56.jpg", "website": "https://thelast66days.next-playground.com.cn/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u66e6\u5189"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Next Playground"], "esrb_rating": null}
