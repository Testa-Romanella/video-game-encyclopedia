Dare to go deeper into the wild where no fisherman has gone before and find the biggest catches. All maps are playable both in single player and multiplayer modes.<br/><br/>Finding the best fishing spots by learning the depth maps and bottom topology of each location is fun, but requires patience and dedication. Nothing wins the expectation of finding the best location or catching the biggest fish from each lake.<br/><br/>The real excitement starts when it is time to throw fishing lines into the water and start fishing! The right equipment for right conditions are as essential as is mastering the location. The realistic fish behavior system, fish AI and fish swarms for almost 30 fish species makes this game a lifelike fishing experience. Fishing gear can be chosen from a wide selection of different jigs, rods, augers and baits. A perfect combination of equipment for different species depends on the season, but especially weather and daytime conditions. Controlling a rod and a jig in the water in a right way and at the right depth in Ice Lakes is a skill of its own. Rod and jig physics guarantees that fish react authentically to player's actions. <br/><br/>Fishing independently without time limits or competitors makes Ice Lakes a relaxing game to play and tune your fishing skills in the comfort of your home. On the other hand, lengthy tournaments and very customizable single competitions will test the player's skills and knowledge, but will reward them with new equipment and limitless fame.Future developmentAfter the release the development of Ice Lakes will continue and is improved based on the wishes of the community. Moreover, the game will get free content updates including more maps, game modes, fish species, equipment and more.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:05:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67118045a222337f79b5ac143d61d74.jpeg", "website": "http://iceflake.com/#icelakes", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 348, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 49, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 327, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Iceflake Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Iceflake Studios", "Iceflake Studios Oy"], "esrb_rating": null}
