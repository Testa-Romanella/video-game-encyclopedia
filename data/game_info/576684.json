There are to modes in the game, Quick Game and Campaign.\u00a0The goal of the Quick Game mode\u00a0is to conquer all four corners of the map, hence the name 4Corners.\u00a0The player or players (only local multiplayer on the same computer) each start with one castle in a corner of the map. Every turn each player will get to move all of his/her units once and can also attack once with every unit. As the game progresses players earn gold and can use this gold to build new units or upgrade their castles (increasing income). However, units cost maintenance so you can only have so many units before you start losing gold per turn.\u00a0Once one person has taken the other players castles they will achieve victory.</p>\n<p>The Campaign mode differs greatly from the Quick Game mode.\u00a0The basic story is that you are the king of a kingdom that has recently been losing a war and is in desperate need of a victory. It is your task to lead the kingdom to there first victory and turn the tide of the war. After this first victory there are currently seven more missions to play. Eventually, there will be close to a hundred missions in the campaign.</p>\n\n<p>Attack System:</p>\n<p>When attacking 4Corners simulates rolling dice, the summation of the dice is the amount of damage that will be done.</p>\n<p>The number of dice being rolled changes depending on what types of units are attacking each other.</p>\n\n<p>Attack Scenarios:</p>\n<p>Swordsman attacking Any Unit (except Catapult) :\u00a0(2 dice vs. 2 dice)</p>\n<p>Archer attacking Any Unit (except Archer) : (2 dice vs. 0 dice)</p>\n<p>Archer attacking Archer (2 dice vs. 2 dice)</p>\n<p>Horseman attacking Any Unit (from behind\u00a0except Catapult) : ((2 dice)x3 vs. 1 dice)</p>\n<p>Horseman attacking Any Unit (from infront except Catapult) : (2 dice vs. 2 dice)</p>\n<p>Catapult attacking Castle : ((3 dice)x2 vs. 0 dice)</p>\n<p>Catapult attacking Any Unit (except Castle) : (3 dice vs. 0 dice)</p>\n<p>Castle attacking Any Unit : (3 dice vs. 0 dice)</p>\n<p>Any Unit (except Castle) attacking Catapult : (2 dice vs. 0 dice)</p>\n\n<p>Current Features:</p>\n<p>-Local multiplayer (on the same device)</p>\n<p>-8 Campaign missions</p>\n<p>-4 Unique units (Swordsman, Archer, Horseman, Catapult)</p>\n<p>-Simple AI to play against</p>\n<p>-A store to upgrade the units</p>\n\n<p>Future Features:</p>\n<p>-Multiplayer across multiple devices</p>\n<p>-At least 90 more campaign missions</p>\n<p>-2 New Units (Medic, Pikeman)</p>\n<p>-Better AI</p>\n\n<p>Possible Features (No sure yet):</p>\n<p>-Naval combat (would include more units)</p>\n<p>-Different skins for the units (for instance you could change the look of the catapult to a ballista or some other medieval siege weapon)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T05:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bf/4bff5c2eae39080f3d5d58995fc5c4aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WhiteKnight9801"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
