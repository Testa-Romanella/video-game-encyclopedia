Now I know that my there is not much to do in my game, but I hope to improve what you can do in the game over time. For now, the objective of the game is to push the cube. I like to see which direction the cube goes when I push it at a certain angle. This is a very neat feature because the cube can be pushed in may different ways!</p><p>I wish to reiterate that this is my first video game project, and I have had no previous experience in making video games. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smooth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
