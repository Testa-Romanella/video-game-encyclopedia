(Ha ha, bomb jokes!)</p>\n<p>Bombermals is a game that takes heavy inspiration from the Bomberman series. After playing Super Bomberman R for some time, I wondered to myself if I could create a game that was of similar quality. As of now, all I have is this simple prototype that gets the very basic element of Bomberman down, and has some playable fox boys to go along with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later down the line, I plan to add features to make this stand out from any other Bomberman style game! Feel free to share any ideas you have for this game with me, whether it be playable characters, maps, or features to include into the game! I'm open ears to all feedback for Bombermals!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0f/e0ff14de3f4c6f6db343bdb7ee1f065f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamcat Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
