Not only that, this is a sandbox built for customizability: you can create your own species and customize their behavior, appearance and sound. Yes, their\u00a0sound too! Automata Ecosystem is also built to turn cellular automata into a complete, interactive and evolving\u00a0audiovisual experience.</p>\n<p>You can follow further developments on\u00a0Twitter and\u00a0Discord\u00a0:)<br/></p>\n<p>Created by Giuseppe La Malfa.\u00a0 All rights reserved.</p>\n<p>Logo design by Nadia La Malfa.
