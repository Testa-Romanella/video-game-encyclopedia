Omar is a man whose genetic mutation allowed him to live to be 300 years old. Primarily he had decided to just observe humanity from afar, but seeing the Earth in this state he could no longer just watch, he had to do something to get the planet's state reversed.                          </p>\n<p>                 He decides to join a military organization that has a plan to \u201csave the Earth\u201d: they will use a time machine to be able to go back and stop the heating before it's too late. But because the substance that served as fuel for the machine no longer exists, an interdimensional portal will be used in order to visit other Earths in search of this substance so that they can use the time machine.             \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T13:18:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4ccf321f83c8b9641b2c0e1a35011888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leandro Br\u00e1s"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
