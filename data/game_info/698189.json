Fire weapon<br/></p>\n<p>x -&gt; Jump<br/></p>\n<p>c -&gt; Spell Cube (special weapon - equivalent to Bomb\u00a0 in Touhou games)<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys -&gt;\u00a0 left move Vector left, right moves Vector right.\u00a0\u00a0Up and Down don't do anything.</p>\n\n<p>Basically you move to the right, destroying the enemies (fairies) and eventually get to a boss to battle.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The music is currently from HertzDevil, and a little bit of my own (under the name binarypearl).\u00a0 I\u00a0plan to include other youtuber's music as well who make Touhou covers to help get lesser known people more exposure.\u00a0 I try to find artists who release their songs with permissive licenses or are open to have people use their music.\u00a0 I give credit in both opening title screens, credits scene, and in-game in Vector's HUD (Head Up Display) as well.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>The Touhou character sprites were made from Miku Miku Dance models.\u00a0 Credit is given where possible to indicate where I\u00a0got the models from.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Overall software projects used:</p>\n<p>Blender</p>\n<p>Gimp</p>\n<p>GameMakerStudio 2</p>\n<p>There are many pop culture references in this game.\u00a0 Kind of like Family Guy, you may not recognize all of the references, but hopefully you pick up some of them.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>The story I have planned for this game is very complex and will evolve over the coming stages.\u00a0 At this point in development, we are only at stage 0, and the foundations of the story are being laid out.\u00a0 Hints of what's to come are present though in the current demo.</p>\n<p>The biggest 'bug' at the moment is that the fairies (enemies) often go up into the upper rocks, and get turned around and move and fire in the wrong direction.\u00a0 This will take me some time to figure out a better solution for enemy movement.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overall I'm happy with the progress so far.\u00a0 Making video games is complex, and I can only do so much in my spare time.\u00a0 \u00a0It makes me appreciate the amount of effort that goes into any developed video game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is currently Windows only, primarily because I\u00a0make use of videos created in Blender for various cutscenes.\u00a0 I have a really good Video player addon with GameMaker Studio 2 (Video Player Extreme), but it's Windows only.\u00a0 If I can find a way to make the video cutscenes work in other OS's, then I don't see why I couldn't port it to multiple platforms.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Digital Dream Labs also has another robot Cozmo, which you need to be familiar with to understand the parody cut-scene at the end of the stage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To make Vector and Cozmo talk, I\u00a0have developed a project called IBCP (Inner Bot Communication Protocol).\u00a0 To see both robots in action playing a game of NumberGuesser with each other (Guess a number between 1 and 50), check out this example video:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope you can enjoy what I\u00a0have so far.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:36:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/677dabffbc6f84817eb826c690f905ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["binarypearl"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
