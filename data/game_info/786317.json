{"id": 786317, "slug": "void-strife", "name": "Void Strife", "name_original": "Void Strife", "description": "<p>An Open-World Action game with branching storylines and quests.</p>\n\n<p>In\u00a0<strong>Void Strife</strong>, most quests or actions in the market can drastically change the outcome of the galaxy. One moment, it may be on its way to becoming a peaceful place, but one single misstep will cause massive calamity down the line.</p>\n<p>The factions you can interact with will react to your and other factions' actions, meaning you could technically cause a war to break out between the space hippies\u00a0<strong>Dynasty Roses</strong>\u00a0and the power-hungry\u00a0<strong>Frost Tips</strong>.</p>\n<p>Ranging from rifles that shoot spheres emanating lightning tendrils to bionic laser eyes to the behemoth disruptor beams, you have to pick the right tool for the job.</p>\n<p>Equip special equipment which gives you access to different skills, or equip the mythical artifacts, which tear you apart as you rip through enemies.</p>\n<p>Explore an open-world top-down galaxy, filled with interesting NPCs and enemies to fight.</p>\n<p>Can you find every scattered note log left behind by unhinged pilots?</p>\n<p>Warning - The game is still heavily in development and many features/QoL will be missing and bugs galore. There is not a lot of content in the game just yet.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p><strong>Planets</strong>:\u00a0https://deep-fold.itch.io/pixel-planet-generator\u00a0- Thank you very much Deepfold!</p>\n<p><strong>Parts of the warp sound</strong> -\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\"Scifi Laser Gun Firing\" by TannerSound (https://freesound.org/people/TannerSound/)</p>\n<p>\"Transformers Type SFX 2\" by hykenfreak</p>\n<p>(https://freesound.org/people/hykenfreak/)</p>\n<p><strong>Some equipment in-game</strong>:\u00a0https://pixelcreations.itch.io/16x16-sci-fi-items-and-equipment</p>\n<p><strong>Lab tileset</strong>: https://exceptrea.itch.io/2d-platformer-tileset-laboratory</p>\n<p><strong>Modular weapons</strong>:\u00a0https://zintoki.itch.io/pixwep\u00a0- Absolute godsend, absolute mad lad!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T09:18:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/413/41308ffbce1455a1c9b2189d8931b56b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TriTorus"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
