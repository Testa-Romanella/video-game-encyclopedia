The player has 3 input options: moving left/right (done using WASD or the arrow keys) around the planets,\u00a0 and also jumping (using the space bar).</p>\n<p>The game was programmed by myself using the Godot game engine for the LMOB Beginner's Game Jam #28. Art assets were made by Aaron Randell and myself using GIMP. Didn't have time to implement music or sound effects, unfortunately.</p>\n<p> In the original submission, I forgot to include the .pck file, but this version does include it now, so it should work (although it won't be in time for the game jam, unfortunately). <br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T06:27:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e2/0e29bb0979299b0bd0a59eac47c4dbe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bruhnana"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
