{"id": 717326, "slug": "power-runner-ppkatirow", "name": "Power Runner (ppkatirow)", "name_original": "Power Runner (ppkatirow)", "description": "<p>Power Runner\u00a0is a game that you must try to reach the highest possible score. Of course, as time goes by, the game gets more difficult, but there are also powers that fall from the sky that can be accumulated and will make your game easier. In this way, the difficulty increases but at the same time it is never impossible.</p>\n<p>The controls are:\u00a0the right and left arrows move back and forth, the upper one jumps and the lower one helps you to fall faster.</p>\n<p>Metal obstacles kill, but there is a 20% chance that one of the obstacles is not metal but a red or a green one, which actually do the opposite thing but both are good. Green makes the character bigger, decreases gravity (and increases jumping power), decreases the spawn frequency of obstacles and increases the speed they pass. On the other hand, reds slow down the character, increase gravity, jump strength and spawn frequency of obstacles but slow them down. Both can be staked infinitely, but not simultaneously. Getting a lot of greens helps you to float over the obstacles and be calm about seeing a few of them, while getting a lot of reds will help you have greater accuracy and speed to fall and with the slow obstacles, it will be easier to get around them. These buffs also fall into circles in the sky.</p>\n<p>In addition, circles of energy fall from the sky, which increase the character's speed (can also be accumulated infinitely until death), increase 1 number on the score and make you jump, without spending 1 jump (of the 3 you have).</p>\n<p>The energy circles can also come periodically from the front, in an indissoluble column. However, there are 2 other columns that can come, a pink one, which decreases 1 jump the character can take but increases jump strength and speed and a brown one, which will actually trigger a meteor shower. The green meteors won't kill you, but they will reverse the front and back controls for a while. Also, during the meteor shower, the character can jump 5 times instead of 3 and the obstacles are bigger.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T03:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43f33c0704d115b0d41486732e919aec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ppkatirow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
