{"id": 775855, "slug": "lance-lazor-50-cv-english-glow", "name": "Lance Lazor (5.0) CV English (GLOW)", "name_original": "Lance Lazor (5.0) CV English (GLOW)", "description": "<p>Lance Lazor is a virtual singer and voicebank for the UTAU software. UTAU is voice synthesizing software. It is essentially a plug and play collection of voice recordings that can be tuned and edited down into a virtual voice if you don't have a singer for your music!</p>\n<p>Each voicebank comes in a variety of styles and Languages. The easiest to use for beginners is \"CV JAPANESE\". The following bank, and character is Lance Lazor's ENGLISH CV GLOW. Lance Lazor also has a more natural sounding bank titled \"Lance Lazor CV ENGLISH\" which is Lance's regular 5.0 voice but without the nasal tone that this bank holds.</p>\n<p>Each Voicebank has a character associated with it, which is what Lance Lazor is. Lance Lazor can be used commercially with the purchasing of a license. For full terms as to her commercial use please see this page on her website.</p>\n<p>CV English may sound robotic to the untrained ear. This is because this software is not a natural human singing but rather a compilation of sounds made to sound like someone singing. This natural or uncanny effect will go away rather quickly with repeated listening to UTAUloids which are what the characters/voices for this software are called.</p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Bank</strong>: CV ENGLISH (GLOW)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Oto'r: </strong>Reso-P</p>\n<p><strong>Vocier:</strong> Compulsive Ink/Adam Noizic\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Reclist Credi</strong><strong>t</strong>:\u00a0Restune-P/Rel-English</p>\n<p><strong>Artist:\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Designer: </strong>Adam Snowflake\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Gender:</strong> Genderfluid\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Pronouns</strong>: He/They/She (in any order)\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: AMERICAN ENGLISH</p>\n<p><strong>WikiPage</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>VOCAL RANGE</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Era: </strong>5.0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>18+ Use allowed:\u00a0</strong>Yes permission not required but please age him up if you use him this way</p>\n<p><strong>Commercial use allowed:</strong>\u00a0With purchasing of license<br/></p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab</p>\n<p>INSERT VIDEO OF HER SINGING HERE</p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Tutorial on CV English [sound list and corespondents]\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab</p>\n<p>Lance has merch such as Standees and Posters that you can buy here</p>\n<p>Wallpapers here</p>\n<p>A Patreon Here</p>\n<p>and lastly LINE Stickers here</p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab\r\n</p>\n<p>Lastly Lance's CV GLOW Design is slightly different then his regular design thus the purchasing of this license only refers to that design and voicebank.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00bb\u00bb\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u3000\u2654\u3000\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00ab\u00ab \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T12:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aca/aca4be1e41949671536914c87cef6a48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oron Snowflake"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
