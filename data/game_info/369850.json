Let's do both!\"</p>\n<p>This game was inspired by another runner\u00a0whom I forgot the name.\u00a0 Anyway, I hope you like what I came up with !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T05:22:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b7/2b71be892aca1ba48a0793c5d46adfd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quasar47"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
