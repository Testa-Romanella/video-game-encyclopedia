There will be several questions for you to fill out so I can gain an understanding of how you felt playing my loot box simulator.</p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>You start off with 3 lives, you click on the chest to start the cards rolling and then you can click 'Stop Rolling'. All number and face cards get added to your collection. If you pull a Joker, you lose a live and you can re-roll. Once you have lost all your lives, you are given the chance to \"buy\" more lives or you can reset your collection ('Reset Collection' button).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Disclaimer - this is not about winning, it is about whether or not you are willing to \"buy\" lives to carry on playing without resetting.\u00a0</p><p>I have a google form that would be appreciated if you could fill out while playing or afterwards, that would be great :)\u00a0\u00a0Comments are more than welcome in the comment section below!</p><p>google form link -\u00a0https://forms.gle/3mukPT8fBwXBexNS7</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T06:58:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d99/d9959c95547a4c634eef886734e77493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarcusTurnerBSU"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
