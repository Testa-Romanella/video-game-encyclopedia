We had to do a game on the Black Friday theme and with other contraints like shooting, without movements and random.\u00a0To answer to our constraints, we have decided to create a game in which we have to shoot enemies with random weapons.</em></p>\n<em>Pitch</em>\n<p><em>In the Year, there is one day that shop employees hate, The Black Friday Day! Why? Because during that day people become crazy because of a virus and they need to rob shops. With an ally you need to protect your shop and hide objects to not be fired. For that you need to shoot them and survive that Black Day!</em></p>\n\n<em>How to defend</em>\n<p><em>During the game you'll play against waves of infected people, to defend your shop you only need to play with your mouse and shoot to them. You can unlock a weapon with a random box and your skin change with each weapons.</em></p>\n<p>In the game you have many weapons with different caracteristics. You begin the game with a Desert eagle, it does less damage than other weapons\u00a0 and shoots one bullet by one.</p>\n\n<p>When you shoot at a box you can drop another weapon; it can drop :</p>\n<p>-A famas, his damage is the same as the Desert eagle but his shoots is faster.</p>\n\n<p>-A shotgun, it does the same damage than previous weapons\u00a0 but it shoots six bullets.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>-A grenade, you can throw it and it explodes on infected people in a large zone.</p>\n\n<p>-And last, you have the\u00a0rocket launcher, the bullet explodes when it touches infected people</p>\n\n\r\nOur Team :\r\n<p>That video game was made by :</p>\n<ul><li>Leclercq Damien, Game Design</li><li>Alotounou Amir, Game Design</li><li>Barreyre Baptiste, Programer &amp; Game Design</li><li>Bruneau Vincent, Programer</li><li>Tuil Hugo, Programer</li><li>Limier Eliott, Game Art</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:25:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/252/252d80056ac5f6eadfe0173e1e58a2c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["artichaud"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
