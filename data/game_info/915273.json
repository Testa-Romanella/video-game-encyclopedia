All the player has to do is spend ten seconds exploring each stage of life. Behind each door is a different life choice, perhaps taking the wrong path to death or getting through each stage without incident. Each level represents a different period of life, where the player opens the right door and passes, opens the wrong door and dies in place, and has to go back to the first room to start again. Each level gives the player ten seconds to make a choice, and the time resets at the new level. Remember to treat every 10 seconds with care, and I hope that playing this game will make you appreciate every second of your life more.<p><strong>Operation method:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD controls movement, E controls interaction, shift controls sprint, and ESC controls the menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T07:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaa/aaa74ff60c9a1cfe28ef5da26e7283ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yifan Zhang"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
