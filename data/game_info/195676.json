The idea was to be able to string things together with connections by left and right clicking different objects that can move. This works, but I didn't really come up with any puzzles, it's more just a tutorial level then anything, but shows all of the mechanics I got in. Not sure if rift support is working still, but I only had 5 minutes to upload this, so, I didn't get to test it, not that it would show at the presentation anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Caliber Mengsk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
