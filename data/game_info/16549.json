It was the search for new life that drove this exploration more than anything else, but after hundreds of years it appeared we were alone. <br/><br/>Suddenly that all changed. Without warning our colonies were attacked. An alien force, known as the Constituents of Nothing appeared out of nowhere systematically wiping out our colonized worlds. These aliens were unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 they harnessed the same dark matter to power themselves and their civilization. Our weapons were useless against this new threat. <br/><br/>Soon we discovered pieces of the alien\u2019s destroyed technology could help us create an Anti-Dark Matter particle. This Blue-Energy, named for the color it glowed, stopped the aliens in their tracks. Now mankind must band together, to form an alliance and push back the CoN invasion. We must protect our colonies using Blue-Energy shield generators. Otherwise we face certain extinction. <br/><br/>Previously available on Xbox Live Indie Games!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/0078f9789b3f385650b66fd72552825b.jpg", "website": "http://www.blueshieldalliance.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 98}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brainshape Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BA Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
