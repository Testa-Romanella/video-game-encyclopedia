Be sure to dodge their bullets!</p>\n<p>Missiles - These will explode on contact</p>\n<p>Pin Launcher - These enemies will launch sharp pins in multiple directions\u00a0that will damage your helicopter.</p>\n\n<p>Every time you get hit, you'll lose a life bar. Collect fuel canisters to regain life and keep going!</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>You cannot fly straight into enemies. But by circling around them, they will get caught in your rope! The helicopter will follow the mouse. Alternatively, there is an option to use the arrow keys/WASD for movement.</p>\n<p>Try to get the highest score without getting hit!</p>\n\n<p>Made by McPepic for the Black &amp; White Game Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T15:14:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f66/f66828eeda756a5ac67effdcc496ae9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["McPepic"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
