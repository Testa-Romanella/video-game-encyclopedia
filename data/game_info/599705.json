Whoever hits their opponent gets a point and the round resets. If both players hit each other simultaneously, both get a point.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\r\n</em></p>\r\nActions:\r\n\r\n<p>Walk: You can move by pressing the\u00a0left\u00a0and\u00a0right\u00a0arrow keys.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Dash: You can dash a short distance by pressing a direction and the\u00a0space bar. This will let you move faster than walking but locks their direction for the duration of the dash.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Run: You can run by holding the\u00a0space bar\u00a0after performing a dash. This allows you to move very quickly but may take some time to stop running.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Thrust: You can extend their arm forwards by pressing the \u201cE\u201d button. This allows you to be able to hit the other player without getting too close but can allow their sword to be hit easier.\r\n</em></p>\n\n\n<p><em><em>Lunge: You can lunge forward quickly by pressing the \u201cD\u201d button. This allows you to close the distance fast but doesn\u2019t allow movement during the lunge. You can perform both a thrust and lunge simultaneously with the \u201cR\u201d button.\r\n</em></em></p>\n<p><em><em>\u00a0<em>\n</em></em></em></p>\n<p><em><em><em>Parry: You can hit the opponent\u2019s sword by pressing the \u201cQ\u201d button. The blade is\u00a0Red\u00a0during a parry and Black after being parried. This prevents the opponent\u2019s sword from being able to hit you or parry your blade for a duration. Parries lock the opponent\u2019s blade for longer if more of the blade overlaps.\r\n</em></em></em></p>\n\n<p><em><em><em><em>\n</em></em></em></em></p>\n<p><em><em><em>Disengage: You can avoid being parried for a short duration by pressing the \u201cW\u201d button.
