The level largely relies on</p>\n<p>the potential of digital games to elicit the player\u2019s emotions (Isbister 2016), by presenting at first a relaxed atmosphere,</p>\n<p>and, towards the end, an unsettling emotional juxtaposition.</p>\n<p>From a narratological viewpoint, Koichi tells the story of someone who has lost their memory and must explore the</p>\n<p>given world to remember. Memories are displayed through drawings placed in different points of the level. The player</p>\n<p>is expected to reach a temple on the opposite side of the game. Entering in the temple will display a narrow tunnel</p>\n<p>filled with red fog, and accompanied by painful audio cues, at the end of which the player will find a sign that advice to</p>\n<p>come back to the surface of memories. That is to say, the player must return to the presented world.</p>\n<p>The game duration is supposed to go from 10 to 25 minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T11:36:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/5723bdd1e557dfea3f0cc62f5ae5d61f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ODI"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
