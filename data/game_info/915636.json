It is a remake of the popular game among us in scratch. Hand drawn and everything.\r\nWill there be a DLC?\r\nIndeed. There will be DLC's for this game. As of now, Im planning of making a deluxe edition of the game. It will cost $6 Because it will be made in unity. The deluxe edition may get a free beta but that will be built off scratch.\r\nAny updates for the game?\r\nYes. I will announce that the game will stop getting updates threw a devlog for the game.\r\nIs there multiplayer?\u00a0\r\nNo. But in the deluxe edition there will indeed be multiplayer. I just need time to make it and to get multiplayer running.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T10:25:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fec/fec2227398a3295bf136e389c2d14194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Minecraft Catcherz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
