A woman goes searching through the forest for her girlfriend. She must avoid/fight off skeleton zombies.<br/></p>\n<p>It's my first full game so I'm proud of 'completing' it. The game is very short and there are a lot of gaming conventions and rules that I should have followed. The graphics are also last minute and the 'gameplay' may be hard to follow. Ultimately I just wanted to see what I could do.</p>\n<p>(I have not tested the windows release but the macosx should be working)<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to check it out if you like and leave comments.</p>\n<p>Update: It takes A WHILE for the game to load up in the browser for some reason (like 20 seconds). You also have to click the downloading data button<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/86648dc3b9eb16cb585272a8549b59eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["tadpolili"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
