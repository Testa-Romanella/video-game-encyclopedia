So I decided to make them as homebrew creatures in D&amp;D! Currently, I have only made the Glyphids in 3.5 edition, as it is my home edition. 5e will come out soon, maybe within a month or so, or maybe some other people will adapt the stats I have out for 5e. Either way, enjoy.</p>\n<p>Note: For player enjoyment purposes, I have removed the Glyphid Menace, as playing it would be more annoying and less fun, as well as the Glyphid Detonator, as it would be very messy to make it with only explosive attacks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T05:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a50/a50bccf9a4b5207445f6d2a79ed3d88d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ricky Maasz"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
