The game takes the Downwell core and introduces twin stick action for unique combat encounters, gliding mechanics for a pinch of precision and strategy, and some good ol' fashioned bullet hell boss encounters. All the while, the focus is slick, fast paced action and chaining those combos for big rewards!<br/><br/><strong>Rogue-lite</strong><br/>Like any in the genre the game is tough but each run gives you the chance to unlock new toys to inch further into the fray. Shop gadgets and upgradable weapons on each run allow you to adapt to the dungeons whim.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Multiple biomes<br/></li><li>End of area bosses<br/></li><li>Challenge rooms<br/></li><li>Combo based loot system<br/></li><li>Unlockable weapons and mechanics<br/></li><li>Soft weapon augments and upgrades</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-10T02:25:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40a/40aec9c4685c466283c06ebfe613837f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1984pxls"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["1984pxls"], "esrb_rating": null}
