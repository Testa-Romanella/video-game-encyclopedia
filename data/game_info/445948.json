At the time, I wasn't in a position to develop the game further to the production level I wanted, so it was shelved.\u00a05 years on and 6 commercial releases later,I was making mockups for Playdate and\u00a0managed to bake the visual style down of MORSE down\u00a0to monochrome. Since then, I've remastered the original game with new graphics, overhauled a lot of the old systems and\u00a0built a short demo of the game in Stencyl for Windows, Mac and iOS.\u00a0<br/><br/>This was then pitched to the UKGF, the trailer was refined, a team was assembled\u00a0and thankfully we were\u00a0in pitching the game! We now have the summer months to produce a remastered\u00a0vertical slice in Unity, expand the narrative elements of the project and finish the arcade cabinet to host the game\u00a0(Currently on hold due to the workshop we use being closed to COVID!)</p>\n<p>If you want more information on the project itself, check out the dev log on TIGSource!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Narrative Design:Danni White</p>\n<p>Illustration/Installation Design: Katy Marshall</p>\n<p>Music Production/Audio Design: Luke Smith</p>\n<p>Design/Programming:\u00a0Alex Johansson</p>\n<p>Special thanks also to Will Bedford, who kindly let me use the audio we produced together back in 2015 for the original prototype!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T04:22:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/677a22638eadf59f6865b4439d8863ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["presskit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
