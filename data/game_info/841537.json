It is a boot-sector game.\u00a0The computer can directly boot the game with no OS at all! \u00a0There are plenty of ways you can run the game:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>DOSBox:</strong>\u00a0\"BOOT blockchain.bin\".\u00a0From the command-line:\u00a0dosbox -c 'boot blockchain.bin'\r\n</li><li><strong>QEMU:</strong>\u00a0From the command-line:\u00a0qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=blockchain.bin</li><li><strong>86Box:</strong>\u00a0Attach the \"blockchain.img\" file that has been padded to the length of a full 160K floppy disk.\u00a0Configure a machine with 8088 or better; I found good results using\u00a0the original IBM PC\u00a0with video over an [ISA] CGA adaptor.</li><li>If you're feeling particularly brave, it is possible to flash a bootable USB and try on a real PC.\u00a0It works on my laptop, but I cannot guarantee safety or\u00a0compatibility with your system.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>However you go about loading the game, you are presented with a grid of card suits.\u00a0You want to match five or more of the same symbol in a single horizontal line.\u00a0This clears them out, gives you points, and lets new pieces fall from above. Move with WASD, or rotate the 3x3 cell surrounding your cursor with Q (left) or E (right). Be careful!\u00a0You only get five rotations before you lose. These are refreshed each time you clear some pieces.\u00a0When you have zero available rotations, this is the end of the game.\u00a0Go for a high score! Press a rotate button to reset.</p>\n<p>The code portion is only 440 bytes, leaving room for a partition table \u2014 you can still put files on a drive that boots this game!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T11:00:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d5/6d5650ad2f5f2bfb93f9e31ee1b6f623.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pineberry Fox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
