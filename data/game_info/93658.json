It's a whole lot like the first game, procedural levels, wacky vehicle AI and a loose understanding of how physics works. </p><p>Its better than the first game, though, because it wasn't made in two days... Which means it runs pretty good on most machines, and has a bunch of features that weren't in the first game.</p><p>New features that already exist are:</p><ul><li>Local Hop-In Hop-Out Multiplayer</li><li>Multiple levels</li><li>Wacky Items</li><li>Suburbs</li><li>A Hub World</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Soul Collecting</li><li>Weebul</li></ul><p>And Soon to come:</p><ul><li>More Areas!</li><li>Secret Areas!</li><li>Bosses!</li><li>An End Game!</li><li>Eternal Death!</li><li>Magic!</li><li>Critters!</li><li>And many more things not grounded in reality...</li></ul><p>We are releasing the game early access for folks who want to play, but to keep it sane we are selling it in limited quantities for now.</p><p>\r\n\tNOTE: This game is under heavy development, and we push new builds very often.
