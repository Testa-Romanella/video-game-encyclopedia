A single surviving ship is enough to progress to the next level.<br/><br/>Touch and drag comets that have touched your ships out of the path of your ships.  Comets with flashing colors  indicate they can be dragged, other (non-touched) comets can not be moved. Use the flashing comets to destroy enemy ships, a fast swipe may destroy more than one enemy or use the comets to shield your ships. The more comets and enemies you destroy the higher your score.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a7/9a7aa67a45c6727d75b7d6613a9e4a40.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/cosmic_drop", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Oliver Kelly"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Oliver Kelly"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
