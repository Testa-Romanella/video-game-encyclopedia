Instead, your short career ended with your death. Your achievements and past were buried under the wreckage, somewhere on a plot of barren land called the Crossroads. Death, however, wasn\u2019t your end. It\u2019s only the beginning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, stifled under the thumb of Mastravisch Azvael Ories - the supreme ruler of the Overshadow realm, where ghosts and demons run rampant - you are bound by a life contract - that for an undead means eternal servitude.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Just when you begin to settle into your new life, building some semblance of normalcy, you are betrayed, left to perish. Though weakened, but with a body that finally belongs to you alone, you vow to get revenge on both your almost-destroyer and the damned tyrant that once held your leash. \r\n</p>\n\n<p>- a tale of love, trust, betrayal, and revenge,\u00a0</p>\n<p>- dark fantasy, romance,\u00a0</p>\n<p>- customizable protagonist (name, appearance, family relations, pronouns, background),\u00a0</p>\n<p>- five (5) gender-chooseable love interests,\u00a0</p>\n<p>- 5* different endings\u00a0</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Rating: 17+</p>\n<p><strong>- the first 2 chapters (the demo), around 50k words, are free.
