Written by S\u00f8ren Gr\u00f8nbech, it was inspired by the Defender arcade game and the Defender-like Dropzone for the Commodore 64. The gameplay deviates from Defender in that the task on each level is to carry the 8 pods through a portal, with points upon completing a level for each one saved. The points increase for each level: on levels 5, 9, 13 and so on, the player gets a new set of eight and the scoring resets.</p>\n<p>The number of sprites moving smoothly around the screen is noteworthy. Some, including the Datastorm itself, cover almost the entire length of the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cf/7cfedc08d70abf0b49d5a3a3482f8ab4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Visionary Design Technologies"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Visionary Design Technologies"], "esrb_rating": null}
