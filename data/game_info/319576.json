The color of the ball has to match the color of the cell to be destroyed and getting points for it. After all color cells are destroyed the next level is unlocked. The highscore for each level is saved.</p>\n<p>The game only has 23 levels for now. It might receive updates in the future, like more levels and a level editor but it is unlikely. For me, the purpose of this project was to get used to the Godot engine and not to make a complete game :) I released it anyway and hope it is fun to play :D</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse to control the paddle</li><li>LMB / Space to shoot the ball</li><li>MMB / 1 - 4 change color of the ball</li><li>RMB to activate random velocity (can be used in various situations)</li><li>ESC / P to pause the game</li><li>\u00a0ALT to change mouse confinement</li><li>U unlock all levels (if you want to try all levels from the start)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>OPTIONS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sound</li><li>Music</li><li>Fullscreen</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afeac3c11a8022db8460617ab788b6e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solo Byte Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
