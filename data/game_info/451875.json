This is a solo project made by myself, and it took nearly 4 months to practice drawing sprites and learn how to script and write.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm very passionate about writing stories, and I hope I can make the same Impact to everyone\u00a0as the stories that I've read have made me.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Extra Notes (supporting me etc...?)</strong></p>\n<p>To be honest, I'm not even sure if this game passes the standards. But I'll think about making a\u00a0<strong>Patreon</strong>\u00a0page with perks\u00a0and whatnot\u00a0<strong>IF</strong>\u00a0I think the responses for the game are enough for me to continue the story hereon out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Those funds will be used to commission cg artists, music composers, bg artists, and a writing editor to further improve the game.</p>\n<p>After all,\u00a0It's a lot of work drawing, writing and coding solo and I still need my time.(I'm still below 20 lol)</p>\n<p>But then again, it still will all depend on the views about the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: \"Will I pay for the full game once it's finished?\"</strong></p>\n<p>I want the game to be free for everyone, and I'd like to keep it that way. But like I said, It will still depend.
