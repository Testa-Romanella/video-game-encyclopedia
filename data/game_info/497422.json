And you have infinite potentialities to explore.\"</p>\n<p>This is not just a game about exploring; this is also a story that's told by you. Your actions and choices will determine how far you go on your quest. Every choice makes a difference, some decisions might be life or death depending on what happens next.</p>\n<p>The world itself is alive and interactive, so even if it seems like nothing more than text on a flat screen, don't forget to look around.</p>\n\r\n\"It is a text-based Holodeck, it is super-powered interactive fiction. You're interacting with everything in minute detail, from the environment, characters, objects to\u00a0abstract concepts of what it means to interact with things.\u00a0You're inhabiting a virtual reality simulation with fractal levels of infinite detail.
