The human body is an elegant interplay of so many complex and interrelated systems. Imagine being able to explore them at your leisure and even play a few games to help memorize all of the parts and their functions? Explore the systems of the human body as you travel beneath the surface to learn more about our constituent parts, how they fit together, and how these systems interact to give function to form to human anatomical structures. Don't look now, but there's a skeleton inside of you! Feeling brave? Come see if you can put a human skeleton back together!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>WebGL:</strong></em>\u00a0Click the Play button above and use the\u00a0 Arrow keys to navigate Left and Right through the scene to view the 3D\u00a0environments that can be explored presently in VR.\u00a0The WebGL build has very limited interactability, but it does provide some insight into the project's development and introduces the user to elements of the VR experience that can be immersively explored with the aid of\u00a0VR hardware (such as the Quest 2 build, which is available for download on this page below).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Desktop:</em>\u00a0</strong>Use the\u00a0 Arrow keys to navigate Forward, Backward, Left, and Right through the scene to view the 3D\u00a0models that can be explored presently in VR.\u00a0The PC desktop build\u00a0has limited interactability, but it does provide some insight into the project's development and introduces the user to elements of the VR experience that can be immersively explored with the aid of\u00a0VR hardware (such as the Quest 2 build, which is available for download on this page below).\u00a0<br/>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Quest 2:</strong></em>\u00a0Use the Quest 2's Lefthand and Rightand\u00a0Thumbsticks to move around the scene.

In another\u00a0scene the user selects to\u00a0spawn\u00a0 skeletons with different levels of detail: the human\u00a0skull, a complete spinal column, and a full human skeleton. The skeleton\u00a0spawns, then\u00a0collapses to the floor at which point the\u00a0user can pick up the bones\u00a0and put them back in place to rebuild the skeleton. Another scene allows users\u00a0to gaze inside the body through a scoped portal while moving around the 3D figure\u00a0to learn more about how these systems\u00a0are interconnected.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T11:53:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59e736d8b790df41738b4bd7cf181be3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AlterLearning"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
