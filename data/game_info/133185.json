Currently there are 4 levels though this game can be a bit of a challenge. </p><p>Use z, spaceBar, or mouse click to jump and use the mouse to navigate the UI.</p><p>I've been able to get the game to run on two different Macs, one running El Capitan the other Sierra, as well as a few different Windows machines. I don't have a linux distro to test on so I'm not sure it actually works though it most likely will since the game runs on Java.</p><p>The game is also available on the play store as an open beta. There are ads in the first level only. Once you beat it they will go away.</p><p>As the game is still in development there is no sound... yet.</p><p><strong>ANDROID BETA LINK</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d452b600a706e35f1207b4aa1611e290.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ndnninja"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
