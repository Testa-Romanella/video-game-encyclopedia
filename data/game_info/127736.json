{"id": 127736, "slug": "j-weatherman-jr", "name": "J. Weatherman Jr.", "name_original": "J. Weatherman Jr.", "description": "<p>J. Weatherman Jr. is a 3D weather simulator in which players forecast the weather by reading, interpreting, and synthesizing data from prediction instruments, both real and fictitious. Many of the inner workings of these enigmatic instruments are intentionally shrouded to the player to encourage player progression along with the evolution of the in-game avatar, who is himself an apprentice weatherman. It was created during the 2017 Global Game Jam at the site hosted by myself through the Student Game Developers at UVA. <br/></p><p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p><p>Zach Danz - Director/Lead Programmer/Lead Designer</p><p>Jack Herd - Programmer<br/>Sanjana Mendu - Programmer<br/>Hasan Khan - Programmer<br/>Nathaniel Saxe - Programmer</p><p>Annie Vu - Artist<br/>Susannah Jones - Artist</p><p>Brian Burke - Audio</p><p>Wyatt Joyner - Designer<br/>Simon Whittle<br/>Wesley Daugherty - Designer<br/>William Wong - Designer<br/>Minsoo Choi - Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65e/65efa74e571f9dc41568f2bf96f3788c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Zachary Danz"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
