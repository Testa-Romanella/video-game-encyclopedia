{"id": 625411, "slug": "wee-beasties-prototype", "name": "Wee Beasties (prototype)", "name_original": "Wee Beasties (prototype)", "description": "<p><strong>Note: Works best with controller!</strong>\n</p>\r\nOverview\r\n<p>Wee Beasties (prototype)\u00a0is a 2d platformer of sorts in which you play as a mythical\u00a0Scottish beast looking for its children (the wee beasties). You fly around the level, overground and underground, bouncing off walls, trying to avoid and hit enemy obstacles and finding each wee beastie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wee Beasties was started and finished between 1st - 18th\u00a0June 2021, approx. a week's work in total.</p>\n<p><em>If the prototype was ever made into a larger game it would still be hand drawn but clearly more polished, with a much larger and varied world inspired by Scottish geography, history and mythology. The flying mechanic featured here would just be one of various mechanics, similar to gaining a cape that allows you to fly in an otherwise grounded platform game.</em></p>\r\nGame per month 2\r\n<p>After releasing my last game QuestBall on mobile in Summer 2020 I found working on the next project a challenge. Part creative block, part COVID-era issues, the next big idea just never progressed. So I\u2019ve opted to make a series of games, each of them started and completed in a month. That\u2019s a month of spare time, evenings and the occasional working day (approx. one week's actual work\u00a0per month). I see each of them like a game jam, an experiment, a chance to try out a genre, style or technique. Its inspired by\u00a0Sokpop Collective\u00a0and Rami Ismail's\u00a0Game a Week\u00a0post.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Everything is by me,\u00a0Stuart Wallace.\u00a0I'm a Scottish 40-something dad and app creator living near Brighton in the UK. I\u00a0dabble in game-making in my spare time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wee Beasties art was all hand-drawn on paper, with photos taken of the drawings and then cleaned up in Sketch. \u00a0The music is a\u00a0manipulated midi file of a traditional Scottish country dancing tune.\u00a0The game was otherwise made in Unity.</p>\r\nDonations\r\n<p>This game is 100% free and you're welcome to download as such.
