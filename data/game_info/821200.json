Lock it!<br/>Found an enemy you find easy to beat?\u00a0Lock it!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reflection on the jam<br/></em></strong>The jam was alot of fun (it was my first)! At the start of the jam I thought my scope would be too small, but as everyone always says, I was dead wrong haha. The mechanical scope was fine, but I would have liked to add more weapons, enemies and upgrades. The upgrades in the game right now are pretty generic stat upgrades, but initially I wanted to make ridiculous upgrades like projectiles splitting, random explosions etc.<br/></p>\n<p>Another big thing was playtesting. Before sunday (the last day of the jam) I didn't have anyone playtest. There were 'problems' in the game I knew about, but having someone else play gave me a very good insight as to what the 'real' problems were and how I could fix them while keeping it fun for the player.</p>\n<p>Overall it was an amazing experience and it thought me a lot about just building systems and gameplay and letting someone test them, instead of staying in the technical concept area forever that we developers know and love :)</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy the game as much as I did making it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T06:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a6/9a667e3c43e7ba7bc5e52aa0236cea61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wafelzx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
