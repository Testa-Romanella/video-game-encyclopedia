This project features 2-dimensional levels, as well as inventory, dialogue, economic, narrative, fast travel, and combat systems. The game itself places the player in the shoes of a traveler, stuck in a science-fiction world, trying to get-rich-quick. After his plans and schemes fail, he sets out to find the gold mines. Along the way, he runs into an old man who has some ideas of his own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T10:51:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d1ac397ae5c910d42cad0e2c3c1e617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Project Titan Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
