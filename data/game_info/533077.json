The players must rebuild the city from the gray stone metropolis they are met with to the colourful, lively and energetic city it once was. Fedora is a circular city, divided into six districts, encircling a central building, the museum. This level is the area called Shiraz where the canals have all dried up. The player will walk around the city collecting resources in order to get the water from the river to flow back through the canals revitalizing the city and restoring it back to its former beauty, the true Shiraz.</p>\n<p>Shayla Reyes\u00a0DATT3300 Lab 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T06:19:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbc/cbc1aefded8875c4bd647fc63fc6b5d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sgr91"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
