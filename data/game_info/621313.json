If jim and jimbo get to far apart, the rope breaks and you have to restart the level. There are 8 levels in total. I'm sorry it's a .py file and not a executable but I've spent a long time trying to convert it and can't. If someone finds out how, please tell me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/071/0712fd3cd456d4c8b72d1eb7c7bcb764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HOCKEYsLIT"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
