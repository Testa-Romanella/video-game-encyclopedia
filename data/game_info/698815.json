{"id": 698815, "slug": "vettscape", "name": "Vettscape", "name_original": "Vettscape", "description": "<p>The world is seen through the eyes of a misunderstood vette that has to escape from the evil humans that hunt and kill vettes. The humans have placed all sorts of traps to capture vettes that wander around in the woods. The vette has managed to escape captivity from a human camp, and must now try to get home. They can only see with the help of a small torch, and therefore needs to listen for sound cues to evade projectiles and guards. If the vette succedes, they will return safely to their family at the other side of the woods. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Created by Benedicte H.
