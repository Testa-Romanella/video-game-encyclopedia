Judgeball: Lethal Arena is a fast-paced competitive 3V3 handbrawl game. Choose between multiple Scavengers with their unique set of skills and use them to seize the victory. Get ready for 5 brutal minutes of skirmish, in Judgeball you gain points by scoring goals or by killing your opponents!<br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Choose your Scavenger wisely.</h3></strong><br/>Judgeball features 3 races: angels, cyborgs and demons. Each race counters another and gets countered by the third, like a game of rock-paper-scissor. Those races have their own racial ability: demons can become invisible, angels are able to fly and cyborgs can fire a shockwave. Each Scavenger also belongs to a weight class. Light characters run fast but will lose the ball more easily when struck by an opponent. Heavy characters run slowly but won't let the ball go easily. Medium characters fall in-between those two. Choose the playstyle that suits you best!<br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Gear up for the fight!</h3></strong><br/>Judgeball's tactical system goes way deeper with equipments! Those perks will impact your gameplay. For example, a heavy armor will let you endure more hits before losing the ball, a jet-pack will give you the ability of doing double jumps! Your playstyle can be entirely tweaked up with the proper build. There's a limit though. Each piece of equipment has its value, there's a cap that you can't go past.<br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Select your role in the arena.</h3></strong><br/>Will you be a fierce striker? A goalkeeper who's a literal wall? Or maybe a midfielder that will make the decisive call? Choose your role in the arena, but don't get married to it! In Judgeball the only way to recover health is to go heal in the goal zone of your team, this will allow for some rotation with your allies. And remember that if you die... you'll give a point to your opponents!<br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Dominate on the field.</h3></strong><br/>Each character has its personal ultimate ability. Use it wisely to take the upper hand. If you want to score some legendary goals, you will have to master the Magnus Shot which will allow you to create some sick angles for scoring. Maybe this sounds too much of a hustle and you just want to punch out the goalkeeper to win, well... that's actually an option.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T10:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff16e5508312105e9ba9c306cf47ef60.jpg", "website": "https://www.wildbishop.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 524, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wild Bishop"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wild Bishop"], "esrb_rating": null}
