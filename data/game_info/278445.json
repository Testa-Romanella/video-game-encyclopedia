I mean what are you supposed to do with all this free time.\r\nRead books? No\u2026 and the interior as well. It\u2018s so lame. Could do with some color and nice new furniture. \r\nTo be honest I\u2018d rather be in a mansion right now.\r\nCollecting keys, opening doors\u00a0 and\u00a0 stepping on that mysterious light spot might help with that. \r\nOh, and don\u2019t get caught by the cop!\r\n\r\nConfusing Prison Mansion is a challenging puzzle adventure created by three tired Students. For the first ever game we created, we had the challenge of using a random game title. We generated our game title with The Video Game Name Generator. \r\n\r\n\u00a0Hope you enjoy our game.\r\n\u00a0Much love to you &lt;3", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/9794081099c9b7b926909cc02b5ac5f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ledicdra"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
