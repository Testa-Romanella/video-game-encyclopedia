{"id": 432409, "slug": "labyrinth-of-wild-abyss", "name": "Labyrinth of Wild Abyss", "name_original": "Labyrinth of Wild Abyss", "description": "<p>This is not a horror game about things that jump out and scare you. This is a horror game about feeling lost and being worried about dying instantly to what's around the next corner.</p>\n<p>This game does not care about what came before or what comes after. There is only the labyrinth.<br/></p>\n<p>This game has enemies that you cannot beat, only outrun. They are slow, they aren't smart, but they are patient, they are many, and they are powerful. Some will be very obvious with their presence, and some will blend in almost perfectly with their surroundings. Make sure to save when you have breathing room.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0There is an ongoing bounty where the first person to have video evidence that they've beaten this game will get every public project I have made and will make for free. I must emphasize that you should not feel bad for trying and failing, as this game (and most of my other games) is meant to be a test against the hubris of humanity.</p><br/>\n<p>[Side note: this game engine (Smile Game Builder) is not very flexible so just ignore most of the menu (assessed through the Esc key) and use it only to save your progress. Also, during my first test my antivirus forced it closed to scan it, so if it does that just the once for you please don't send bug reports about that; it's pretty out of my hands. Also, there is no soundtrack; I was listening to this playlist during most of development and I recommend it.]<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T13:08:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bb/3bb99037f94774e739a3bd8f2b824ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CannibalInteractive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
