{"id": 700898, "slug": "super-block-world-demo", "name": "Super Block World Demo", "name_original": "Super Block World Demo", "description": "<p>Super Block World is a puzzle-platformer in the style of the classic ZX81.</p>\n<p>This is a demo version created in seventy-two hours for the Lost Cartridge Game Jam of 2021.</p>\n<p>There are currently six levels.</p>\n<p>Solo developer and no third-party assets used.</p>\n<p>All graphics were created using the limited 128 character set for the ZX81 as the ZX81 was not capable of graphics beyond this (with the exception of hi-res mode). There is no sound or music due to the ZX81 not having a sound chip or speaker. This was also created in the native screen resolution of 256x192 (resized to fill the screen).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Goal:</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the key to the locked door to progress to the next level. When you grab the key, you have a limited amount of time before it disappears and respawns where it started. The key will start flashing when it is about to respawn.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Move: Arrow Keys (L-Stick or D-Pad for Xbox controller)</p>\n<p>- Jump/Double Jump: Space (A Button for Xbox controller)</p>\n<p>- Pick-Up-Key: Down Arrow (Down on L-Stick or D-Pad for Xbox controller)</p>\n<p>- Throw Key: Control (X Button for Xbox controller)</p>\n<p>- Depending on what direction you are pressing, determines how you throw the key.</p>\n<p>I do hope you all enjoy this as much as I enjoyed making it. After the game jam has concluded, I will start work on completing this game. I have lots planned for it, and this demo is just a tiny taste of what I have in store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:25:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/565/565677ac3d6e8409431b7ab7adc274a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr. Hobbyist Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
