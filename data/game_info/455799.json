The theme was \"Roll\" and I decided to make a simple platformer game. Tha player can control the rotation of\u00a0some environment elements to explore the level.</p>\n<p>How to start the game:\u00a0Extract the game files and execute \"Craby, the Roller\" executable.</p>\n<p>If you get stuck, die or cannot jump, press R to respawn, collision is still a little buggy. To close the game, press Alt+F4.</p><p>If you want a full game like this, make sure to donate any ammount! Thanks for playing :D</p>\r\nSpecial thanks:\r\n<ul><li>B\u00e1rbara Penha for her support!</li><li>Daniel Ferezin for the music!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T03:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea7/ea711a69e6caa4b4a4b7ea6ba0829490.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pixel Labs"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
