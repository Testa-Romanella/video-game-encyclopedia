All downloadables with \"_tic80\" are built from this version. They are provided free of charge and the code is under MIT license (you can access it in edit mode in tic80).</p>\n<p>The game was also ported to Love2d. Downloadables with \"_love2d\" are built from this version. A small donation is required to download this version. Currently the Love2d version is nearly a direct copy of the original tic80 version, but some extra goods are offered:</p>\n<ul><li>A title page with a small piece of music, and a mystery to discover</li><li>New updates in the future (I will no longer work on the tic80 version)</li><li>A sincere thanks from the author for your support</li></ul>\n<p>Special notes:</p>\n<p>The *.tic file requires TIC80 to load and run. The *.love file requires love2d to load and run. Just download these loaders for your OS to run the game.</p><p><strong>ATTRIBUTES<br/></strong></p><p>The opening music of the Love2d version is clipped from a song by \u0130lker Yal\u00e7\u0131ner (ilkeryalciner.com) at https://opengameart.org/content/wake-up.
