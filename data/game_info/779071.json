The button that you use in this game is the spacebar. To get through the title and instructions, all you need to do is hold down the button for a short period of time.\u00a0In this game the crane moves by itself, and your only interaction is to lower the crane. Holding down the spacebar will lower the crane and releasing it will allow the crane to retract.\u00a0 This game was very fun to make, and I am proud of how it came out. I even added an endless mode to make the game feel more like a finished product. The art used in the game\u00a0was made by me with the use of Piskle. When I was designing the toys in Piskle, I just let my cursor go where I felt like. I didn't really have a plan for the toy designs, but I really like how they turned out.</p>\r\nHere are pictures of the toys that I used in the game:\r\n\n<p>These Alien toys.</p>\n\n<p>I don't even know what to call this.</p>\n\n<p>And this bug thing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T10:49:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d67e0e7dfba9f28ee0f6c7f3cf019fd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Kiran M."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
