When Vogar was invaded by its neighbor, the empire of Limor, the resulting war brought famine and devastation that surpassed everyone\u2019s worst nightmares.<br />\nHowever, for people of Vogar not all hope is lost yet. There are rumors that descendants of the royal family might still be alive...<br />\nAscan and Glen are facing a nearly impossible task. To reclaim their homeland, they need to form an army of bold souls willing to join them, all while evading Alastar\u2019s attention. On their journey, they will meet familiar faces from the days of their childhood as well as new allies tired of the Limorian oppression.<br />\nHowever, they know that they won\u2019t prevail against the magician\u2019s wrath even if they could field the largest army Vogar had ever seen. Their hope rests on recent magical outbursts Ascan has experienced \u2013 and the persistent legends of the most powerful magic known to the realm, a force called \u201cAscension\u201d. With it, they could shift the tide in their favour. But they are not the only ones on the hunt for this power\u2026<br />\nThe three main playable characters are Ascan, a magically gifted descendant of the royal family, his brother Glen, an impulsive adventurer with his own sense of humor and Jane, a kind-hearted healer who is looking for an excuse to escape her home town, as she would love nothing more than to explore the world.<br />\nOpposing them is the ruler of the empire of Limor, the sinister magician Alastar. No one had ever heard of him until about a year before the war, when the tension between the two countries was starting to rise, and so the wizard emerged from the shadows to conquer the throne. His motives and ambitions are unknown, but horrifying tales of his boundless fury are being told even in faraway lands.<br />\nA unique, story-driven adventure with an emphasis on the characters\u2019 personal journey<br />\nTurn based battle system focusing on strategic decisions<br />\nBreathtaking custom soundtracks<br />\nAtmospheric game design with immersive soundeffects<br />\nMinigames that will challenge a variety of your skills\u200b<br />\nThe best from the old days without its flaws (quest journal to guide you, NO grinding)<br />\nBase building, where your base changes based on allies you have recruited<br />\nYour choices matter - the ending changes based on how you ulitize your recruited allies<br />\nTotal playtime: 8-10 hoursMessage from the developerHi there,<br />\nmy name is Torsten, I am 34 years old and you have no idea how proud I am that you have landed here!!!<br />\nNot is this game just my personal little gem but it was, at many points throughout the last years, also kind of an enemy to me. The love I have for it led to a development time of over 15 years - rewriting the story, reinventing characters and updating graphics over and over. That being said - I hope you enjoy the game as much as many others already did (big shout-out to all beta testers! :-) )<br />\nWhen you decide to buy the game and enjoy it - make sure to leave a comment. In case you don&#39;t like it, feel free to recommend it to your worst enemies and family members.<br />\nCheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-28T16:19:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82b/82ba7d5b5d68331437b1a921af3241ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 454, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Torsten Scholze"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Torsten Scholze"], "esrb_rating": null}
