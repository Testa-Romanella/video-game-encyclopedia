The first has two main objectives:</p>\n<ol><li>Contextualize the game world, in order to increase user's identification in the pseudo-narrative context.</li><li>Explain the application\u00a0mechanics, showing which elements can be interacted with (the elements that can subsequently generate distractions) and some\u00a0possible actions.<br/>Here are some examples of distractions:<br/>- coffee / drink spilling<br/>- phone notifications\u00a0/ calls<br/>- radio buttons interactions<br/>- car elements interactions (directional lights, dashboard, lights, wipers...)<br/>and more..</li></ol>\n<p>During the second phase, the user is asked to independently manage distractions while driving the vehicle.</p>\n<p>During this phase, external dangers are minimized in order to let the user focus on managing distractions.</p>\n<p>After a certain period of time (enough to make the user fully understand\u00a0\u00a0the game mechanics),\u00a0very dangerous and difficult to avoid events are generated which will produce an unexpected accident that will end the experience with an emotional message.</p>\n\n<p>Mouse and keyboard are required.</p><p>Assets from\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:43:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/101/101faaf176f8044f647f45f8bcee93a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Safe_Driver"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
