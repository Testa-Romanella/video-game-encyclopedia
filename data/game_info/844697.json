Choose one of three playable classes, and up to two pairs of\u00a0moves called 'Invocations' and strategise your way into defeating these cosmic horrors and taking their Invocations for your own.</p>\n<p>As it turns out\u00a0<em>as above, so below</em>, - you can't choose the outcome of your dice rolls, but you can certainly still choose which moves to allocate them to and take control of your own destiny.<br/><br/><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>The character may navigate through the world by looking with the mouse, and by using the W, S,\u00a0A, and D keys to move. Using the left mouse allows the player to interact with elements in the game world, and the mouse is also used during combat; drag dice into the receptacles of your choosing and hit the 'Use' button to trigger the Invocation. When you have no more moves or dice remaining, end your turn and the opponent will make their moves.<br/></p>\n<p>There are a total of seven Principles to defeat, with varying difficulties and each with a unique move set and AI. You may challenge them in any order of your choosing, though you may inevitably find some a lot easier to defeat than others, and that you may not initially have the moves you require to counter theirs.</p>\n<p>The game does not automatically end when all seven Principles have been defeated; you are free to continue as you please and repeat challenges and\u00a0try new builds. Press the Escape key at any time to immediately exit the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Hardware Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>This game was built as a showcase for advanced raytracing features in Unreal Engine 4 and as such has an absolute minimum GPU requirement of an RTX2070, though an RTX3060 or better is recommended for best results.</p>\n<p><strong>Designer's Notes:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>This game is loosely themed around the seven Hermetic principles in the New Age text\u00a0<em>The Kybalion</em>: a Study of the Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece</em><em>, </em>in which the titular game jam theme 'as above, so below' appears -\u00a0but the game mechanics themselves are more concerned with the literal interpretation of 'above and below', as well as the idea of being able to control one's own destiny regardless of the hand that fate deals you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T08:11:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b68/b68c59135ba6b7ae63e18dbbe09a308c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ambershee"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
