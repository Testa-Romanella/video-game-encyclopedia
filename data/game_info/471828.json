Gaining more controls opens up the world all metroidvania-like. Or so we planned. (shrug)<br/></p>\n<p>We overscoped and didn't have enough time to finish the level design as fully as we wanted to, so there are a number of finished mechanics we were unable to put into the final build's levels, but it is playable. Have fun :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T05:13:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b19/b19925c9ded02df5f241b9a83fe33114.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex", "s9menine"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
