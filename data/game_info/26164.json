They absorb \n      sound waves transmitted through water and use them as a form of \n      nutrition. The sound waves that the Rec-Rec eat are then stored inside \n      their bodies until they have been digested. Once the digestion process \n      is complete, they play back the sounds in perfect four-second intervals. \n      While these sounds are playfully emitted, the wave patterns can be \n      observed pulsating on their bodies. Rec-Rec always swim side by side in \n      schools of four. When they swim at different speeds, the frequency with \n      which they emit sounds also changes.\n    </p><p>\n      More Electroplankton Games!\n    </p><ul>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Trapy\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Hanenbow\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Nanocarp\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Beatnes\n      </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d0b76d55e51b72aba903c27d38ea8ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
