Once you start, you won\u2019t want to stop. Try it, and see how high you can score. The goal is to group five or more fruits of the same kind together. Once the fruits are grouped, your score increases, and the grouped fruits disappear to make room for more maneuvers. After each turn, more fruits appear on the board and your task becomes more difficult. The game is over when the board completely fills up.
