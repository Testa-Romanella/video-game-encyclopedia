In this and all other text conversations, press the spacebar to advance the conversation. There should have been an on-screen button for this, but I ran out of time. Bite me.</li><li>You will now have to move everybody's schedule around on the calendar to try and get a day when everyone is free. Player faces that are DARKENED are free that day, player faces in BRIGHT COLOUR have a conflicting responsibility. You have a limited number of MOVES. Removing a player from a day costs a move and adds to that player's METER. Placing a player on a day does not cost a move and removes 1 from that player's meter. Click the circled faces in the bottom right hand corner to select which player you will be removing from the calendar or adding to it.</li><li>You will find that one player is fully booked the entire week. This is where a mission comes in. Click the MISSION button and then a day on the calendar to start a mission. The game will choose randomly from all the players on the day that you clicked who are still not free, so make sure to get your strategising done before starting a mission. Unless the chosen player is you, the GM (which it always will be if your top-left portrait is still lit up on the given day), you will get one of four random missions that involves driving to a number of destinations in your car.</li><li>In the car section, use the UP, LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to drive the car. Try to get to the icon shown at the top of your screen beside \"OBJECTIVE\". If multiple icons are shown, you do not need to visit them in a specific order, and you may not need to visit all of them at all. Once you have visited all the shown icons, you may get a new set of icons or the mission may end.</li><li>Back on the phone and calendar screen, clicking GAME NIGHT and then a calendar day will cause you to attempt to hold game night on that day. The ending you get will depend on how many people can make game night- four is the minimum- and whether you personally could make it as the GM. Once you click \"OKAY\" on the ending screen, the game will exit.</li></ol><p>LIST OF MAJOR BUGS STILL IN THE GAME:</p><ol><li>The fallback map used because I couldn't get procGen working in time is terrible. It's hardly even a map. This isn't really a bug but it's sure as hell going to look like one. Feel free to edit the ones and zeroes in fallback01 to your taste- as long as the whole thing is 50 * 50 it should still work.</li><li>Sometimes, a mission goal will spawn at 0, 0 on the map, fencing it in with buildings and making it impossible to reach. I have no idea why this happens.</li><li>It is not currently possible to clear a day by completing a mission, because the game will crash when you click \"OK\" on the mission ending splash.</li><li>The above doesn't matter for full completion at all, because there is no check in place for whether you reassigned all the schedule blocks you unassigned on the calendar screen like you're supposed to; so to get the best ending, just remove all six players' schedule blocks on a day and name that day as game night.</li><li> The buttons and objects used in calendar mode are still there and responsive to clicking while they are hidden in phone mode. In testing it was possible to crash the game with a series of clicks with this in mind and I believe it still is possible.</li><li>Mission goals have a smaller hitbox than they are supposed to, so they are sometimes difficult to properly collide with to advance objectives.</li><li>A whole load of content I wanted to put in is unimplemented and the game itself doesn't actually tell you how to play it. Please stand by.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T03:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2eb4161c32f2183562e6b34f26c54f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CleverCrumbish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
