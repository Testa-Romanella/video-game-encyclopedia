If a piece would hit another with the same number they combine their values into one.\u00a0 The goal is to reach a piece with the number 2048.</p>\n<p>After you took a move in one direction, a random amount of pieces will spawn on the opposite site. For example after pressing the right arrow key you will find new pieces spawned in at the left most column.</p>\n<p>You lose if no possible action would result in a piece moving, spawning in or result in two pieces combining. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Note that this game does <em>not</em> use the same odds and algorithms to spawn in pieces as the classic 2048 game does.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed, programmed and designed by Sundiray with the help of Texture Assets from the Unity Asset store and taking inspiration from the classic game 2048.</p>\n<p>My intention of this project was to further improve as well as challenge my knowledge of the Unity game engine, my C# capabilities and get in first testing of various self developed tools for the Unity Editor.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T04:20:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2c/c2ce40d2d332cc50614d576d8d3e4180.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sundiray"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
