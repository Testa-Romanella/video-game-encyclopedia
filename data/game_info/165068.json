Anyway, I'm on the last stretch of this story. I've finished the main plot (the top choice for every action) and the interesting mall choice. Hopefully the next update will be sooner. I plan on finishing these stories next:</p><ol><li>Gina</li><li>Pregnant</li><li>Beach</li></ol><p>I actually want to start a new game after this one with the things I've learned. Thank you for being patient with me and for those who donated without being prompted.
