You have a trust protector in you golem. However, he relies on the power of the sun to operate.</p><p>The theme of the game jam was based on the following quote:</p><p>\"Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,</p><p>That I shall say good night till it be morrow.\"</p><p>This is a very unfinished game. Please forgive all the bugs, and the fact that there's really no objective, or ending, to the game.</p><p>Made by Kevin Erdmann and Austin Erickson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcb/dcbcb1a6fa1eda582898dfa9d2a849fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["badwolf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
