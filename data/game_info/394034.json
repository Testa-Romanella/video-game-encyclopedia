The game is meant to start off very easy while still introducing you to new mechanics and features.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Basic functions.</li></ul>\n<p>Throughout the game the player collects wishes in order to unlock new levels to play,\u00a0 new each level *\"WILL\"* Introduce something new to the player to keep the game interesting and fun.</p>\n<ul><li>Story?</li></ul>\n<p>There will be a story, but when the player begins the game it will not be hinted at until the completion of Pine Hills (World 1) and will be continued to be explained after every 12 levels. I feel like this is a good idea so it\u00a0doesn't distract too much from the game-play.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Identity</li></ul>\n<p>I want as much as I can create in this game to be as unique as possible. From the levels to the music to the art style and even the story. \u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Feedback</li></ul>\n<p>I humbly beg you to at least give the game a try, Testing all 4 levels within the demo without dying or losing lives in any of them should only take a total of 5 minutes but that's how fast I completed it being the DEV ;P Please let me know what you think either on E<strong>mail </strong>or\u00a0C<strong>omments </strong>below.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and check out the game below</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>~Charziot</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:12:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/76856ed85038f522fb29fae01fec6af9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charziot"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
