(You heard that right - LOW RES BABY!!!) It is part of a 9 chapter (this one has 3 chapters)\u00a0 parody of the Commodore story. Names and facts altered so not to offend or infringe.</p>\n<p>It has over 100 hand drawn rooms and close ups, dozens of animations, samples &amp; mods (some mine, some from the Amos PD Library - authors unknown), puzzles to solve and decisions to make. It should challenge your decision making skills. <br/></p>\n<p>You will not die in the game if you make a wrong decision, you should be able to complete it in a couple of sittings or so.<br/></p>\n<p>The file includes a Game Guide. Please spend a little time to read\u00a0 this before playing for a better playing experience. It provides important information such as how to play the game, and very important memory management information.</p>\n<p>Now off to complete the next 3 chapters of the adventures of George Angus in <br/>Geo's Quest, \"Gateway to Nowhere\". Coming Soon.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing Geo's Quest<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T14:10:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72a/72a35f81f57a2e7845b5a9801163ac77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GWI"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
