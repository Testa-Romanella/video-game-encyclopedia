It basically takes the Stasis Rune mechanic from Zelda BOTW and applies it to an FPS puzzle game. Heavy inspiration was also drawn from portal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's got a lot of bugs and looks kinda dodgy for the most part, but that's why it's still a prototype. It was more just a means to test a game mechanic I suppose.\u00a0I hope to work on this game again in the future when I've improved my skills.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, I also voiced the really crappy tutorial that's present. It's long winded and my accent randomly changes halfway through, but you'll need it to help you with the puzzles.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- E: Pick up boxes</p>\n<p>- Left Mouse: Fire time beam</p>\n<p>- Right Mouse: Fire force beam</p>\n<p>- Movement: WASD/Space</p>\n<p>- Q: Unfreeze all frozen objects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T07:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e01eea840eccb899a3f50c44fa6e16bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheEggmeister"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
