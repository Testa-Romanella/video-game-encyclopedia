I had to cut a few niceties like sound effects, level selection, and a fancier title screen, but it's got graphics, solid\u00a0mechanics, and a full game loop. The scoring system is based on the one in the Game Boy version, but with points only given when lines are cleared, and values divided by 10 to fit in Pico-8's 32,767 maximum. Hope you enjoy playing it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T07:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de7/de714f9aef7bbf6050a0b58156d4f593.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jadelombax"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
