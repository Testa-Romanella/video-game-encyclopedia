First thing I've ever made in Gamemaker too. <br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by my lockdown madness, daytime tv, old Llamasoft games and some gamemaker tutorials/the gm discord. It's just a really basic endless shooter. <br/></p>\n<p>\"Playable\" with Mouse and Keyboard or Xbox/PS4 pads. Joypad controls are kinda scuff so it's best to just endure this game using wsad controls. <br/>***N.B, Apparently the mouse/keyboard controls might be broken, if so use the pad for now, I'll fix asap***<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T06:54:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a44/a44d8bcc7662fc8ca17bc4e901f97c1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZaibGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
