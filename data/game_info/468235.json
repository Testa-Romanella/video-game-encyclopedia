Your goal is to dodge people and play arcade at the same time. All this without seeing people coming while playing on the phone!</p>\n<p>Help Ziggy to win in the arcade while dodging pedestrians on the boardwalk using the D and A on the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Two games in one!\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Ziggy the only thing that matters is to win in the game. Without controlling the movement of your ship, use your mouse to shoot asteroids and monsters, being careful not to get hit. But you must do this without having control of the ship, only the direction of its shot.</p>\n<p>Manage reality and game at the same time. Can you win? Or will your addiction make you lose in the game of life?</p>\n\n<p><strong>GMTK Jam (Out of control Theme):</strong></p>\n<p>Our game is about a boy addicted to playing using his cell phone on the street. When we try to control a video game, but at the same time we have to deal with the world around us, we are left with no control over either. The mechanics reflect this lack of control, giving you a lot to control and, thus, generating a lack of control in the player. The player must control the boy in an infinite runner in first person, dodging pedestrians while playing an arcade of asteroids on the cell phone he carries. In the arcade you don't control where the ship goes, just where it shoots, reinforcing the lack of control.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/><strong>D:</strong> dodge to the right<br/><strong>A:</strong> dodge to the left<br/><strong>S:</strong> Lower cellphone<br/><strong>Mouse:</strong> move the ship's shooting direction<br/><strong>Mouse left buton:</strong> shot</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Pepeco</li><li>Camila Mattos</li><li>Sofia Paiva Pougy</li><li>Maru Serpa</li><li>Cael</li><li>Gaid (Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u00a0Gaidzinski)</li><li>Daniel Carias</li><li>Jo\u00e3o</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:17:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c92/c92ccdace0e2f6a14aa70a387cf8eea9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gaidzinski07", "Camila Mattos", "Pepeco", "ArjunaKrishna", "Sofia Pougy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
