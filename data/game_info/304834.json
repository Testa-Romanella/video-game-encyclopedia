If not you can also play a demo here:\u00a0https://saricden-trijam12.netlify.com</p>\n<p>Game is\u00a0<em>open source</em>, so check out the code here:\u00a0https://github.com/saricden/trijam-12</p>\n<p>It is an auto-runner where you only control the jump. The level is randomly generated every time you restart the game (or when you die, or beat the level). It shows your completion percentage at the top of the game on each level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The longer you run, the faster he goes, and the contrail becomes more opaque (or it's supposed to... I might've messed up my config). This was my representation of the theme <em>black &amp; white</em> which I broke down to think of as meaning\u00a0<em>contrast</em>. The greater your contrast grows to the background, the greater your speed grows.</p><p>Oh also it is compatible with mobile and desktop, so you can play on your phone or computer (note might be more difficult on smaller screens, as you can't see as far ahead... Impromptu hard mode?).</p>\n<p>If I had time I was going to add different gestures for doing some different tricks that would expend your charged up\u00a0<em>contrast energy</em> or whatever (double jump, speed burst, back up and shoot a laser?).</p>\n<p>You can see the Todo lists here:\u00a0https://github.com/saricden/trijam-12/issues/1</p>\n<p>I think that's everything, if you have any questions please comment or do what you're supposed to do on Itch, I'm not sure I'm new here.</p>\n<p>&gt;:D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-29T05:11:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/353fd18a20472813e1c85805df416934.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["saricden"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
