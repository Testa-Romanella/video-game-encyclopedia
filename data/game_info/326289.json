Dodge grenade launching sentries and patrolling probe mines while blasting open doors and disrupting shield generators or force fields. Beware of the wardens though, as each one has it's own special ability hiding in it's circuits - none of which are very forgiving. You'll die a few times, but each time you can upgrade you character to make the next attempt a little easier - and those who stay vigilant may one day escape their robotic captors.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f0/6f0a28718eefc6fc3b3c4ff879553db4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sharksauce"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sharksauce"], "esrb_rating": null}
