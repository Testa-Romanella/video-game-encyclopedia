You can change the controls in the launcher however you will need to understand Unity's input semantics here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e83/e8384841bcac5de0cff8db05d86e2e8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mandlebar"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
