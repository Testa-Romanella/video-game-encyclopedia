{"id": 915243, "slug": "simon-said-stop", "name": "SIMON SAID STOP", "name_original": "SIMON SAID STOP", "description": "<p><strong>SIMON SAID STOP</strong> is in some ways like a game you used to play on the playground, and in other ways like a game from a popular survival drama where almost everyone has to die.</p>\n<p>You and some other characters are initially placed into one end of a room that is roughly the size of a soccer field. There are signs all around the room which give you simple commands. The commands you're given only apply if they are preceded by \"SIMON SAID\". Failure to correctly follow these commands results in elimination by laser cannons. The goal is to reach the other side of the field and eventually be the last person standing. If two or more people make it to the safe zone, you turn around and the game continues.\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay Tips<strong>\n</strong>\n<ul><li>When you are targeted for elimination, try seeking shelter behind another player.\r\n</li><li>After die, you can \"soul jump\" to a nearby player to continue playing.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>The default number of players in the game is 100, but you can adjust this to be anywhere between 2 and 500 depending on what your hardware can handle. A modern laptop with Intel graphics should have no problem handling 500 players on the downloadable versions, but the web-based version is less performant. The laser cannons stop working correctly at less than 20 FPS, so you'll want to be mindful of that on low-end hardware.</p>\r\nSeeking Feedback\r\n<p>This is my first video game ever. It's built with Godot, and the game logic is written completely in Rust using the godot-rust project. I have some ideas for multiplayer, but I just want to put it out there and gather feedback on the core mechanics before deciding next steps.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T07:30:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c6/9c60481e3923a7b08b7d2897e1776830.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["duhdugg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
