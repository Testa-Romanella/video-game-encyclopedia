In the country of Machania, dragons are bred for the exclusive use of the dragoons, or Knights. Dragons with wings are normally executed as they are deemed to be a bad omen by the citizens. In the war with the Empire, Machania has begun to examine the ancient ways rather than to try to fight a futile war using technological advances. The Empire is technologically more advanced. Randy, the hero, and his newfound friend, the dragon he saved, want to turn the tide of battle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-03T21:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/701/7013588f39304152674bda4b8554ddcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn"], "developers": ["Andromeda"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
