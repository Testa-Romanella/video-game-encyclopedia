You play the part of an average person taken out of their \u2018normal\u2019 dull life and dumped into a garish unfamiliar world where things are not as they may first appear.</p>\n<p>The game has a percentage score that is intended to help the player gauge their progress towards the Seven possible endings and finding all the story parts.\u00a0It also keeps a permanent account of the endings achieved over various games you play, and different game paths can lead to different endings becoming available. So regular saving is recommended.</p><p>Can you get 100% score and all 7 endings?</p><br/>\n<p>I wouldn't personally call this a horror game, but others have! Id say it's a Rogue-like as in when you die you die and have to restart or call up a saved game.\u00a0Origonaly made as a test project to try out some things in RPG maker\u00a0this grew into a rather unusual - non RPG'ish - game. This is primarily an 'ideas' peice.</p><p>**The\u00a0game is not encrypted and has the RPGXP Project file included.\u00a0Please feel free to examine and use this code as you wish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:20:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa0784f11c52d3ca7c38f70b8ada446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["garryg"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
