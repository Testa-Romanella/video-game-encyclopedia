{"id": 393837, "slug": "the-nightmare-sequence", "name": "The Nightmare Sequence", "name_original": "The Nightmare Sequence", "description": "<p>*Warning* Dialogue about self-harm is in this story.</p>\n<p>This interactive fiction narrative is about a young girl who is experiencing a sequence of nightmares in one single night, resulting from past fears and traumas that she has experienced. There are three different nightmare outcomes that happen before the final one, which leads to the protagonist waking up finally at peace. Each of the nightmares focus on her fears regarding death, abandonment, pressure and inability to control emotions. There is a moment in the story that does involve potential self-harm, and I do understand that that can be a sensitive topic for many, but I chose to include it in the story to show the severity of the somber events happening throughout the story. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T03:25:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/037/037f5173465a3169fa1d319b3dbf504e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["monizalannah26"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
