Pilot a flying saucer\u00a0around the town, abduct the residents and scan them to reveal items. Use these items to repair the damaged Mothership. Avoid detection as much as possible or the local police will start to investigate, and the MIB will arrive.<br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0plan to keep working on the game, and hopefully upload a deluxe version with a way bigger map, and more features. I wanted to put something out there for people to play so hopefully I can get some feedback that will help me decide what I want to do with the game.</p>\n<p>jhyde927@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0@J_Hyde_</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvcvwfl2PKN7VtTer5lKyOg</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/jhyde-150964969<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T03:55:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/545/545b53530534681004454449e6b5e18f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["JHyde"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
