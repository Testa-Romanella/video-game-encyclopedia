{"id": 264491, "slug": "rebel-block", "name": "Rebel Block", "name_original": "Rebel Block", "description": "<p><em>Rebel Block</em>\u00a0is a basic platformer with one interesting gimmick: the entire world is made out of blocks of different materials, and by pressing the down arrow key when standing on a block, you will transform into a copy of it. Each material grants you different properties and abilities. For example, the stone form has\u00a0higher attack and defence power at the cost of\u00a0reduced mobility. Each material type also comes with a special ability e.g. the leaf form allows you to shoot leaf projectiles.<br/></p>\n<p>In the game, you can explore a grand total of three levels, with different themes and block types for each that keep things fresh, as well as new bosses and other challenges to encounter.</p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>This is a GameMaker: Studio game I made in 2014 for a school project. It's definitely very rough around the edges, but I'm still proud of it for what it is. Almost everything in the game I made myself in some way, from the music (using MixCraft), to the art (using my sick MS\u00a0Paint skills), to, of course, the game logic, which I wrote in GML, GameMaker's proprietary programming language.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p><em>(yes, it has one, courtesy of my 14-year-old self)</em></p>\r\nThe concept behind <em>Rebel Block </em>is that the player character was once simply part of the level, a mindless and inanimate piece of the background, but has rebelled and become conscious. This angered the Controller, a being whose purpose is to maintain order within the game world and keep everything as it is. In response to the player\u2019s defiance of the original order of things, the controller created a dangerous maze for the player to traverse, with spikes and enemies intended to impede their progress and return them to their previous state. The player's goal is to reach the Controller, defeat them, and end their reign once and for all.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/508/508c3b234124f6b75838896b21406c63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Dyer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
