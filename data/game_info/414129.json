I had so much fun with this, I used the random generator and got 'Forest, tower defense, survival' and I tried really hard to fit in those genres even if they were a little crazy to mix together :)<br/></p>\n<p>In this game players must gather supplies during the day to use at night when strange shadows start attacking their tent which they must defend. Its up to the player which supplies to prioritize and when best to use them. Hope you enjoy! I'd love any constructive feedback :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:42:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b03/b037d567f0ca8a5b52bed87bcb635d7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ace of Maple"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
