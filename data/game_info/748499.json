This game focuses on the very early years of The Company before it became what Wandrer made it into, and aside from the entity itself borrows little to nothing else from his works. You choose your character&#39;s name and gender and set off down a path of corruption, perversion, and control. As the game progresses, you\\&#39;ll encounter more people to corrupt, and more ways to do it utilizing the various devices and drugs you&#39;ll develop in the Company laboratory.\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T15:09:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bc/5bc2a6859f7312390fcc33c065011e56.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/westane", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
