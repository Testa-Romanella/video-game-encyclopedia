The portals, when both are active in the scene, will extend the player's vision to display what is on the other side of the opposite portal when being looked through, similar to looking through an open door. The enemies spawn in waves such that only one is alive at a time, the location of which being randomly selected from 5 predetermined positions. The player is given a grenade launcher and a pistol which fire projectiles which deal damage to the enemy in hopes of defeat it. Like the player and other entities, these projectiles can travel through portals seamlessly. The enemy is also armed with two weapons and will chase the player around the environment and through portals. In addition, the player also has the option to temporarily slow down the flow of time for all objects other than itself.<br/></p>\n<p>The project was successful in meeting these requirements, though issues with interactions between some of the implemented systems, such as the physics simulations and adjusting the flow of time, caused for some undesirable behaviour, though solutions to this have been discussed. At completion of this project, a demonstration of the key functionality and concepts of the game have been developed, laying the foundation for further expansion into a finalised game.<br/></p>\n<p>~~~~~</p>\n<p>The game is developed in Unity as my Final Year Project (Dissertation).</p>\n<p>I chose to create a game for this, despite not picking the games pathway, as game development was the driving factor to me starting my journey into computer science, so I thought it was fitting to end my degree with a game.</p>\n<p>The project option I selected was for 'A Portal-Styled Game', which was a sponsored option\u00a0from Electric Square. Over the course of my final year, I developed the idea of having the game be a first-person shooter in which enemies spawn and the player must use both portals and a bullet time mechanic to survive.</p>\n<p>For the dissertation, a demo level has been created, though gameplay and functionality is not final.</p>\n<p>~~~~~<br/></p>\n<p>Though the Demo is classed as 'Released', the game is still in development and is planned to be continually worked on in my free time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T09:20:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80f861cd385be272cc0980304c85b040.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kannen Joshi"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
