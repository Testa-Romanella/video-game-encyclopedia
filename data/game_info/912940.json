But taking on an army by yourself is bound to get chaotic so you must use what little you have to come out on top.</p>\n<p>Your character bounces up and down but you can interrupt your movement by shooting or using your rocket pack to avoid enemies. Meaning shooting serves two purposes; movement and offense.</p>\n<p>NOTE that this is a demo that is missing a lot of content as well as an end.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T17:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b26/b26b593ffff2fcf7eab4560c5cd9b5a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vinzenzius"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
