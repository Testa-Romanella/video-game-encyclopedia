Klondike is one of the most played patience games in the world. Now you can enjoy it anytime, and anywhere, on your mobile phone or tablet. Share your Solitaire scores with your friends on Facebook, Twitter and Google+.<br/><br/>From Odesys, the makers of the best solitaire games for mobile.<br/><br/>The goal of Solitaire is to split all cards in the deck into four home stacks, one for each suit. The cards in the home stacks must be placed in ascending order, from Ace to King. Moves to a column must be made in descending order, alternating colors. Multiple cards can be moved from one column to another as long as they are properly ordered. Only a sequence of cards starting with a King can be moved to an empty column.<br/><br/>Odesys respects your privacy!
