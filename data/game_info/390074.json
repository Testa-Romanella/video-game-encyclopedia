In VR, the performer was situated in front of an alter on a floating stone platform in the middle of a swirling maelstrom. As the audience submitted more souls to the website, they entered a queue and one by one the \"summoner\" would perform a specific gesture to sacrifice them. Eventually, enough souls would be sacrificed to allow Blorgramorg to \"break through to the material plane.\"</p>\n\n\n<p>The Demo available here does not include connectivity to an online database of souls, as the original version did, but if you have a Vive, you can play the game to experience what the summoner saw on the night of the event!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T03:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bada1b09eb4e53f7db1a55a88c876acb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CRL"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
