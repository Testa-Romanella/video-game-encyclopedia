Sid without a penny\u00a0to his name and from a poor family just wanted to join in and have some friends. They laughed\u00a0at poor Sid, laughed at his shabby clothes, old toys, his harmless demeanour! He handed the man an olive branch and they knocked it out of his hands, perhaps they\u2019ll respond better to\u00a0REVENGE!\u00a0TAKE EVERYTHING!</p>\n<p>Years later Sid is ready on his quest for revenge! Using some skills he picked up in a con-mans\u00a0handy-book, you will show them who will have the shiniest things at the end of the day!</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u25cf STEAL MONEY FROM YOUR OLD BULLIES' ACCOUNTS\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u25cf USE THE MONEY TO BUIL D YOUR EMPIRE OF STUFF!\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u25cf EARN AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU CAN AND BUY BUY BUY!!!!</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>BUT WATCH OUT!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A smart fraudster is a good fraudster!
