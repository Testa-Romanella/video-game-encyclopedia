When dragging an object, press Q to delete it. Platforms can be rotated with R and scaled with the up/down arrows. When dragging a stick figure, you can press K to kill it, press L to revive it, or right-click to freeze its limb in place. Pressing Z deletes all dead bodies from the world.</p>\n<p>Since I can't afford to purchase advertising, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share my game with your friends and hype them up for its release, if they'd be interested. Thank you. ^-^</p>\n<p>If you have the time, you can submit feedback at\u00a0https://forms.gle/cdwJ1sPg5TYzr5SQA.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T14:03:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/016289aa103ef9f8db3afb135cbc2806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jo Amos"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
