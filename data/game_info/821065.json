It should work in other browsers.)</p><p>Controls are arrow keys to move around and X/Space to jump head first. Press X/Space again to get back up.\u00a0 Land head first on rails to grind on them.\u00a0If an enemy catches you head down you will be taken to the kitchen and turned into stew (not shown on camera).<br/></p>\n<p>On our own planet dice have a rather modest role, principally as playing pieces in games. However, many lightyears away there are other societies where dice play a different role..</p>\n<p>The dice planet has been colonized by onigiri, jaded and hard-hearted after many centuries of seeing their friends and family eaten by humans.\u00a0Now the onigiri are using the dice planet's\u00a0inhabitants as their own foodstuffs. Unable to resist, you have no choice but to leave your homeworld. Escape through the rocket! Don't get kidnapped and eaten!<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the GMTK 2022 game jam. It is a handful of very stupid ideas combined together into an only somewhat cohesive package. I don't relate to dice very much! So this is the best I could come up with.</p>\n<p>There was a game breaking bug where very rarely you would fall through the floor after jumping. I believe I've fixed it, but if it's secretly still there and you find yourself in an unplayable scenario, press R to reset the level.</p>\n\n<p>Music credits:</p>\n<p>\"Divertissement - Pizzicato (from the ballet Sylvia)\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\"Danse Macabre\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\"Gymnopedie No. 2\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T05:51:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc8/fc8d0614a353e56264bbd55dce344723.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["saddleblasters"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
