Playing your own music recommended.</strong></p>\n<p>How to play: To move limbs, aim limb circles with mouse button, hold left click and drag away in desired direction. You will know you are pulling a limb if a string appears between it and the cursor. Release click to release the limb. Body parts will get stuck if they sink into sand, but with some pulling force they can be freed.</p>\n<p>Controls: Mouse and left click to play, space to restart, escape for menu.</p>\n<p>Made in a bit over 48h for\u00a0LD42 theme Running out of Space.</p><p>LD42 entry page:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/quicksand</p>\n<p><em>Amazing ride this LD. The concept I chose to work on (on Saturday late night) turned out more challenging than I pretended it is, and the game itself almost drowned in the sand as its main character. What came out is neither a decent quicksand nor human body simulator, but perhaps a good video for some slow or slightly depressing music. And watching that guy sink turned out pleasing in some way, what more can I ask for. Looks better live than on screenshots I promise :P</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a54/a54f2f72211d5be3ded9f986e392f98b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Krafter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
