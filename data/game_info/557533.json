Some text may have distorted and produced different shades of red but that wasn't my intention.</p>\n<p>The game has 5 levels, a tutorial and a boss fight, it is pretty short but very difficult if you don't use the spell.</p>\n<p>I made 9 enemies, 4 of which are only more powerful versions of others.</p>\n<p>The game is difficult, if it is too difficult to be fun I will tone it down a bit.</p>\n<p>The music was made by Stef If (thx).</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback I\u00a0would appreciate it, thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T10:13:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f9/9f96a7f7ebcde0869284816a00e49647.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Barbu David Constantin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
