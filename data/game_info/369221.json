But honestly is there anything better than swords (especially ones named Big Axe Momma) ?<br/><br/>It goes like this: the knight kills enemies, you get loot and merge it, he kills more enemies, you get more loot. Easy enough, right?<br/><br/>You can choose whenever you want to grind, kill bosses for more slots, build a more tanky knight...the choice is yours. And did I mention there is a lot of swords in this game?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T02:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/881/881665a7b98abb0dc0e54fb3c46f8ba9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Orbital Knight"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Orbital Knight"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
