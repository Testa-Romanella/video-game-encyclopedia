Will you go for the loot or backstab a creeping horror? As you scavenge, fight and sneak to new encounters, the ring reacts to your actions.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay as fast or slow as you like in this challenging, turn-based roguelike. Just be careful where you tread - You may find yourself ambushed, or worse...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSee the outcome of your choices so you can focus on decisions. \n<br/>\nCreatures broadcast their actions in a hostile environment, ready to erupt. Will you flee or find a way to use the dungeon against itself? \n<br/>\nPositioning is key to survival. You can be quickly overwhelmed...\n<br/>\n<br/>\nObserve the Ring and strategise.\n<br/>\nLearn, adapt, or face demise.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMimics offer you a choice for a price. Take what you can hold and build a combination of gear with passive powers. \n<br/>\nMaybe you\u2019ll be quick and evasive, with an acid soaked blade. Or maybe you\u2019ll be a brute force juggernaut, or a fireborn damage sink with an affinity for explosions. \n<br/>\nBuy your way to power or adapt with what you scavenge in these unforgiving depths.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeep in the Ring of Pain you will discover new paths into the unknown. Places with new friends, powerful loot, and cryptic rhyming lore.\n<br/>\nFind pleasant reprieve and howling terrors best left undisturbed.\n<br/>\nThe brave may be rewarded for their risk... or crushed by their ambition. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn darkness, careful where you tread.\n<br/>\nWhat was unknown now fills with dread.\n<br/>\n\n\n\nRing of Pain launches Oct 15th with these features and more:<ul><li>16 Core path dungeons plus 2 branching endings to test your final build.\n<br/>\n</li><li>2 Hard mode items to unlock for those who thrive on pain.\n\n<br/>\n</li><li>25+ Special dungeons to detour through, filled with loot and strange encounters.\n<br/>\n</li><li>4 Environment regions with their own flavour of terror.\n<br/>\n</li><li>180+ items to unlock and combine in a 15 slot inventory.\n<br/>\n</li><li>40+ Creatures to learn and adapt to.
