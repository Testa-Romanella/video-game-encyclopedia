{"id": 2960, "slug": "towerfall", "name": "TowerFall Ascension", "name_original": "TowerFall Ascension", "description": "<p>TowerFall is an indie action-game with focus on local multiplayer. It was initially developed as an exclusive for OUYA microconsole and was later ported on other systems as TowerFall Ascension. The gameplay represents an arcade-style fighting arena where four people combat each other to score points in a series of rounds. There are for several characters to choose from in the game. Every one of them has two main ways of killing opponents: bow and stomping. Every player starts with only 3 arrows which, after being shot, can be picked from the spot where they fell. The player can also jump on each other in retro-platformer style. The arenas exit is connected with exits on the opposite side of the map, so if the player falls down the pit, he immediately appears from the top of the arena. There also several powerups that can be found in treasure chest scattered across the map.  <br />\nThe Ascension version of the game also features single-player mode in which player has to kill waves of enemies on the arena. It has no story whatsoever and is more like a series of challenges with different monsters, powerups and unique peculiarities on locations.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2013-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-19T12:29:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b61/b6193c5c1f917f38dce568f335f80c16.jpg", "website": "http://www.towerfall-game.com", "rating": 3.94, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 122, "owned": 1750, "beaten": 121, "toplay": 23, "dropped": 134, "playing": 17}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 122, "ratings_count": 287, "suggestions_count": 397, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 290, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PS Vita", "PlayStation 4", "Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Matt Makes Games", "Matt Thorson"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Matt Makes Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
