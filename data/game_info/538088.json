Your job is to gather materials by blasting apart asteroids pulled toward the Asteroid Harvesters Vessel 'The Commons' so the faction can grow their wealth. Using some of the profits, you can then upgrade your ship's offensive, defensive, and storage capabilities in order to reap more rewards. However, if you perish, the faction can always replace you, and use the profits to give the new recruits an easier time.\u00a0 Just keep that in mind.<br/><br/>The game is a shoot-em-up game with the ability to upgrade your ship, as well has making the choice to spend materials on upgrades, or sell them for more money since the value of money may go down. Fight through 35 days of asteroid harvesting.<br/><br/>This game was intended to being a mobile release, and may still be. Once we have enough time on our hands, we have plans to expand the game drastically. Currently there are 35 days in the game, and there are plans of 100. We hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T03:19:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b07/b07df204824fe85a83ef83db07e2b28b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aidan_099"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
