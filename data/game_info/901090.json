These controls are available to view by clicking the controller icon next to the game. \u00a0Mouse input is not recognised by PICO-8, although you may need to click on the game window before it recognises other inputs. </p>\n\r\nPlay\r\n\n<p>Try your best to rack up a high score, or alternatively try to beat the game as quickly as possible!\u00a0</p>\n\r\nDeveloper's Notes\r\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy my game!
