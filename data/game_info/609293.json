What is this, Clone Hour?</p>\n<p>Wrong! YGOPro:\u00a0Circuit of the Soul boasts 5 (more to come) custom made cards, a brand-new custom type, and retains almost all the lovely features of YGOPro. However, we do have a downside. We do not yet have an official Server for the game to use for an online mode. So, for now, LAN mode will need to be used (You can use apps like Hamachi and ZeroTier to use it with friends. So it's like having your own private server!)\u00a0however, you will retain all the current cards and new cards will be added soon. We do not have a team to make the cards that aren't official past release, so sadly, any official cards that are missing might <strong>not be added</strong>. It's a sacrifice, but we do promise that they will live on in some form.<br/><br/>Completely customisable!</p>\n<p>New cards will be added!<br/>Support Discord coming soon.<br/>New card type: Soul!<br/></p>\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Power your Circuit with the soul strength that matters!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T07:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/304/3040321d2967f8e7312c817ca5247c3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueWingOfDawn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
