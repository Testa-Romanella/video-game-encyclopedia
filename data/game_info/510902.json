Every room is almost like a puzzle as you try\u00a0to figure out the best way to defeat all enemies without taking too much damage.<br/></p>\n\n<p>You play as an adventurer entering the Labyrinth with nothing but a dull sword. Worry not! Each loot you find will grant you a unique ability that will help you slay monsters and find <em>even more loot</em><em>!</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Descend to the deepest level of the Labyrinth and defeat the evil hideous demon lord to win!<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li><strong>You are what you wear</strong> - Your abilities are based entirely on the items you have equipped. No levels, no experience, no grinding. You can choose to be an axe-wielding berserker, a spell-obsessed wizard, or anything in between! You can even change your mind and switch in the middle of the run.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Quick sessions </strong>- Each playthrough only lasts about an hour or two. Way shorter if you die early!</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Simple, streamlined mechanics</strong> - There are only 3 basic stats: your health, mana, and your attack damage. Attacks don't miss and enemy patterns are predictable.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>High replayability</strong> - Over a hundred unique items and abilities, over fifty modifiers for each item, and a unique legendary modifier for every item. This combined with randomly generated dungeons ensures that no two playthroughs are alike!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T05:41:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70b/70ba41c35792b1817e06c6650c887604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dominaxis Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
