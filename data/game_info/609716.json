I remember more than I thought I did but I did learn one or two things too!\u00a0This game never ends unless you die. So far, there's no levels or any kinds of dangers or enemies aside from asteroids but that'll change soon!</p>\n<p>For now, there's waves of asteroids! Dodge or shoot them, it's up to you but you get points towards the\u00a0challenge of getting as high a score as you can by taking them out.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<strong>WASD</strong>Ship Movement<strong>Left Mouse Button</strong>Fire Shots\r\n<p>Pretty basic stuff for now but I'll be getting enemies and more hazards in soon. I may even build it for phones!<br/></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>BTW Unity is really unrelaible at actually building for WebGL and saving scene changes when I manually save.</p>\n<p>This is the second project in a row where I've saved my scene and then saved the project as a whole before building just to have the build process crash and then remove or corrupt objects/prefabs within my scenes and project. Luckily I've been able to fix things quickly once I've figured out what the issues are but this better not be a consistent issue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T09:21:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50d/50dbecea5424f8559f3a97783c0241f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sarah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
