Players can join public or private 1v1 lobbies to engage in 1st person spaceship combat, using lasers to try and destroy their opponent's ship. Movement is especially tricky because of inertia and the lack of air resistance, and it adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay. Good aim and a mastery of spaceship movement are necessary to win.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T03:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5f3dd6efd8997c8f01a84b324766adb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benjamin Chen"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Benjamin Chen"], "esrb_rating": null}
