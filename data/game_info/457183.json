You play a miner in a cave, trying to do your best in earning as much money as you can while keeping the environment safe at the same time.<br/></p>\n<p>In the game you mine for ores by clicking on the mine while standing close to it, you need to transfer those ores to the truck to get you money and after the truck is filled you get to the shop. You use the money you get from the ores to buy upgrades which make your work much easier and enjoyable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first glance, it looks that keeping the environment clean doesn\u2019t matter, but as the player progresses in the game, he sees the effects on the player's surroundings and the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game lasts a month (in-game time) and there are plenty of upgrades for the player to choose from in the shop. Some of them are good for the environment and others are good for making money. Examples for such upgrades are gaining more stones from mining, making the drill crate less pollution from being used, and many others.</p>\n<p>We believe this game is different from the normal clicker game genre because the player choices do matter and are shown to him. For that same reason the game can be repeated and played in different styles so the player won't lose their enjoyment.</p>\n<p><strong><em>You play the miner that has to make smart decisions to succeed in your work while keeping a healthy business and keeping the environment safe/ clean.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Team Members:</strong><br/>Yuval V.\u00a0 Team leader<br/>Tamir S.</p>\n<p><strong>Made for Windows!</strong></p><p><strong><br/>Academic Supervision:</strong></p>\n<p>Dr. Elhanan Gazit Ph.D | juloot founder <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/588/5884a74dc94b245382a0e8159ebc0de2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WizTeam"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
