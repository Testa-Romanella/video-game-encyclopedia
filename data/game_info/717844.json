Revolt takes place in the city of Esmeralda \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 a beautiful city rich with canals filled with water and streets that can take you to anywhere in the city. While Esmeralda looks old, it is in fact a technological marvel \u2013 almost like an Atlantis. The player plays as a long-time resident blacksmith named Edric. Edric, along with the help of a small group of revolutionists, must do what he can to disturb the peace just enough to trigger an uprising. In this game, players must complete tasks to show that the revolutionist groups are trying to help the people from the tyrannical monarch who is oppressing them. Players must use a combination of skills which include walking, jumping, sneaking around guards, and talking to NPCs to learn new information on ways to help the people of Esmeralda.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>WASD - Walking</p>\n<p>SHIFT - Hold to Run</p>\n<p>SPACEBAR - Jump</p>\n<p>TAB - Throw Dynamite</p>\n<p>T - Talk/Interact with NPCs/Objects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T05:38:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8c/c8c7f5889782831aefde67d69714913a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["zeeshanbaig"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
