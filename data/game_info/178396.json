If nothing went wrong in the meantime, online should still work due to the peer-to-peer architecture of the game.</p><p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae3b6eb56690bfbf1cacd9247797209c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobstudios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
