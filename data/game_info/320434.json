However, the closer you get to your dream end of service, the more you get the impression that the whole world is against you. The prison administration imposes every day incriminating duties that you have to fulfill before the end of each day, because otherwise you can fly out of here faster than you would like. But on the other side of the barricade we have prisoners with different sins on their conscience, which your devotion to work can be very unattractive. If you go too much to the imprint, it can end tragically for you!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow to live?!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBalance between tasks for the prison management, and small requests from convicts to maintain the relationship between the two sides on the most neutral level! Declaring only on one side will not pay you in any way!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe duties of the key<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a key you will have many tasks such as accepting new prisoners, searching a prison cell<br/>\r\nand prisoners in order to find contraband, confiscating convict objects, reviewing monitoring, maintaining order and security, pacifying problematic prison residents, executions, and much more.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFreedom of the simulator<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDespite the tasks and limited time, Prison Simulator offers you complete freedom! You can do whatever you like, remembering that your loose actions and behaviors may also affect relations with prison employees as well as with convicts themselves ... especially when you pacify them very often and for no good reason.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCampaign or free play<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can both play in the campaign mode with divided time and responsibilities, as well as play in free play mode, where you are not limited by any time or task! Do whatever you like, search prison cells and confiscate illegal items in an unconventional way, interact with the whole environment, visit the farthest corners of the prison or just kick some butts and not necessarily the prisoners' butts.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96c/96ca4abc25561eba1cdd68671170ca53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameBoom VR"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay"], "esrb_rating": null}
