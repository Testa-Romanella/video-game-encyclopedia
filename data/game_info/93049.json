{"id": 93049, "slug": "pvrotect-the-castle", "name": "PVRotect The Castle", "name_original": "PVRotect The Castle", "description": "<p><strong>PVRotect the Castle</strong> is a VR game (I mean, c'mon, you totally already knew that because I put \"VR\" in the title) that lets you protect a castle (I mean, c'mon, you totally already knew that because I put \"Protect the Castle\" in the title). Fight off waves (wait, a wave-based VR game?.. totally haven't seen that before, amirite?) of little stick dudes and stop 'em from messing up your sweet castle.</p>Controls<ul><li>Just, like, reach down and grab stuff. Use the triggers to squeeze your lil' VR fingers. Squish the enemies in your preferred manner.</li><li>For buttons, touch them and squeeze the trigger (intuitive, no?)</li></ul>Handy tips and stuff<ul><li>If you aren't one of those lucky dudes who has like a huge extra room to play VR in ( #firstWorldPVRoblems) and things get a little cramped, try rotating the play area from the main menu to see if that helps.</li><li>The game is kinda roomscale-y, though, so if your place is too small in both directions, then I hereby waive all liability when you break something...</li></ul><p>In all seriousness, though, this game is just a lil' project I worked on in my free time. I have a lot more ideas for how I want to make it better, but not sure how much more time I wanna put into it (too many other projects going on), so this may (or may not?) be as finished as it gets. I encourage feedback though, because even if I don't fix it in this game, it might help me grow as a game developer. Anyway, I hope you enjoy!</p><p>Props to Unity, Valve, Blender, and the folks who work on VRTK for making awesome tools to make stuff like this possible for a guy to make in his living room.</p><p>VRTK: https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bec/bec980a4aecc8c6dd77c33dfbf634541.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bryndsey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
