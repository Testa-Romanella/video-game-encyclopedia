Let's put an end to this by taking down their not-too-cute and very-much-annoying machines!</p>\n<p><strong>Dewind is a submission for Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2</strong><br/></p>\r\nQuick intro to game mechanics\r\n<p>These time-altering machines seem to affect you less than everyone else, but it doesn't mean they're not going to turn you into an innocent monkey soon. To counteract the time-altering force you must constantly move. Moving will build up your TimeSlide powerbar and allow you to use it's effects to your advantage. Use your primitive self to jump greater distances and escape pitfalls, enjoy augmented firepower in your future self, and -of course- take-em-down with... yourself!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong> Music does not play properly on the WebGL Player.\u00a0 Please download a desktop build for maximum enjoyment, since Osito (@mncarballo) put a lot of effort into it!</p>\r\nGame art\r\nThe \"Rewind Machine Boss\":\r\n\r\nCyborg Character:\r\n\r\n\r\nNot implemented yet:\r\n\r\nMech Evolution Stage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Concept art of our Game:\r\n\r\nThis game was made in only one week", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T05:24:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ee/7ee2e3e2017eb92d36dd2468c550a177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["mock-angel", "Osito", "FryingPandaZip", "age401", "Fynn Frings"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
