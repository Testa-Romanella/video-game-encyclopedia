Now it was just me, my office and my very first case.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll guide new PI Amira Darma through her first day in the detective business, managing your new agency, using real-world research to crack cases, and taking on one of three clients, each with their own story and secrets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The world is in a state of flux as the global economy nears the nadir of its decade-long collapse. Singapore stands as a last refuge of order but even here the government struggles on the brink of chaos. Private detectives are now the first call for those citizens able to afford a semblance of justice...<br/><br/><strong>Rupert Zhou: The Fixer</strong><br/><br/>Rupert was the go-to man for the city\u2019s elite. Who knew what was hiding behind that implacable expression? One way or another, I was going to find out.<br/><br/>A park, a bench, a midnight rendezvous, Rupert had a flair for the dramatic.

But this strength is also his weakness. Can a man like him survive in a town like this?<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Lion City your choices matter, and your actions will change the course of Singapore\u2019s future. Even on her first day, Amira will make decisions that could help get the city back on track...or send it spiralling into chaos.<br/><br/>Use your own real-life detective skills to solve the cases, choose a side, and take your first steps towards unravelling a global conspiracy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T02:07:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6b8dced597700487f48ace29461df5d.jpg", "website": "http://www.generalinteractive.co/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["General Interactive Co."], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WhisperGames", "General Interactive Co."], "esrb_rating": null}
