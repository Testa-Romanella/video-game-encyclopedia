I decided it would be fun to make a game with my fianc\u00e9 for Ludum\u00a0Dare 51. She had never done anything gamedev related and never done pixel art before so she learned everything over the weekend including how to use the tools. I am really happy how we did regardless. I hope you like it!</p>\r\nOVERVIEW\r\n<p>You and your trusty wheelbarrow have set out to harvest crops on the farm but it's become overgrown with weeds. Also these pesky birds keep pooping on your shed. You must cut down the weeds to find crops so you can get upgrades to help you go deeper in the farmlands to find the precious golden apple.\u00a0</p>\r\nFarming Phase\r\n<p>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf3e Cut down weeds to find hidden crops and venture further into the farmlands</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf3e Use your wheelbarrow to send crops back to the shed</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf3e Every 10 seconds the sunflower loses a petal **(once all petals are gone birds will attack your shed)**</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf3e Every 10 seconds animals/bugs will appear and try to raid your crops **(raided crops are dimmed)**</p>\r\nDefending Phase\r\n<p>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf3e Climb up the ladder in the shed to fight off the pesky birds</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf3e Purchase upgrades in the shed to help you along your way</p>\r\nTIPS\r\n<p>* You can attack 2 weeds/crops at once if you attack diagonally in a corner</p>\n<p>* The music changes when the sunflower petals run out</p>\n<p>* Crops that the animals raided are dimmed and only give you 1 crop\u00a0</p>\n<p>* Getting close to animals scares them (! is above their head) . when they are scared they can't raid the crops</p>\n<p>* The wheelbarrow automatically returns crops if you fill it up with 12 crops</p>\n<p>* You can only carry as many crops as the wheelbarrow has storage for</p><p>* You can make the wheelbarrow follow you even when it has 0 crops. just press space and run away</p>\n<p>* If you run into a bug use F5 key to restart\u00a0</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>-----------------------</p>\r\nGAMEPAD SUPPORTED\r\n<p><strong>GAMEPAD DPAD</strong>\u00a0 = <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A BUTTON</strong>\u00a0= <strong>SPACE</strong></p>\n<p>------------------------</p>\n<p>press <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong>\u00a0(or <strong>WASD</strong>) to <strong>move</strong>.
