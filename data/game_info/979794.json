The problem is that he has already had WAY too many! You need to collect all of the the pills in the facility so that he doesn't eat any more. <br/><br/>Be careful though...The Cube REALLY likes his pills...<br/><br/>Inspired by previous indie horror games, join the Red Cube and the rest of the hospital staff in a search for the pills in a first person shooter horror experience! Use the stun gun to stun the cube before he gets you and reload at the vending machines when needed. You also need to watch out for the hospital staff and make sure they don't get in your way. You will need to avoid the doctor, the nurse, and the facility house spider and not get caught by their antics which can slow you down.<br/><br/>- Collect the 9 pills while avoiding the Red Cube.<br/>- Don't get lost in the maze of hospital rooms.<br/>- Use your stun gun to temporarily freeze the Red Cube (you will need it).<br/>- Reload the stun gun by standing next to 1 of 3 vending machines for 5 seconds.<br/>- Avoid the Doctor.<br/>- Avoid the Nurse.<br/>- Avoid the Spider.<br/><br/>[Warning] This game does contain jump scares and spider scares, play at your own risk.<br/><br/>This game is designed to be challenging (I can barely beat it myself).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T06:31:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e47adfb623c7a821a03f46a95f00a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh Ward"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Josh Ward"], "esrb_rating": null}
