Fortify your pockets and ready your attacks in the build phase, then fire your cue balls and ricochet, blast, and slime your way to victory in the pool phase!\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two build rounds, where each player is allotted 50 gold to purchase power balls. Left click on the entries to purchase the balls and left click on the board (on your side!) to place your selection.</p>\n<p>Once the Pool Phase begins, players take turns left clicking any cue ball on their side of the board, and then dragging and releasing the cursor to launch the cue ball. If you land any of your balls in your opponents pockets, that's a point! If a cue ball, or any of your opponent's balls land in your pockets, that's a scratch!</p>\n<p>First player to six points wins! Don't get snookered!</p>\n<p>(Win conditions may be a bit borked depending on circumstances. In the event that you can't reach 6 points or the game doesn't end properly, just use the honor system and see who has more points.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T08:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e07/e0780c038d8d40656037ff9a439c7e13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ryankann"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
