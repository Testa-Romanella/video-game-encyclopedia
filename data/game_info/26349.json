You're going to experience something extraordinary that will \n      really test your reflexes. The game contains a series of tutorials that \n      will teach you not only how to control your fishie, but also the various \n      game modes. In Fishie Fishie, you are a fish that has to eat all the \n      time. You also have to finish several different game modes as quickly as \n      possible. Every second counts. To win, you'll have to get through over a \n      hundred levels spread over seven game modes: \u201cstory\u201d, \u201csoccer\u201d, \u201ccapture \n      the star\u201d, \u201csurvival\u201d, \u201cskill\u201d and a large competition. You can play \n      solo, or up to four people can play on the same screen. In co-op mode or \n      every fishie for himself, it's no holds barred to win.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a3/2a319896e5115b033826e4eda041b56e.jpg", "website": "http://www.dk-games.com/FishieFishie/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["DK-GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
