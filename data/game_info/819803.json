We took the theme literally and created a \"charming\"\u00a0, infinite world in which a lone die rolls about in order to fill the void with a\u00a0\"beautiful\" landscapes by combining the die faces in our relaxing puzzle game \"TBD: To Be Diced\".</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the die</li><li>Combine faces on your die with tiles on the ground in order to merge them together and unlock new faces for your die</li><li>After moving the die, its bottom face will be randomly assigned a new value</li></ul>\r\nIdea\r\n<p>This is obviously rather a tech demo than an actual game. The main idea was to create a nice and relaxing atmosphere in which the player has to make decisions on how to move the die and build the world. We never really got passed the implementation point of the features, so the atmospheric part is lacking.</p>\n<p>Things we liked to do but couldn't due to the time constraint of 48h:</p>\n<ul><li>A small indicator HUD showing the player which move would lead to which result (e.g.\u00a0\u2192 would lead to a grass tile)</li><li>The tiles themselves emit sounds (birds chirping, water flowing, etc.). The more tiles of the same type would be present on the screen, the more intense the sound gets</li><li>More field types and more combinations</li><li>Combinations of tiles in the world (e.g. 3x3 fields would combine to 3x3 forest, leading to more ways to unlock fields)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:24:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5ef6cc690625f91300dbcb18b19ef78a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zudragon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
