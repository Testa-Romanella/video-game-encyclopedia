You wake up and try to escape the basement because it's locked, by the weird things that appear. When you are a step away from leaving it, you go asleep again, then wake up in the same place, with other weird things happening, and it's the same day. And it happens for nearly 3 days, because in the 4th, you leave it normally. Weird experience, right?</p>\n<p>There are 2 gameplay levels and 2 story-based levels, which result in a total of 4 levels, which are short.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T08:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/349e74150512805e2ef324ce17dd22e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuresoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
