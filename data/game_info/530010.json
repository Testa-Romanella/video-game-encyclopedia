{"id": 530010, "slug": "ringlad", "name": "Ringlad", "name_original": "Ringlad", "description": "<p>Ringlad is a lad who likes to fly through rings.<br/>Made as part of the Variety Megajam 2020, where the theme was an image of a ring and making a game that takes around 10 minutes to play. To go with the theme of 10, I made 10 levels for Ringlad :)<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>Click to fire and launch Ringlad; fly through all the rings to progress to the next level, and don't forget to watch your ammo!</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p>I made this in a little over 1 day, so there are several things I was too lazy to implement (or at least, not properly; cough cough UI cough). I never got a timer into the finished project but I\u00a0feel like the movement would lend itself well to speedrunning. Just saying, if anyone wants to try it then I'd love to see how it goes haha</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter to keep up with the rest of my entries to this awesome game jam and anything else I work on in the future:\u00a0https://twitter.com/kruxedev<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:54:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ae/6ae2c12b6347ea638a704f8e8f23073f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kruxe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
