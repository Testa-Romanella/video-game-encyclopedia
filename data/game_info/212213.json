The majority of the assets and the concepts behind the game logic came from the official Unity tutorial located here: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial.This is a \"nearly final\" version with just about everything I wanted to implement after the tutorial's conclusion.</p><p>It should be noted that the tutorial was created with a previous version of Unity and several things had to be updated for Unity 5. There's an upgrade guide in the link to the tutorial, and any gaps that guide may have are addressed in the Youtube comments.</p><p>Feel free to leave any feedback or comments about stuff you think would be cool or beneficial to include or learn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fellergames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
