As indies, each\u00a0do much more than their main role, though.</em>\n<p>The team first met online Early-2018, when Gabeux contacted Kirthos to request permission to use his mods in a modpack of a sandbox game. Mariana, Gabeux's sweetheart,\u00a0assisted them with art and feedback\u00a0in their modding efforts. Kirthos soon introduced his childhood friend\u00a0Liolilol, who had studied and\u00a0worked with him in past videogame projects and prototypes.<br/></p>\n<p>After months of joking around the idea of going indie and making a game together, by the end of 2018 Kirthos and Lio silently started work on a prototype named TownCity. One month later, after inviting Gabeux and Mari over to aid with\u00a0development, TownCity soon became\u00a0Tech Age Rebellion and development continued in the spare time of the team's members - with Kirthos leading the technical development full-time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:34:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3e/b3e7cf5b7915300e87a86deefa214796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Compiled Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
