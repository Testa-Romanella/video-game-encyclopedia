Civil unrest grips the North Pole. Santa Claus, a Rockefeller-ian captain of industry and a figure of hope and progress, has fallen on hard times. His once insurmountable manufacturing empire has given up massive ground to the dual-pronged threat of overseas production and digital distribution. <br/><br/>In order to keep up with a changing manufacturing landscape, Santa decided to automate his workshop by installing a mechanized, robotic production system led by an Artificial Intelligence named P.A.L. (Polar Algorithmic Computer). For the first few months, everything seemed copacetic. Then came an efficiency test\u2026 that Santa, by dint of being flesh and blood as opposed to mechanical marvel, inevitably failed. P.A.L. repurposed the once-peaceful robo-elf manufacturing arm into an army bent on assassination, and set out to wipe Santa from the face of the Earth. Why? To maximize profits, of course! <br/><br/>Enter Nick\u2014Santa Claus\u2019 badass survivalist alter ego. Nick\u2019s on the run, evading and fighting P.A.L.\u2019s robot forces as he traverses the Polar wasteland. Fueled by weapons-grade eggnog and righteous Christmas wrath, he's made it to his final outpost: a remote satellite workshop originally meant for experimental toy R&amp;D. Here, Nick readies his defenses, makes peace with his maker and prepares to make his last stand in.
