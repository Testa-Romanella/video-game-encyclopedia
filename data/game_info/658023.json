My 4th Amiga game,\u00a0I originally released this game in June 1992.</p>\n<p>One On One is a two-player only combat game. Two tanks face off in a maze-like arena and both players use a joystick. You can't about turn, so there is a slight advantage to sneaking up behind your opponent. There is no AI play, so the game is only useful when playing with a friend.</p><p>It's a very simple game, originally made in about two weeks.\u00a0It was my first two-player game,\u00a0made to play with my brother (we used to play the cave flyer Bratwurst all of the time).</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T06:14:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/564/564f964cf20ceb949013e5282aeded2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
