You choose.</p>\r\nA mix between Hotline Miami and a cop thriller.\r\n<p>You are a police officer that through his investigation will have moral choices to make, you can either arrest the suspects, or get high* on their supply while you execute them point blank, the choices you make will change the ending and how you play.</p>\r\n*Up to three drugs to use, all with different effects, baptized weed lets you see enemies trough walls, cocaine makes you tougher, and Noxyophine is the good old slow motion.\r\nControls:\r\n<p>W,A,S,D - move.<br/>E - Interact.<br/>Spacebar - arrest stunned enemies.<br/>F - Surrender enemies.<br/>1,2,3 - Change selected drug.<br/>Q - Use selected\u00a0drug.<br/>Left mouse button - Shoot/attack.<br/>Right mouse button - Stun enemies with batton.<br/>R - Restart level.<br/>Esc - Exit game.</p>\r\nMade for the \"Broken Pickaxe Jam 2022\", the theme was \"Dirty and Clean\", my interpretation was to make a game where the player can trough his actions become a clean or dirty cop, these decisions can change the story and ending.\r\n<p>The game is in an early state, so everything is still subject to improvement.
