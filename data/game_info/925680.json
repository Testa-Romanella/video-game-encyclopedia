In Normal Verse, you can\u00a0 be a programmer,\u00a0taking a dip in the sea of codes and making bugs, or be a technical artist, making the best Grass Material with NormalMap from NormalUniverse,\u00a0 absorbing energy from Normal Bagel!</p>\n<p>I made this game with my friend NINI, we are both technical artist so we thought about making sth about our job, as u can see there are codes, bug,\u00a0normal map and\u00a0material editor in our game. As for gameplay, \"GROWTH\" reminds us of EATING and becoming BIGGER (or something), like Pacman and Retro Snake, so we mixed them together :-) The game is very short and\u00a0just ends with \"thank you\" cuz we didn't have much time to finish it ;-(\u00a0\u00a0Maybe we will finish it in the future :o)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/806/806bc4e1775049e3b99d0133d565daf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JamieWu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
