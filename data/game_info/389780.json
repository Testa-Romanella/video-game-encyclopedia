Now it's looking for a strong, able-body to click it until there is nothing left to click.</p>\n\n<p>This is a small project I created in just one day; it's an incredibly short game but hopefully you'll get a kick out of it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you guys have any ideas of small things I can do to improve it, let me know! It's just a practice project but I try and apply everything I learn to each of these.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits for Sandwich Clicker 3000</p>\n<p> Everything that isn't listed below was made by me.
