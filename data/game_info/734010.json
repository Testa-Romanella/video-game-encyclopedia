To do so, you rotate the globe on which the farmer stands on to affect what is receiving sunlight. By balancing day and night, heat and cold, growth and drought, you aim to help his farm grow. This was made for Global Game Jam 2022, based on the theme \"Duality\" and made in the Azusa Pacific University site. Use left and right arrows to rotate the globe in the intended direction. As objects enter and leave the sun, said objects change in properties. The sunny side is warm and keeping objects underneath the rays for too long can make them a little too warm. Meanwhile, the opposite side of the planet is dark and cold.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>personal plug: (I'm also looking for work in game dev) visit my basic web site (and click the menu in the top right to get to my socials):\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://talec.github.io/Eckmann_modern_portfolio/\r\n</p>\n<p>----</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T09:03:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbfe5af2af57753a8d428ae377e7b698.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Talec"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
