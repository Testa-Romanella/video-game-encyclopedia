Pandas that obsess about something in their past life. (Check the intro panels for the story in the game)</p>\n<p>This project started out as a 4 month game where I coded everything from the ground up in Unity and developed all the assets myself. As of creating this game page (30 November) the game has been 3 months in development and I have created a demo version for you to have a look at and provide feedback if you wish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The demo will have 10 of the 100 days of the story as well as a few other limitations that you can read about on the tutorial panels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for giving it a go.\u00a0All donations are very much appreciated and will help me continue working on this (and other games) full time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Mainly left button interaction with the mouse</p>\n<p>- Right click on inventory items will enlarge them</p>\n<p>- Right click and drag will move the skill tree as well as when starting the explore area so you can have a look at the blueprint of the building a bit better</p>\n<p>- Scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the skill tree and explore area</p>\n<p>All systems apart from the \"Town Explore\" and \"Home interior\" are complete. It is now just about creating more content and better menu transitions and UI work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All feedback appreciated!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T10:18:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/321/32123845d3f829be902a91e6fae09879.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GVR Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
