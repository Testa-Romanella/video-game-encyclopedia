One of these machines is P107, code named \"Boulder\"\u00a0for its ability to roll at high speeds and ram into enemies. A test exercise has been arranged in order to display Boulder's capabilities.</p>\n<p>This is a short game made for a Game Design class in which the assignment was to create a game using a player character who is a sphere. Boulder (along with the rest of the Poly line that does not show up in this game) are characters I created a long time ago and I figured\u00a0I'd just go ahead and use him. This game was originally going to be much different, but the first concept turned out to be me biting off\u00a0a bit more than I\u00a0could chew as a beginner.\u00a0Oh well, maybe next time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1ebdb2e9230cb5310f2308d522c66845.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thedobaga"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
