{"id": 729094, "slug": "echosearch", "name": "Echosearch", "name_original": "Echosearch", "description": "<p>Following the theme of \"Empty World,\" this game takes place almost entirely on an empty black screen. You'll have to rely on sound cues to lead your search and make the world a little less empty, all while avoiding the snarls and footsteps of a creature that is hunting you in the darkness.<br/></p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>The mouse cursor is you. Move it around and listen closely for noises around you (This game is best played with headphones). Your objective is to find the three animals that are roaming around and click on them. The obstacle here is that there is something else roaming around trying to find you as well. Moving the mouse cursor and clicking will create noise; the more noise you make, the easier it is for the beast to figure out where you are. Listen carefully, avoid rushing, and if you hear something charging at you, it's probably best to get out of the way.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T10:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29c/29c53b4ff69dafdee13fee1fa11df696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Darien"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
