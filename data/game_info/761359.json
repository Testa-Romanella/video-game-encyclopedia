Each level is set with a task system. The town is the first level. Players need to complete the collection task before they can be included in the next level<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*Because the character uses a robot, the game has an energy bar in addition to a health bar. When the game runs, the energy will be consumed automatically. When it returns to zero, the character will be judged dead. Therefore, the player needs to find the material box to supplement energy and ammunition before the energy is exhausted, and enter the next level before the energy is exhausted, The difficulty of the game is to complete the task before the energy is exhausted<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*As a shooting game, the game adds two guns, assault rifles and sniper guns. When using assault rifles, grenades can also be used to destroy zombies. When zombies gather together, grenades have a good killing effect<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*In terms of the operation method of the game, the setting of the key position controlling the basic movement is the same as that of other types of shooting games, and some are added on the basis, such as key positions 1 and 2: switching firearms, key position 4: grenade launch, key position M: opening the map, and the item pickup is automatic<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*As for some other functions and playing methods of the game, players need to develop them themselves<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*Of course, you should not expect too much from the game. The game is just a graduation project of your own. Due to technical and knowledge constraints, there will be many bugs in the game. Maybe players have a lot of problems when playing, but please forgive me. After all, this is only a graduation project, which is certainly not comparable to other games and will encounter bugs. If you are interested, I hope you can support the game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T03:30:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b10/b10bff149e06fab6aafe0bdd39e6766f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ma Tang Ying"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ma Tang Ying"], "esrb_rating": null}
