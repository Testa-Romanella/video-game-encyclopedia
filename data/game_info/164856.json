I wanted to make a game to better my skills, so I began developing a spin-off of the classic Atari game \"Space Invaders\". Once I began development, I thought it would be fun to give it a Star Wars theme.</p><p>I am very happy with how this turned out. There were many features I wanted to add to this, but It was time to move onto the next project.</p><p>Please ignore video frame-rate as performance is much better in-game.</p><p>Website: https://releasethespartan.wordpress.com/</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/MillarBrandon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cab/cab2bd544658637da2f62299136df06a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Low Orbit Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
