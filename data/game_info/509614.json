Monsters freely roamed the land and the Gods gave blessings on a daily basis. Truly, it was a hero\u2019s haven, if you knew where to go. Recently, there have been tales of a new creature roaming the land, Medusa. She is said to have the ability to turn anyone foolish enough to challenge her to stone. Are you foolish enough to test this tale? Or will you let glory slip from your grasp?</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Featuring a diverse cast of quirky characters with unique dialogue based on how you play the game\u00a0</li><li>Dozens of spells, armors, and weapons to find and master throughout the game\u00a0</li><li>Unique enemies with custom battle strategies when encountered\u00a0</li><li>A compelling narrative based on the Ovid's interpretation of the Medusa myth</li><li>Branching narrative based on your decisions in battle and in the overworld.\u00a0</li><li>Short gameplay of around 3-6 hours.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nCharacters\r\n<ul><li><strong>\u201cThe Gloryhound\u201d</strong> - A fool by any other name is still the same .<br/> Born somewhere though they often change where\u00a0and raised on myth and fantasy, the Gloryhound seeks to find their fortune, not in doing good works, but in doing Glorious Projects. Hostile to criticism, the Gloryhound is a braggart, but good for little else.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>\u201cThe Barbarian\u201d</strong> - A true son of the land of Libya. <br/>He claims to be some form of noble, a descendant of an honorable house of Berbers. Or is he a champion from Mali? Or was he a son of Apollo? Either way he's quite the talker and quite the fighter. He can be found in the tavern, imbibing spirits and telling tales of his life.\u00a0\u00a0</li><li><strong>\u201cThe Heathen\u201d</strong> - Some type of wicked Magos.\u00a0<br/>She prays to no gods and serves no master. Truly a <strong>savage.</strong> Her powers come from nature and she is able to commune with the spirits, much better than she can with humans or maybe it's just the Gloryhound. She is rarely found in the city. You'd have better luck finding her in the woods with the other beasts.\u00a0</li><li><strong>\u201cThe Shrew\u201d</strong> - A kindly young woman who for whatever reason chooses to wear a veil.\u00a0 Maybe she's a leper. Or like so beautiful she'd bewitch Zeus.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe there's a beard under there. No one knows. She's a lady of real mystery for sure.\u00a0She\u2019s able to do something called \u201cmedicine\u201d but it is more likely she is blessed by Hermes. Whatever the case, she\u2019s a life saver.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Grey</strong> - A kind old hermit who has taken a liking to the Gloryhound.<br/> He\u2019s great at giving wisdom, though it always seems to be someone else's fault if things go wrong. He\u2019s also great at finding problems for you to solve. Like unnaturally talented at finding things for you to do.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T06:33:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d781b25e3ca5c509bb78b393e30a727e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AGGroAzteca"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
