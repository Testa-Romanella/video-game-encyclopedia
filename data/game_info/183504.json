I modeled the mechanics that I scripted after the mechanics in Nintendo's Metroid Prime series, with some variations such as an area-of-effect for the missiles. When charging the charge gun, it will draw in ammo pickups for your gun or missiles, as well as health pickups. The turrets and moving enemies were built from scripts I made in an earlier project.</p>\n<p>Note: The mouse controls in the WebGL player can be kind of wonky, but they work fine in the executable file. Press the lock cursor button to lock the cursor to the center of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>All sounds are from FreeSound.org.</strong></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Space - Jump<br/></p>\n<p>1 - Equip charge gun</p>\n<p>2 - Equip missile</p>\n<p>Left Click - Click to fire weapon, or hold to charge the charge gun</p>\n<p>Mouse - Look around</p>\n\n<p>Year of production: Fall 2015<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daf/daff5ec96057ba46020141801dbbfdfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["S.
