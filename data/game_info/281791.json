Choose your table color and deck style as you prepare for a friendly battle. You can even use a picture from your photo album as the card back.  In addition, pit your efforts against the world and try to earn achievements in Game Center.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 26 random cards. Tap your deck to put your top card into the center arena. The opponent will place its top card into the arena for a battle. The player with the higher card keeps both. If both battle cards have the same rank, it's war! You and your opponent each place 3 cards (or less if there aren't enough cards) in the arena. The next card determines who takes all of the cards in the arena! The game ends when one player wins all of the cards. <br/><br/>Please check out my other apps:<br/><br/>Circus Math<br/>Math Fish Tank<br/>Santa Math<br/>Math Cowboys<br/>Math Haunted House", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:56:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b34/b3474fba30270bd9d68b2beea9aa813b.jpg", "website": "http://www.lfeldman.com/card-battles", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Larry Feldman"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Larry Feldman"], "esrb_rating": null}
