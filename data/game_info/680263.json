If you imagine this \"developer\" were you, then by different actions you will be \"filtered\" into those who end up managing work and life good and those that does not, by showing outcomes of your virtual \"developer\". Your actions when facing situations like facing overtime is vital for your \"developer\" character.</p>\n<p>This filter tries to tackle the issue of \"work-life balance\" of programmers. From what I have heard of, in some companies in China (and perhaps some companies in the US as well) there are forms of excessive labor required for programmers, requiring them to stick to a \"996\" (9am-9pm per week, 6 days per week), and often, work-life balance is not respected in China due to stronger emphasis on \"collectivism\". Though the issue is now on the way to be resolved through legal actions, I still want to use this is to call for recognition of the importance of work-life balance. Also when you face a manager that is toxic, it is not your fault if you walk away from them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T03:54:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faa11801debdfa9e7cb6dee3fa5cdb5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CircleCly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
