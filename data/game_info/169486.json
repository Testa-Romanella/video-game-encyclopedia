So, here we are!<br/></p>\n<p>Glowi Games ''proudly''\u00a0presents\u00a0<strong>Inperito();</strong></p>\n<p>There are some known bugs (such as sticking to the side of a wall), some missing elements here and there (we would've preferred a more extensive main menu and events for the dialogue) and we didn't have the time to implement the soundtrack (songs made by ourselves).\u00a0 We would still like you to point things out to us, since we are planning on continuing development for the game. The soundtrack/effects is still available for download.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for sticking around, we hope you enjoy the (concept) of the game as much as we enjoyed making it! :)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programmer - Dani Christiaans<br/>Music\u00a0&amp; Graphics Design - Maxwell Muskita</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/272/2722012233e1119cf6dec1123918bc85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["GlowiGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
