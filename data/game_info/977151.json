Her newest assignment is as dangerous as it is important to the newly married ninja: If she succeeds, she can resign honorably and live together with her husband.<br/><br/>The target for her last mission is Amakusa Castle, home of a powerful general rumored to be involved in slave trade. Tasked to uncover the truth, Ayame acts as a mercenary for hire to gain Lord Amakusa\u2019s trust. Forced to follow his crude orders to remain undercover, her mission quickly turns into a test of willpower. Will Ayame be able to keep her senses and return to her husband after the mission is over, or will she succumb under the general\u2019s advances becoming his next concubine?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Experience Ayame\u2019s story across three chapters in the style of a visual novel, with turn-based battle sequences deciding the outcome of her mission. Every combat is a test of Ayame\u2019s willpower, requiring her to resist or allow her opponent\u2019s sexual techniques.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Skippable prologue<br/></li><li>Turn-based combat with sex-battle techniques<br/></li><li>Multiple endings<br/></li><li>Reminiscence room</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-19T05:56:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b23/b230f6da06253b0d2649eb9ed1c49599.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OneCoin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Saikey Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
