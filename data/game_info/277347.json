Players are given assault rifles this time around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shooting the rifle will induce screen shaking, screen flashing, and some rather loud audio.</p>\n<p>Player 1 controls the blueish green crosshair and has the darker colored birds as their primary targets.</p>\n<p>Player 2 controls the red crosshair and has the lighter colored birds as their primary targets.<br/></p>\n<p>Shoot your intended targets as they fly by in order to earn points! Be careful, you are able to shoot your enemy's targets as well, causing you to lose some points!</p>\n<p>Violent Bird Hunt was made with the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons in mind.
