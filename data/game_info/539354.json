Can you find out what\u00a0Dr. Jones knows before then?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>4 Days To Extraction</em> is set over five days, April 1st to April 5th 1957 and takes place in Chicago.<br/></p>\n<p>I've always found the use of newspapers and cyphers one of the most fascinating parts of Cold War espionage.\u00a0 As such, <em>The Chicago Daily Defender</em> features quite heavily. So do cyphers.</p>\n<p>Pen and paper (or digital equivalent) might come in handy. This is probably not an easy game.</p>\n<p>I put this together in quite a hurry (I only saw this Jam the day before the deadline), but I rushed it through because I want to get back into Twine this year. I might add some extra features after the Jam, and will correct any typos etc. Anyhow, hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p><em>Sources</em><br/>Daily Defender (Daily Edition) (1956-1960) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/historical-newspapers/photo-standalone-23-no-title/d...</p>\n<p><em>Assets<br/></em>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Special+Elite&amp;display=swap<br/>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aries.svg\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:51:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a8/4a87b732293be7418dce67c6cb9aec40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jtlloyd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
