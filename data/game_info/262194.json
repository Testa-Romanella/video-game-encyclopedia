Its purpose isn't to be a great game, that's unique and worth an audiences attention. Rather its purpose is to show the power of USharp, a plugin for UE4 that allows the developer to write code in c#. It's a very early prototype, with no ability to win or lose. I see it as a simple playground, functional at the least. <br/></p>\n<p>USharp currently requires .NET Framework to be installed on the users machine. This means no Mac or Linux builds will be available. You may encounter an error when you start the game. If this is the case, simply alt-tab out of the game, and stop it via task manager. <br/></p>\n<p>I used the start content pack (comes with ue4) and some assets from the Complete Unity course on Udemy (Older Version). Unity Course On Udemy<br/></p>\n<p>Feel Free To Try The USharp plugin for yourself if you are interested in using an easy to use scripting language in Unreal Engine 4.
