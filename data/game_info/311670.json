Each step, each puzzle, brings you closer to discovering the history and secrets of a lost civilization. Can you find the light?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere The Light is a single-player, first-person puzzle exploration game. The game is split into 4 separate linear levels, each takes you deeper into the heart of the planet. I wanted to create an immersive world where story, visuals and music are merged together in interesting and creative ways. There The Light features 50 puzzles, and a soundtrack that grows and forms based on the interactions that you make in-game.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaf/aaf100ce542d0159c5041726a819ae4b.jpg", "website": "https://casualbebop.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 2, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CasualBebop"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CasualBebop"], "esrb_rating": null}
