It is, or at least tries to be, a bullet hell with only one bullet. Also there is no shooting involved, so the player does not even have a single bullet.</p>\n<p>Dodge the orb to the best of your abilities and save the people of Crabland from the tyranny of blue crab.</p>\n<p>Credits to Juhani Junkala for the amazing music. Credits to malekith97 for the crab image and Rawdanitsu for the planet image used at the end.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:34:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/618448313dec9ab61836685ed36db0cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xerca"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
