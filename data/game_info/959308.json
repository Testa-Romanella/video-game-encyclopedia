It is highly embarrassing for me and I fear the worst - That is, mutiny. How can my crew revere me when I am so underdressed? When my beautiful bonce is nude? No, this will certainly not do, says I! This must be resolved. You will be pleased to learn that a temporary hat has taken seat upon my bothersome brow - it is a small hat, mayhaps beneath me, but it keeps the shivers (and the timbers) at bay until other arrangements can be made.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I set my trusty first mate, Sealegs, the task of hunting down my handsome hat, some days ago - It seems that this may not be as easy as I once thought, as my tricornered trophy has not yet been handed back as I would have hoped; It seems reinforcements are needed. Everyone is at odds, and this hat is just one more thing for us to endure - O my sweet log, I have prayed at the altar (That is, my dressing table) that They who smile down upon all Pirate-kind smiles down favourably upon me - a humble, yet dastardly duck, and answers my prayers - That I will wake up, and my hat will be there, returned by some honourable hero who should come floating my way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wouldn't that be divine? I am such a good Cap'n, you see - I deserve a good thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Knowing that it is time once more to return to my crew, I must bring about the end of this log; I leave you on a spirited note, for we shall have fresh crab for tea - Huzzah! A hearty meal is certainly something we all look forward to, being something sure to invigorate us as we all tally forward. There is much to do, always, but with\u00a0song in our hearts and\u00a0crab in our bellies, it's not so bad. The quality of the song? Variable. But Cook has never let me down.</p>\n<p>Back to the boat, then. What's that strange, flapping sound?
