But the more walls you place the harder it is to rotate them to accurately place them!</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>There is a how to play page in the main menu but we'll say it here anyway.</p>\n<p>Place walls to stop the fire\u00a0<br/>from reaching the target.</p>\n<p>Click to place a wall - there is a cooldown\u00a0<br/>between each placement.<br/>Rotate the wall with A and D.<br/>Change the size of the wall with W and S.<br/>Placing a wall over another will bounce push the wall slightly away.<br/>You can only place walls near the fire and cannot place them close to the target.<br/>Survive until the timer runs out.</p>\n<p>There are pre placed walls at the start to help.</p>\n<p>GOOD LUCK!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Vijithan Jeyakody - Programmer, some textures</p>\n<p>Danial Kamran - Most textures, audio, UI</p>\n<p>Audio clips from zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:09:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55d/55d987cc9201bc5246c0962633e5a467.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Developing Viji"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
