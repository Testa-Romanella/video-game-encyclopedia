One of the last way of \r\nobtaining power, is gathering static energy, from fur of extremly fluffy\r\n descendants of guinea pigs - the \u201cFluffs\u201d.\r\nHowever\u2026 you are just a simple worker at the old \u201cFluff Factory\u201d.

Game has unfortunately no sfx and no music. There was just \r\nno time for it. I have managed to create 5 different quality settings, \r\nso you should be able to play this even on older machines. Game might be\r\n slightly unballanced as there was no real time for testing. Watch the \r\ngameplay video if you have trouble understanding the game. </p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Buying 3-4 Fluffs should be enough</li><li>Fluffs regain energy in the enclosure, but only if there is food and water</li><li>More Fluffs in enclosure -&gt; food and water are drained more rapidly</li><li>You can throw away empty boxes and Fluff Poop into garbage can</li><li>There are a lot of usefull items hidden in the factory</li><li>You can improve maximum energy of a Fluff, by putting it into training wheel.</li></ul>\n<p>Gameplay:<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Timelapse - Making of :</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ad/0ad4ef22b71e910c4ab439c142780617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simple Ghost"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
