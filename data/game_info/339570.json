You can take water from the well and store it in the barrel. Blue indicators show you irrigation of flowers. Job is done when flowers grow up. Move with \"WSAD\" or arrows, fill the barrel with \"Space\" and change temperature scale with \"T\". Speaking of temperature, when it's too high the\u00a0well isn't working so store water wisely!</p><p>This is more like a one level prototype than \"real game\", but check it out!</p>\n<p>(Only for Mac and Windows 64bit)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T03:42:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c61298e878051926da376b0555667b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["karteczqa"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
