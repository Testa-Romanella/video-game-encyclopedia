It's a stealth game in which you have to escape from the dungeon and make your way to the castle exit</em></p>\n<p>You are a rebel locked in a cell in a filthy dungeon. But some friend of yours has bribed one of the guards to help you escape, although you'll have to do all the tough job.</p>\n<p>You choose your moves, you can crouch, walk run and sprint. But be careful, the faster you move, the more noise you'll do, and you'll be easier to catch. There are dozens of guards so beware. Try to find a weapon and get rid of those annoying guards or hide in the shadows. And be careful wuth the traps, too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96f/96f0c0f7f6c2d6dee3fd1c4c909deb4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Draiikz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
