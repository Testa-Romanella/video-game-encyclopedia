HOW IS THIS GAME RELEVANT TO THE THEME? (RENEWAL)</strong></p>\n<p>I decided to go for the more literal take which is to <em>extend the period of validity of a license, subscription or contract</em>.\u00a0That's how I ended up choosing\u00a0<strong>passport </strong><strong>renewal</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. WHAT SORT OF EXPERIENCE/MESSAGE ARE YOU HOPING YOUR GAME WILL BRING ACROSS TO THE PLAYER?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I wanted\u00a0to reimagine the frustrating experience that renewing the passport has brought forward to Singaporeans in the past year... but shown in a more light-hearted angle.</p>\n<p>Play as Pappy the Passport as they <em>siam\u00a0</em>through obstacles just to get renewed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. WHY DID YOU END UP CHOOSING THE DIRECTION OF YOUR GAME?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ever since travel restrictions got eased up, I have seen stories online, and have heard from friends about their renewal experience and I just found it hilarious and so Singaporean that how everybody knows how soul-sucking it's gonna be to try and expedite their passports but do it anyway because y'know,<em> travel restrictions are eased</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PLAYER CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD or arrow keys to move</li><li>Left mouse or spacebar to progress the game/click on stuff</li><li>Don't worry about dying/fainting/unaliving!
