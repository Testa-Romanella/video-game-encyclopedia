Would you prefer to build an impenetrable self-restoring defense? Would you set up some long-spanning plans to destroy the Opponent's base with your loyal soldiers? Up to you to decide!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOutsmart thy Opponent\nThe towers you pick before the battle are kept secret until built on the field.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns are done simultaneously, so every turn brings an opportunity to force your Opponent to guess what kind of tower you will build this time.\n<br/>\nThis allows for plenty of unpleasant surprises and sudden ambushes. Is this work under construction a vicious attack or a bluff? Should I expect a risky move from my Opponent or assume he's as afraid of me as I am of him?
