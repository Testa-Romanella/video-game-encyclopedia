China is in turmoil.<br />\nThe Han Dynasty crumbles before the child-emperor. He is but a figurehead; a mere puppet for the tyrant warlord Dong Zhuo. It is a brutal and oppressive regime, and as Dong Zhuo\u2019s power grows, the empire slips further into the cauldron of anarchy.<br />\nBut hope yet blossoms.<br />\nThree heroes, sworn to brotherhood in the face of tyranny, rally support for the trials ahead. Scenting opportunity, warlords from China\u2019s great families follow suit, forming a fragile coalition in a bid to challenge Dong Zhuo\u2019s remorseless rule. Will they triumph against the tyrant, or will personal ambition shatter their already crumbling alliance and drive them to supremacy?<br />\nThe crucible fizzes. Allegiances shift. The fires of conflict stoke opportunity. Only one thing is certain: the very future of China will be shaped by its champions.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2019-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T16:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b4c/b4cd6c7a2712b88eec149536882d6c3b.jpg", "website": "http://www.feralinteractive.com/en/mac-games/threekingdomstw/?utm_source=mas&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=mas_threekingdomstw_minisite", "rating": 3.95, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 59, "owned": 534, "beaten": 50, "toplay": 127, "dropped": 71, "playing": 38}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 198, "ratings_count": 156, "suggestions_count": 294, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 158, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "Creative Assembly"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Feral Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
