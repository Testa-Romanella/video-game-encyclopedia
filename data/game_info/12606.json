It\u2019s a first-person survival horror game, a part of the Resident Evil franchise. The Beginning Hour follows a standalone story indirectly connected to the main game.</p>\n<p>You take on the role of an unnamed man that wakes up in an abandoned house. During the exploration you find a tape and see a film crew that was attacked here by someone. You need to follow their way around the house to reveal the truth about its owners. The plot has four endings depending on your actions during the second part of the game.</p>\n<p>Both the main game and its demo version are focused on atmosphere rather than on fights. You have almost no weapons and have to act stealthily. As the Beginning Hour is strictly time-limited it doesn\u2019t feature many monsters or action scenes; the gameplay is based on exploration. The most frightening aspect of the game is its suspenseful atmosphere and the lack of knowledge about the house and its hosts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-01T16:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/1190d9632988dbe1c6d3001ee51c4c74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.79, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 47, "owned": 1802, "beaten": 250, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 38, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 321, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 321, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
