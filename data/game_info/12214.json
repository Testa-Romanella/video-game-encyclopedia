In your journey you will face many perils, but will you make it out of this strange planet alive? </strong><br/><br/>Spacecorn was made by three portuguese students (we like to call ourselves Gentlemen in Tuxedos, picture it as company name) on summer break. <br/>This is the first chapter, of a series that will be coming soon(at least that's the plan).<br/><br/>We hope you enjoy our little adventure through the world of programming and video games. That said, we plead that you don't take it seriously from a gameplay perspective, enjoy the ride!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T12:48:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb528c878ce7e158333dbab32666300e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 110}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rafael Lima", "Nuno Guerreiro", "Henrique Pegacha"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gentlemen in Tuxedos"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
