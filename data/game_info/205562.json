Here are his mood board and his background.<br/><br/>I didn't not enjoy working with Nick's mood board. It was very vague, only really giving me direction towards using earth tones. The picture of a water park was confusing as it was used to show the mountains in the distance, not the actual water park. I would have liked to use his background but the art was not pleasing to look at. The trees in particular need a lot of work. I tried to use a similar background but a major bug with the camera prevented me from doing that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["karmaturtle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
