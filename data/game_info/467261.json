You must manage the crumbling station's controls to survive the hostile aliens that will kill anything in their path.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>(Must be played with a keyboard)</p>\n<p>Press 1 to see the full controls!</p>\n<p>Rooms are shaped like a QWERTY keyboard. You can open or close their doors by pressing their corresponding key. Careful, the more doors you are using, the higher is the chance that one will break.\u00a0Rooms with broken doors will continuously blink red.</p>\n<p>Cameras can randomly break! Rooms with broken cameras\u00a0will be shown\u00a0as pitch black, no matter what might be lurking inside.</p>\n<p>Aside from the doors, you must also manipulate the ship's systems if you want to stay alive! You can only use one at a time, so make sure to turn them off after they've served their purpose.\u00a0The systems are each assigned to a number on the keyboard, they are:</p>\n<p>1 - Flashlight: Shows full controls.</p>\n<p>2 - IF bait: Turns on an infrared light that will lure the red aliens your way and make the violet aliens flee from you. Can only be used once before it needs to be fixed.</p>\n<p>3 - UV bait: Turns on an ultraviolet light that will lure the violet aliens your way and make the red aliens flee from you. Can only be used once before it needs to be fixed.</p>\n<p>4 - Fix door: Randomly fixes broken doors inside the station. Turns off your ability to interact with doors while it's turned on. Takes a few seconds to start up.</p>\n<p>5 - Fix camera: Ramdomly fixes broken cameras inside the station. Takes a few seconds to start up.</p>\n<p>6 - Fix bait: Fixes your baits so you can use them again. Takes a few seconds to start up.</p>\n<p>The two kinds of alien are hostile to each other. Use all of your resources to trick them into fighting among themselves so you don't get overwhelmed.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming: Gustavo Morais (<em>https://twitter.com/moraguma)</em></p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0 Daniel Amorim (<em>https://twitter.com/AmoraHere)</em></p>\n<p>Music: The Playwrights\u00a0(https://twitter.com/playwrightsband\u00a0/\u00a0\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/the_playwrights)</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: Alexei Morais (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vN3OHhVzypuYjYNUHuOKQ)</p>\n\n<p>This is our first jam so feedback is really appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:49:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94a/94ad4b212e8bccc9daaf181c362c977c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Guambe"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
