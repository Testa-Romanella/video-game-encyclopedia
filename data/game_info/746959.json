The upgrade is state of the art, and allows the recipient to process data more efficiently than even the fastest supercomputer! CyberCorp wants to evaluate ZX-87 through their numerous Robot Time Trials. The trials are filled with puzzles and obstacles, designed to test the robot's processing power.
