Her parents are getting older so she'd decided to take over her family's business: a root beer bar. Brew drinks and prepare food comprised of root vegetables to satisfy all 23 customers. The quicker they are served, the higher tip you'll receive.</p>\n<p>--How to Play--</p>\n<p>Left click to move/interact.</p>\n<p>Pick up vegetables from the vegetable sack and either bring them to the cutting board to prepare a meal, or create juice from them at a juicing machine.</p>\n<p>Bring juice to the carbonation machine to create root beer. You can either serve the root beer to the customer, or store it in a keg to dispense later. Collect money from customers once they leave.</p>\n<p>Press escape to pause.</p>\n<p>Hint - You'll have 1 minute of prep time before customers begin coming in, so it'd be a good idea to brew some batches of root beer before the bar opens.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T19:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c1/6c10ff2e8d123919679e2895cd3454fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JPiggs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
