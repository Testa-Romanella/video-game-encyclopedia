It's a pottery game where you play a lonely potter who has to sell pots each day to survive.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong>\r\nThe theme for this Ludum Dare was \"Your life is currency\".\u00a0 The game is loosely based around that theme, although we had the idea prior to the game jam and adapted it to fit.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong>\r\nEverything is controlled with the mouse.\u00a0Point, click and hold the mouse down to move the potter around. Move between the various work stations to create your pottery. Start by selecting an order, then picking up a block of material, move to the potter's wheel to sculpt it, paint it and finally, bake it in the kiln before depositing it on one of the pedestals for review and payment.</p>\n<strong>JAMES</strong><strong>EDGE</strong><strong>ADAM</strong>Art, Design\u00a0\r\n&amp; AnimationGameplay,\u00a0\r\nSound &amp; MusicArt, Design\u00a0\r\n&amp; HUD", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:39:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec1/ec126cede99e9f51a3180ec331308ce2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
