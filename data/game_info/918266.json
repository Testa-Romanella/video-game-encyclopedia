Its visual style is primarily inspired by that of Sonic 3/Sonic and Knuckles.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move Sonic around, and use the space bar to jump. \u00a0While moving, press the down arrow or S key to make Sonic spin (curl into a ball), making him immune to most obstacles and enemies, with a few exceptions.</p>\n<p>Repeatedly press space while pressing and holding down or S to make Sonic spin dash. Like in any other Sonic game, rings serve as not only collectibles, but also as a unique health system; if you take damage with at least 1 ring on hand, you lose all of your rings (as opposed to dying and losing a life right away, but there are a few exceptions, mainly drowning (yes, you can drown in Sonic games) and getting crushed) and they get launched in a circular pattern, allowing you to recollect those lost rings. You clear the level once you pass the signpost with Eggman's face on it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T08:51:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/036/036cd64d2330fa1e3c6b5639a9ec3032.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SMB_Fan2010"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
