Fancy golfing on\u00a0Mars? I got you. How about floating in the clouds, soaking in the breeze alongside traditional Japanese pagodas and an army of cherry blossoms? I go... actually that one's still in progress, but I assume you're picking up what I'm throwing down here.</p>\n<p>Hoping to kickstart my gamedev portfolio with the skills and experience this project has and is providing me on a daily basis. Thanks for checking\u00a0me the page out.</p>\n<p>Full Disclosure: The WebGL port is currently, with the greatest understatement in the world, rough around the edges; chances are it'll crash eventually if you're generating a lot of holes. However, it should give a decent idea and demonstration of how the game plays out before then. I'll be working to try and stabilise the build in the near future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40f2fb30f7e4164f863fee94a5a84fd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DLynch"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
