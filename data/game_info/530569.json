However, this wasn\u2019t enough. We always want what we do not have; humans, by their very nature, are always seeking to expand their boundaries. People began to wonder, for instance, what is hidden beneath the waves: buried treasure or killer sea monsters? Everyone had been hearing that the earth was round, but there wasn\u2019t any proof. Magellan went on a voyage across the world and changed that forever. You can change the world too. Commander, lead your troops onto the high seas.
