They will be here in about a minute to gently fondle your plane and probably eat your brain afterwards. <br/></p>\n<p>I hope for your own sake that you know how to start a plane, cause I ain't tellin' ya'. Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>So I have been playing some flightgear lately and was in the mood to make a flight sim. <br/>Bested my kryptonite the evil Quaternion I was set on a path to glory. <br/>Did you know aerodynamic surfaces are hard to model. Yeah turns out simulators are hard to make for a reason. <br/>Luckily I only make you start the plane. Try to reach the win trigger in the air, its more luck than skill. Enjoy the<strong> broken physics</strong>! No time to fix them now, I will fix them after the jam or not. Depends on my level of procrastination. Also the Credits don't roll *sigh*, but you only miss out on a few cheesy jokes...<br/></p>\n<p>Also I had a minor hart attack, when the WebGl version didn't work. Turns out there is a bug in the new Systeminput, that doesn't return the current mouse. Quick rewrite was needed.</p>\n<p>If your stuck completetly here are a few tips:</p>\n<ul><li> rightclick and drag to turn the camera</li><li>use scroll to zoom in and out</li><li>left click and drag control surfaces</li></ul>\n<p>Tool Used:</p>\n<ul><li>Engine: Unity</li><li>3D Editor: Blender 2.83</li><li>2D Editor: GIMP</li><li>Music: Fruity Loops</li><li>Audio Editor: Audacity</li><li>Human model: MakeHuman</li><li>Satellite data: Google.com, NASA STRM hightmap</li></ul>\n<p>Textures:</p>\n<ul><li>https://www.poliigon.com/texture/ground-forest-003</li><li>https://www.poliigon.com/texture/ground-clay-002</li><li>https://www.poliigon.com/texture/road-city-worn-001</li><li>RoadDesert002 (removed from poliigon.com)</li><li>buk3.png https://scenery.flightgear.org/app.php?c=Models&amp;a=view&amp;id=2394</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T05:28:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43e/43ea24e0f16f98bbccc4ec15a30e75f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Voidsay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
