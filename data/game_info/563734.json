Yes, I might have to come back and fiddle with some things, but committing and publishing is the furthest step I have ever taken in any project. Even after all the playtesting, I feel much better just pressing publish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is meant to be part of a larger string of projects where I fiddle with different systems until I get them how I like them. Then, I can shove them together in a larger game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will link a full play through after a time, so I can make changes if need be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That Guy That Does Things will likely be playing my game and is a generally fun guy to watch.
