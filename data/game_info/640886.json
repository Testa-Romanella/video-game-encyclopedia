Jack\u00a0tags along Casie for adventure and because he\u00a0has got nothing better to do.</p>\n<p>Original\u00a0game design by @shoutscion. You can find the Kickstarter version of Jack and Casie\u00a0here.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>This PICO-8 game is mouse controlled.</p>\n<p>During an encounter, Casie will occasionally\u00a0reach for the inventory (once the progress bar is full)\u00a0and pick the first item. It is marked \"NEXT\" in the game. If the item is a weapon she will try to use it. If it is a food item, she will consume it for health. Each new type of food item she consumes, she will be rewarded with +1 max HP as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>Jack will pick up items from the ground during the adventure\u00a0and provide it on the conveyor belt feed. You can pick items with the left mouse button and place them in the inventory at the bottom of the screen with the left mouse button again.<br/></p>\n<p>While the item is\u00a0picked up, and you can't place the item, try spinning it with the right mouse button.</p>\n<p>You may combine items together, e.g. ammunition can be combined with weapons to reload them. Food items can be placed on the pan, which then can be placed on a charged-up stove to cook.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T06:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daa/daa13a10bc72e0d6e167079e200b69ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spoike"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
