The theme of the jam was \"Lost In Space.\" To go with the theme, the Player is lost in enemy territory, with no allies to be found. The Player must shoot down the opposing ships, using a smooth 3D flight system to accomplish the task. There is always a brief 60 second period of peace between the waves. That is the time where one should destroy blue marked asteroids; as it will drop gems capable of repairing the Player's ship\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other Team Members:\u00a0\r\n<br/>https://nerfherder.itch.io/\u00a0--\u00a0 Developer<br/>https://ephoolio.itch.io/ -- 3D Modeler<br/>https://imperial-scorer.itch.io/\u00a0-- Composer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T01:46:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95d3fb2556fefbb61165f4c78c4d5bb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lukefrisbee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
