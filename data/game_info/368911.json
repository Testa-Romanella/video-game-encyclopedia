You need to feed them to keep them alive and\u00a0you can also pet and give them treats to level them up.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Up = Up-Arrow</li><li>Down = Down-Arrow</li><li>Right = Right-Arrow</li><li>Left = Left-Arrow</li><li>A = Z</li><li>B = X</li><li>Start = Enter</li><li>Select = Shift</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>You can control the cursor using up/down/right and left. You can pick up pets by pressing A when hovering over the pets in the side bar. You'll also be able to see their stats in the info tab if you are hovering over them. When you have picked up a pet you can place it on the map\u00a0by pressing A or unselect it by pressing B.</p>\n<p>The pets will automatically attack when enemies are in range. But you'll have to feed them after each turn, if you don't<em> they'll die.</em> You can do this by picking up food and pressing A on your pets. Do the same with treats and you'll make your pets very happy.\u00a0You can also pet your pets by having nothing selected and pressing A on your pets.
