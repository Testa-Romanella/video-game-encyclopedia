All law enforcement, armies and even the superheroes haven't been able to stop it. With no option left the president contacts the worlds most dangerous Supervillain, Dr Doomstar, a brilliant engineer known for building the most planet crushing doomsday weapons.  If she can defeat the foe then she will save the world and also gain her freedom.</p>\n<p>Firing the weapon has recoil so massive it will blow you out of the stage. Set up forcefields at the edge of the stage before firing to keep from being blown to kingdom come.</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n  </p>\n<p>WASD / LTS - Move/Aim\r\n    </p>\n<p>LMB /RT - Fire (Hold to charge and fire)\r\n    </p>\n<p>SPACE/ A - Jump (up to 3 times)\r\n    </p>\n<p>Shift/ X - Sprint\r\n    </p>\n<p>Q/ LB - Switch Weapon\r\n</p>\n<p>Hey everyone and welcome to my VimJam 2 entry for Boss / On the Edge. This is a challenging fast paced shooter with probably your enemies doing more of the shooting than you.</p>\n<p>There was so much I had to skip due to over scoping as usual, including a mechanic where the Lackeybot could show up and catch you from being blown out of the edge. Hopefully its still fun and enjoyable. Just be ready with those weapon switches when Lackeybot advises them.</p>\n<p>As always, thanks for checking it out.<br/></p>\n<p>Game designed in Unity by Circumpunk-KKB <br/></p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p>Available from Unity Asset Store<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Playmaker by Hutong Games</li><li>Corgi Engine by More Mountains</li><li>Stalagmite Golem by Fluzo Studios</li><li>Flat kit: Toon shading by Dusty Room</li><li>Sherbbs Particle Collection by Sherbb</li><li>Trails FX by Kronnect</li><li>Hologram Effect Shader by Peter Lu</li><li>Sanctuary by Purple Jump</li><li>Sword and shield animation by Cut7man</li><li>Animations Unleashed by Solidtary Forge</li><li>X-Weapon Trail by shallway</li><li>City Voxel Pack by Poeme</li><li>Skybox Volume 2 (Nebula) by Hedgehog Team</li><li>Pro Sound Collection by Gamemaster Audio</li><li>Scream sound from Horror FPS Kit by Thunderwire Studio</li></ul>\n<p>Music Available from Soundcloud under CC0 &amp; Creative Commons Attribution<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The Dark Queen [Drum &amp; Bass] by Nome </li><li>Scary Atmosphere \"Danger Around the Corner\" by Darren Curtis</li><li>Danger by Prashan</li></ul>\n\n<p>Other models Available from Sketchfab available under Creative Commons Attribution</p>\n\n<ul><li>WaifuMkIV by chadmanning1989 (rigged in Mixamo)\r\n</li><li>VR Goggles by blazej.mikula\r\n</li><li>Smol Robo by fbeauregard\r\n</li><li>Sci-Fi Gun by Nathan\r\n</li><li>Sci-Fi Blade by KBLevasseur577\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfc/cfc2e38509b3a89f55a3390fc1ee4e6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Circumpunk"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
