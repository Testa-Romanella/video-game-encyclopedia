A thrawn, midnight creature whose charcoal ribs burst from the Sleir's peak. Through whispered clouds you can see its spindle bones skulking down the mountain's sides, scoring wounds in its flank. No flesh has ever covered these bones, no blood ever flowed through its veins. It waits, hungry.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>You grew up in the flats, your childhood was spent in its shadow. For as long as you can remember workers from the villages have gone up the mountain, to make their contribution to the skeleton. Now, it is your turn.</em></p>\n<p><em>You have been given a message to deliver to the mountaintop. Climb the mountain and discover its features - lakes as clear as crystal,\u00a0 abandoned buildings, abundant animals, strange artefacts. Your message will change the fate of the mountain, will you deliver it?</em></p>\n<p>///</p>\n<p>The Skeleton is currently being necromanced, feed its hungering maw with your coinage.
