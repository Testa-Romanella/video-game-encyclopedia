Heavy projectile with long range and much damage.</p><p>It's so slippery the projectiles are lightning fast with a huge range.</p><p>A piece of wood carved into a rifle. Massive firerate but just small damage for each wooden bullet.</p><p>As close as you can get to a shotgun in an icethemed game. Shoots three bullets at once each with good damage. Just a short range.</p><p>Slow fire rate and slow projectile speed. Projectile doesn't do any damage.
