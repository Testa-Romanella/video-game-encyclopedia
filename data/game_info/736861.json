Solve puzzles, note down important clues and carry out exciting dialogs with abstruse characters. LE is the first \"real\" game I ever made, which is why it is still very bugy. I stopped Development around the start of 2020, because i just got bored. Also only in german because 15-year old Raphi was too insecure to make an english game... sorry :/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f8839f6c14f5d113a73d90aafa98d01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raphiaffi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
