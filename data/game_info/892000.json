Overall I'm really pleased with how it turned out in terms of the shaders and map design. Combat is simple, and a little unbalanced once you figure out how it works. I am also aware of a couple of bugs, in particular one affecting the game actually finishing. At some point in the future I want to revisit it and polish/fix/update it maybe with new content?</p>\n<p>For now though what you see is what you get.</p>\n<p>The Plot</p>\n<p>You are an unnamed protagonist in Smalltown, Indiana. On your tenth birthday you are given the only animal left a hive full of bees! Use your pet bees to battle and educate the townsfolk and reverse the local farm's doomed fate!</p>\n<p>Also, the win condition is beating enough trainers because it's never said anywhere in the game. I'll try and fix that in the next update to clarify it. Anyway, hope you have fun and be sure to leave any bugs you find in the\u00a0comments so whenever I come back to this I can try and patch them! Or fun experiences you have, those work too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T08:26:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/926/926875cca499f29164cad229583f4c3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SometimesGames"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
