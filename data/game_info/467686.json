The catch is, the arena will toggle different settings on and off every so often; making the abilities you have, the weapons you have, the enemies you face and the arena you fight in all 'out of your control'. One minute you could be shooting your way through enemies using a shotgun, the next the controls have been reversed. With over 25 different toggles, Toggle Arena not only gets more difficult as the game goes on, but as you adapt to the new rules and circumstances the arena throws at you.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to Move</p>\n<p>Left\u00a0Shift to Sprint</p>\n<p>Left Click to Shoot</p>\n<p>Right Click to use a Special Ability</p>\n<p>Escape to Exit to the Main Menu</p>\n<p>R to Play Again after Dying</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74a7eef5a442b0e2f9f84256166a87e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mark Auman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
