Each enemy has a text above him which represents something that has to be related with a particular concept word given at the beginning of the level. If the word is related it means that the unit is an ally and you have to save him using rescue towers. Otherwise you have to kill him. The game is still under development and it contains 10 different towers which can be upgraded twice, 40 creatures, 3 unique regions, 15 playable maps, 39 passive skills called talents, 9 active skills called abilities, 40 experience levels and 12 achievements.
