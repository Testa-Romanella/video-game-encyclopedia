If people end up playing the game I will happily come back and patch a few things and even adding a few more things like maps, enemies and a story mode.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>A or left arrow key\u00a0= left</p><p>D or right arrow key\u00a0= right</p><p>S or down arrow key = invincible powerup (must be bought)</p><p>NOTE. you can only be either 1 invincible or ressurection powerup per each game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T13:04:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c29e92354d65b1ef29b736d3262deecc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Kilby"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
