It is based on the film of the same name.</h2>\n<p>The Genesis title is one of three video games created to tie into the release of Predator 2. Also produced were a Commodore game and a Master System game. Despite the fact all three were released under the title Predator 2, gameplay actually varies quite substantially across the three titles.</p>\n<p>The game is an isometric shooter where players shoot down enemies while rescuing hostages. At the same time, the player must avoid the Predator&#39;s attack as well as preventing the Predator from killing the hostages themselves. If enough hostages are killed the game will be over. There are various pickups. These range from health packs, various types of weaponry, or drugs that can increase the player&#39;s score.</p>\n<p>(Source of Description - Xenopedia; &#39;Predator 2 (1992 Genesis Game)&#39;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-07T07:59:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6c/f6cd707a83ef62f9272f9780c5526512.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 28, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SEGA Master System", "Genesis", "Game Gear"], "developers": ["Teeny Weeny Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Arena Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
