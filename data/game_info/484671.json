He decided to arrange an escape to be with her one last time, but at the last moment, a cellmate turned him in to shorten his sentence.<br/>\r\nThe prisoners could not sleep that night because of the screams that came from the police room. It is still unclear who exactly shouted, since not only Kerbalai, but also two officers disappeared after that night...<br/>\r\nThere is a legend that although the police managed to stop Kerbalai, but his soul is still looking for justice. Every night, he locks the rookie officers in their room so the prisoners can get out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOutside The Grid is a multiplayer game where you can play as a team of prisoners or as a team of police officers. At your disposal are many different tools with which you can open doors, stun opponents or pretend to be their friend.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd remember, Kerbalai is always there for you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T17:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb0c6d315ad8be0be577e6aba3790c32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GidAzGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GidAzGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
