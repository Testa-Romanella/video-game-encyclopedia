So you decide to go on a roadtrip with your childhood friends, to a lake where you spent your summers together in the past. But on the way there, you realize that a lot has changed since you were kids.</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Colorful, atmospheric handcrafted graphics</li><li>A highly detailed bus to explore</li><li>Soundtrack featuring various indie artists</li><li>An amount of dialogue we've never bothered to count</li><li>Will last you anywhere between 20 to 45 minutes</li><li>No objectives to fulfill, so take your time</li></ul>\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>Development started back in February of 2018 as part of our final thesis at university, where the two of us developed it for five months until we graduated in June.</p>\n<p>Since then, it has received pretty positive reactions, encouraging us to start development of an all new version of Northbound.</p>\n<p>This is not that new version. In fact, this version, now dubbed 'Long Road Ahead', is pretty much exactly the one we graduated with.</p>\n<p>We are uploading it here in order to clear our heads, re-process our development and design processes that led us to this version, and to gather feedback. We hope that all of this will help us with development of the new version of Northbound, so please let us know if you liked it.</p>\n<p>If you are interested, please follow us on Twitter for updates on the current state of development.</p>\n\r\nLinks\r\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/PlayNorthbound<br/>Website:\u00a0https://www.northbound-game.com<br/></p>\n\r\nDevelopers\r\n<p>Johannes K\u00f6berle:\u00a0https://twitter.com/KoeberleJ<br/>Arno Justus:\u00a0https://twitter.com/SuperBalrog</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T05:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d937e997ca159a27f163e0b641fc7e8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Super Balrog", "Northbound", "John Koeberle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
