Why not RPG Maker you ask? Because we're big ol' dumb dumbs and decided to reinvent the wheel. But, as far as re-invented wheels go, our's isn't so bad for 3 days of work.</p><p>In Word Warrior, you have a dictionary of about 225 nouns that you can transform into. Each word has a comedic result that gets displayed. The dictionary is taken primarily from the list of 2000 most common nouns, video game tropes, and some fun words.</p><p>Otherwise, it's a typical JRPG. You encounter random battles, and you can even level up. Wild!</p><p>Tips: </p><p>Try not to use proper nouns. Think of things.</p><p>Think of simple words like: \"Town, Teacher, School, Man, Woman, Car, Truck, Party, Wolf\"</p><p>There are some fun words too. Try typing in your star sign, the names of the planets, the days of the week, or the last names of certain politicians.</p><p>If you're stuck, here is the complete list of available words. Try it first without reading from the list.</p><p>Art and Overworld/Cutscene code by: Marcio Miranda</p><p>Battle system &amp; Menu code by: Jake Carewick</p><p>Music:</p><p>\"Cyborg Ninja\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p><p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>\"Overworld\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p><p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/93450a17b417138ae902db3694f2f97e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheBreakfast"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
