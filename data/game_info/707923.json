If you spawn them next to your castle (indicated with the usernames) they will cost the amount of gold shown on the card and fight for you.<br/>If you place them next to the enemies' castle, it will only cost you half the amount of gold and provide a nice gold boost once you kill the unit, but they will fight for your enemy and try to defeat you.\u00a0</p><p>There are also dirt pits on the map, where you can place towers in order to defend your kingdom.</p><p>Best of Luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:15:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/153/153b62275ac9a8fb89d049059a12d5cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rappbit"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
