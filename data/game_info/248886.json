It would be - there aren't any common letters! <br/><br/>But try Acewordy - the game where words are jumbled in a grid. Find the word, form it, look for the next. When you form a word, then its letters disappear and those above fall down to take the removed letters place.<br/><br/>Careful though, the grid is always moving upwards, and you don't want the top letters to go through the roof! <br/><br/>Horizontal, vertical, diagonal - the chain of letters could be hiding in any direction as long as successive letters remain adjacent to the previous. Look sharp, be wise. Rather, be Wordly Wise.<br/><br/>Check out the game's homepage on our website, for tips on improving your score.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:12:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09e/09ef35ad4da91966def5e182e15a568a_lymIteu.jpg", "website": "http://veplapps.com/ios-games/acewordy/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Vaibhav Electronics Pvt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Vaibhav Electronics Pvt"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
