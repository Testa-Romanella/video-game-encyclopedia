{"id": 942650, "slug": "hangman-for-twitch", "name": "Hangman for Twitch", "name_original": "Hangman for Twitch", "description": "<p>Hangman for Twitch is the classic children's word game transformed into a chat-interactive streaming game. Players type \"g\" followed by a guess to reveal letters in the hidden word. They accumulate points with correct guesses, and lose points when guessing the wrong letter. Guessing the correct word before it is reveal gives a special bonus. The game ends after 5 rounds, with the top players by score displayed. It also plays some nice fanfare.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created to experiment with the Twitch chat API, which ended up being fairly simple to implement. Honestly, the most challenging part was setting up a small webpage to handle catching the access token and displaying it to the user! The game is fairly simple but is nonetheless \"done\" - I don't have much to add to it. If you find bugs or would like to see a feature added, please comment!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T18:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6b/a6be6c7c9534234d96a867d3332bda1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cowboyscott"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
