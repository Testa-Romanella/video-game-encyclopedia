{"id": 509841, "slug": "agora-yangothemango22", "name": "Agora (YangoTheMango22)", "name_original": "Agora (YangoTheMango22)", "description": "<p>[Warning, spoilers for the game!]</p>\n\n<p>Agora, as it stands, is a DEMO version of a visual novel conceptualized by team Helix. Given the theme \"Backspace,\" we immediately thought of the actual key itself, and wanted to utilize that within the game. Therefore, our main character, known as \"Cryo\" or \"Cryogenic\" as her online game name, was created, a social recluse living exclusively in their room, only interacting with people online, an example being their closest friend \"Knight\" or \"KnightElden.\" The name of the game is also derived from her anti-socialness, Agora coming from Agoraphobia, fear of the outside world.\u00a0So, with an idea to use an actual keyboard inside the novel, and the idea of a social recluse, we decided \"Why not go for the classic 'get sucked in the game you're playing' approach?\" Also commonly known as the \"Jumanji theme.\" Once inside the game, it's hinted that Cryo's previous online persona was a spellcaster, which is again utilized as she uses a keyboard to type in key combos for certain attacks. At the end of the game, after a brush with death, Cryo hits the Backspace key and is sent backwards in time, where the DEMO ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:26:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1da/1dac1a02cee60df8a132184aa66a8436.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YangoTheMango22"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
