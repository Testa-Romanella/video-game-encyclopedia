Die Kathedrale is part of a text adventure trilogy; it is preceded by Das Stundenglas (1990) and succeeded by Hexuma (1992). The trilogy lacks an overarching plot, and in each entry the setting, role of the protagonist, and goal differ between each game. Games in the trilogy do not require knowledge of the other entries and may be played as standalone games.</p>\n<p>Die Kathedrale was inspired by St. Paul&#39;s Church in Munich, Germany.[1] In 1993, Die Kathedrale was adapted into a novel titled Die Kathedrale: Das Geheimnis einer Rache (English: The Cathedral: The Secret of Revenge), and was written by Die Kathedrale&#39;s writer Harald Evers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:47:36", "background_image": null, "website": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Kathedrale", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Software 2000"], "esrb_rating": null}
