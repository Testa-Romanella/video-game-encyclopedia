It is the spiritual successor of <em>Zillion 3D</em>, a Wolf3D mod<strong>.</strong> (You can check the original <em>Zillion 3D</em> here.)</p>\n<p>We have three new levels and other improvements. Now you can aim holding the right mouse button. Also, there\u2019s treasures like good old Wolfenstein 3D. We fixed (hopefully) a bug where enemies wouldn't shoot at you when you were crouching (thanks to\u00a0Caswyck!)</p>\n<p>If the game freezes after completing a level, please tell us! We need details! =]<br/></p>\n<p>All songs by Ozzed. You can find his amazing music at ozzed.net.</p>\n<p>This is beta version 0.4b. This demo contains 4 levels (around 10 minutes each level, 60 minutes overall).</p>\n<p>We\u2019d appreciate very much if you find a bug and report to us!!! =]</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong> core 2 duo onwards, probably...</p>\n<p><strong>Hitscan Heaven</strong> \u2013 Only ONE weapon. <em><strong>No bullet sponges</strong></em>. You have the most unfair gun in the galaxy - the Z Gun - which kills everything with ONE bullet.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Precision Shoot</strong> \u2013 Your laser hits EXACTLY where you aim. No recoil. No statistical bullshit. No mouselook dampening. You aim, you shoot, you destroy.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Tough but Fair Enemies</strong> \u2013Using both hitscan and projectile attacks. Each with its own behavior.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Destructible Scene Objects</strong> \u2013 Almost all objects are destructible, including NPCs. But beware! There\u2019s a penalty system to prevent killer sprees.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Level Design</strong> \u2013 No linear levels. No random generated levels. Good old level design with sprawling areas (the demo has only 4 levels so far).\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Arcade Style FPS</strong> \u2013 The ONLY items to collect are energy, ammo, keys, and treasures. No reload. No fatigue. No regenerating health. No crafting of any kind.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>RPG Style Story </strong>\u2013 Talk with NPCs. Search drawers, lockers, and other objects. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Penalty/Reward System</strong> \u2013 Gain points killing enemies, lose points killing NPCs and destroying scene objects. Die if your penalty score is too high.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Look Around Corners</strong> \u2013 You can look and shoot around corners by holding \u2018Q\u2019 then using \u2018W\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 to lean left or right.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Minor improvements and bug fixes:\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>Version 0.4b:</p>\n<p>- HUD overhaul.</p>\n<p>- Reticule now turns green when facing searchable objects.</p>\n<p>Version 0.4a:</p>\n<p>- Fixed a bug where enemies wouldn't shoot when crouching.
