The art style was inspired by the DJ players where the players switch between the left and right discs and improvise the music. Instead, here in our game, you gotta wake up your ears and follow the corresponding instruments in the music!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Operations:<br/>The palyers need to switch bewteen left and right tracks with left (&lt;-) and right(-&gt;) buttons, and hit the space button, and hold to last correct durations when each note passing the bottom green bar.<br/>There are two pieces of music in level 1 and 2. The players need to pass the score in level 1 to discover the level 2 music.<br/>Enjoy the funcky disco loops, and enjoy the challenge!\u00a0<br/>Welcome to leave your comments!</p>\n<p>Credits<br/>Program: Momo<br/>Arts: DarkF0_0<br/>Music: Cottonseed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b474e93a235f8cf81c118f626365a81a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DarkF0_0"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
