So you'll see the same teeny tiny faces pop up. But with a holidays flavour haha.</p>\n<p>The Z keyboard key words as the A\u00a0button for the Game Boy. Sometimes things will shake without pressing it though due to the dialogue button being the same one...whoops haha.<br/></p>\n<p>This was a nice refreshin' one after the longer project last time and the way longer multi-themed one before that.</p>\n<p>Might have more time to work on that other big multi-themed\u00a0game iv'e shown progress of a few times moooonths back. Had a lil astronaut space dude and a big computer screen with a face. Been a while since iv'e done anything with that so would be cool to start again haha.<br/></p>\n<p>Aaaand again; I'll add add music credits and a video here in the next few days hopefully.</p>\n<p>Aaaaanyway, cheers everyone for watchin' and playin' my stuff over the past couple years. Keen for another bunch of themes to make stuff for in 2022.</p>\n<p>Merry Christmas, Happy New Year aaaaand enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T09:31:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9da/9da61e3e32289809b16bbde4ca825837.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["GameBuoyGames - Michael Towns"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
