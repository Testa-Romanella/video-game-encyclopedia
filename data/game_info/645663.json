Here is another mini-game, this time featuring Pyra from Xenoblade Chronicles 2 in a swimsuit. Bring her soda and she'll chug it quickly, most of the time anyways. <br/></p>\n<p>UPDATE 1.1:<br/>- Sound effects have been added.<br/>- Pyra's swimsuit now breaks<br/>- Fixed a bug you probably didn't notice<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>R to restart<br/>Click and hold the left mouse button to grab the cola bottles on the left.<br/>Bottles that are falling can't be re-grabbed.<br/>Drag the bottle to Pyra's mouth to have her drink it.<br/>Left click Pyra's belly to bounce it and shake up the carbonation (helpful if you're here primarily for the burps).<br/>Hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse <em>across</em> Pyra's belly to rub it and settle the carbonation (and cause burping).<br/>If Pyra's belly is too shaken up, she'll burp instead of drinking the soda, knocking it away.<br/>There<em> is</em> a max size, though it may be difficult to notice when that point is reached.<br/></p>\n<p>Artwork by ExplodCode on DeviantArt, and used with permission.
