Took it a bit easier on this one, the game is a little bare bones with a focus on making my own art and sound effects whish I use to struggle with. This weekend has been me taking my microphone around my flat recording every sound I could make and curating them down to a short list of sufficiently creepy ones.</p>\n<p>Tormenting Idol takes the theme literally, a cursed Idol will chase you around a maze when the fog rolls in and will be frozen (sortof?) until the fog rolls back in again. this will happen every 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>- Dont get caught!</p>\n<p>- Retrieve the three keys around the level</p>\n<p>- Bring them back to the starting pedistals.</p>\n<p>- The Idols a little shy, looking at it will cause it to slow but not stop it!</p>\n<p>The idol will get more aggressive the closer you are to defeating them.</p>\n<p>- 1 key - increased movement speed, even when stunned</p>\n<p>- 2 keys - unlocks the ability to teleport, evem when the fog is thinner.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>- Mouse - look horizontally</p>\n<p>Tools Used:</p>\n<p>- Unity3d 2021.3.11f1</p>\n<p>- GIMP 2.10.20</p>\n<p>- Audacity 3.2.0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T08:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/352/35277e2cf33bb11a5315228bc3c614b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Camee14"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
