We're planning on adding a lot more to this as well as make it more optimized and work properly.</p>\n<p>WASD to move and spacebar for jump. The E key, X key, 1 key, and Left Click\u00a0fire the MouseWrath Laser.</p>\n<p>SPOILER (not really): There is no jump until shortly after the beginning of the game (it's an upgrade to get out of the mouse maze more\u00a0easily.)</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I've repackaged the game in Unreal Engine 5 Preview 2. This version is an otherwise completely unaltered version of the game jam release but in a newer version of Unreal 5. The game runs much better and doesn't crash, but now most of the time\u00a0my AI just stands still, major textures have gone missing,\u00a0ghosts of long deleted foliage show up randomly,\u00a0blob enemies go nuts,\u00a0and the static meshes sometimes are floating (among other newfound bugs),\u00a0so it's still not working incredibly\u00a0great, but now it's at least more playable. A new (hopefully smooth playing)\u00a0post-jam release planned soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T09:35:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86b/86b0842f6120823295f9431c8b76ce05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameJay2112"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
