A city journalist is trying to crack the case of a lifetime. During an investigation, you are able to find clues and more information about the mysterious entity.\u00a0<br/><br/>The demo has 3 endings.\u00a0<br/><br/>The project has been in development for a long time. Due to personal reasons, I was unable to finish the game. I thought leaving the game completely and deleting the current work would be unfair. I am sharing this so everyone can have a glimpse of what the game could have been. Your feedback and comments would be a huge help. Don't hesitate to share the playthroughs. I hope you enjoy the experience.\u00a0<br/><br/>Special Thanks To Adam Woodsmith - Leonvincible, who created the character of Primary Color Man.\u00a0<br/><br/>The controls are available during the gameplay.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T13:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e81/e81143c996fa6ca25ca75b11efb60e0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niven Hedinger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
