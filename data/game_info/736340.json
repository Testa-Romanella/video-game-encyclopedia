The main priority is tire deformation and suspension simulation for heavy vehicles.<br/></li><li>At this stage the game contains 18 vehicles and 3 maps.<br/></li><li>At the moment there are no missions in the game, just go to a garage, choose the vehicle that you like, drive it around and explore the 3 maps available.<br/></li><li>The approach taken to simulating vehicles was to start with simulating a tire using soft body physics in order to be able to deform similarly to how a real life tire would.</li></ul> <br/><ul><li>The tire is attached to a solid rim which is attached to a soild axle which is attached to the suspension (leaf springs) and the suspension is attached to the frame.<br/></li><li>On the frame there are other parts attached, truck cabin, drive shafts, dump box, hydraulic cilinder that lifts the dump box and mud flaps.<br/></li><li>The tires, the suspension, the frame use soft body physics and the rest of the parts rigid body physics.<br/></li><li>All the parts have their own mass, they interact with eachother and this is what determines the vehicle behavior.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T03:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ec8db191767d6bdfc991c38c610c6f4.jpg", "website": "https://www.mytruckgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chris"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Chris"], "esrb_rating": null}
