Didn't get around to balancing the sound.</p><p>Take control of the powerful, Construction Beetle. You must brawl the Pirate Beetle. Defeat it by maneuvering past its offenses or out ranging it with your long, incredible attacks. The right attack has a long start up but is very powerful, it might even score you a one hit KO!\u00a0The HP Bar does not determine if the game is over, it only determines how much knockback you take. The less HP, the more knockback!\u00a0The victor is determined by who is knocked off the stadium (Still not implemented lol).</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Shift + WASD -\u00a0Dash (No dash if no direction input)</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Left Click - Left Attack, a weaker, fast attack.</p>\n<p>Right Click - Right Attack, a powerful, slower attack.</p>\n\n<p>Some Tips:</p>\n<p>If you are knocked off stage and are high in the air, it's not over yet! Try to make a recovery by airdashing back onto the stage.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0Construction\u00a0Beetle has a longer range than the Pirate Beetle, using it to your advantage is an effective strategy!</p>\n<p>The Pirate Beetle cannot dash or jump! Use that weakness to make space between you and it when you take too much damage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:42:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8baaca9c933ebc37a7080ff2e70065b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DrSlash"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
