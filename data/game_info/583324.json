Your main objective is to get bigger and stronger, equip yourself and prove yourself by competing in the arena. Climb the ranks of the Arena! Prove yourself worthy of the Ruby once and for all.<br/></p>\n<p>The Beta version is now available, which means all core systems are completed. More content, formatting and stuff is now being added to the game. It is Now in a playable state with all the core stuff. At this stage of development updates are coming out very often.</p>\n<p>Currently I'm working on adding more Arena bosses and a few new areas to level up in. I'm always open to suggestions that anyone might have. There is still lots of ongoing balancing but things are pretty good now. The intention of this game of course is that it's supposed to be hard. There is still late and mid-late game balancing to work on.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for an ideal gaming experience, when the game opens, click on the top left corner of the console window to open a menu, and go to Properties. Click on the Font tab, set the font size to 28. then maximize the window. The game will take care of these steps eventually.</strong></p>\n<p>Join me on reddit!
