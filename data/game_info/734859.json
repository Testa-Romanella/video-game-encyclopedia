This game could have really benefited from an open world map so that it could go in more directions instead of from left to right. Curved collision would have just made it a lot easier to not get stuck on corners. I might try making this again in a game engine or graphics library.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T03:54:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ee/9eeb1cfba7f04c0ef49b4f7cc2821972.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["void Games(play);"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
