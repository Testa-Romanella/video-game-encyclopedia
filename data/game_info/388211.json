Let me know what you think about the concept, and if it runs OK. You can also contact me by twitter or email.<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Additionally, I've created a google form that can receive data from your game session. If you want to send it, there is a share button at the end of the game. The data I want to gather is:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The melody created while you play (new random melody each time you play).</li><li>\u00a0The OS you are using (checking if it works on Mac/Linux).</li><li>Input device (checking if it works with other controllers).</li><li>\u00a0Date you played and time you took playing it.</li><li>OS language (to check where players might come from. This is just for my own curiosity).</li></ul>\n<p>Again, sending this data is optional.
