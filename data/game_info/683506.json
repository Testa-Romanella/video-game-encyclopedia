{"id": 683506, "slug": "evolation-demo", "name": "Evolation Demo", "name_original": "Evolation Demo", "description": "<p>Evolation - It is a game about evolution and natural selection. The original idea was for the game to consist of several stages, similar to the famous game \"spore,\" but with the idea that the world of the game lives and progresses without the player's participation. But since I haven't worked on the unreal engine before, I decided to start small by making a concept of what the \"creature\" stage would look like</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The game is implemented 12 levels, in which the player gradually open up new genes and opportunities, put new conditions.</p>\n\n<p>The game has basic animal characteristics that affect an animal's survival in a particular environment.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Size - affects the size and maximum amount of energy stored by the animal. Also affects +x^3 energy consumption.\u00a0Larger animals can kill smaller animals, the animal must be 25% larger to kill.</li><li>Speed - affects the speed at which the animal moves, and energy consumption when walking +x^2</li><li>Sense\u00a0- affects the radius of visibility of the animal, affects energy consumption as +x</li><li>Lifetime - influences the time of growing up, the time of fecundity, and the time of old age. The more, the less often animals reproduce, but live longer.</li><li>Carnivore\u00a0- affects the aggressiveness of the animal, and the percentage of digestibility of meat food. If an animal has 0.2 carnivore, it gets 80% of its energy from plant food, 20% from meat food.</li><li>Viviparity -\u00a0 is the percentage of time an animal actively spends in childhood. It also affects the amount of energy required to give birth to offspring. If the parameter is 0.2, then 80% of an animal's childhood is spent in an egg, and 20% is active. Allows you to protect your offspring from predators.</li><li>Syngenesis - the higher the percentage of sexual reproduction, the more diverse the animals are born.\u00a0When the value is 0, the animal uses single-sex reproduction and does not need a partner.</li><li>Mutation - is the percentage by which the parameters change in children. When the value is 0, the parameters of the children are identical to the parent\u00a0</li><li>Color and bodytype -\u00a0is used for animals to identify their own and strangers. If an animal has a similar color and body shape, it is identified as an ally.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Animal sizes</p>\n\n<p>Leg length is a measure of speed</p>\n\n<p>Eye size is a measure of sensitivity\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Women have eyelashes and men have moustaches as a gender marker</p>\n\n<p>This is my first project on the unreal engine.\u00a0 Unfortunately, I am temporarily unable to continue developing the game, as I will not have internet and tools for a year.\u00a0But as soon as I get a possibility, I will continue to develop a\u00a0new project, with a similar idea but with a larger scale: with multiple stages and multiplayer.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T04:53:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/551/55156ac220cf0c3ca367c716ee768bfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MRowa"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
