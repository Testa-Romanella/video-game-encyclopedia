Game is a sandbox where the player is not limited by class, or lvl/skill cap. The game is being developed for mobile devices. At the moment: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>there are two locations where the player can gain experience, items and gold\r\n</li><li>each type of equipment has its own skills and statistics, for example, light equipment gives more damage, and heavy equipment gives us more health\r\n</li><li>you can sell redundant items to the blacksmith to clean up your inventory, or upgrade your health vial to the alchemist so that it returns more health and has a faster cooldown\r\n</li><li>after putting on the equipment, you can see how the character changes (visually)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p> You can change your equipment at any time, drop your heavy armor and stop being a warrior, give points in intelligence, put on a wand and become a mage  In the future, of course, I'm planning more locations, monsters, items, weapon skills as well as the possibility of developing them, bosses, etc. I would like to ask for opinions, and \"criticism\" what you think failed and what works well Thanks! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T10:53:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4e/e4e53efae0e72e8df08d5236233d9b31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grajo69"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
