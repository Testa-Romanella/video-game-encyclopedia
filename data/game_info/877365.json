They're silent, rich, and <em>super</em> hot. The spring flower dance is only a week away!\u00a0Can you win their affections and score a date with them to the dance?<br/></p>\n<p>Stardew Valley meets Monster Prom in this visual novel! You can play as Sebastian or Abigail and visit Cindersap Forest and Town Square. This is a fan project with a group of volunteers who liked the idea on TikTok. If you want to help us expand it in the future (more characters, more locations, more scenes), feel free to reach out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each character has three possible endings. Can you unlock them all?</p>\n<p>Also worth mentioning, this is fan art, so we don't want to profit off it! It's free to play here, we ask that you\u00a0don't download or distribute it elsewhere. &lt;3 We hope you love it!\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>This project was made possible with the help of a lot of awesome volunteers!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Led by IfThenCreate (Reagan, she/her).
