{"id": 290271, "slug": "tonbo", "name": "Tonbo", "name_original": "Tonbo", "description": "Tonbo (\u52dd\u866b) is the Japanese word for \u2018dragonfly\u2019 and the name of an extraordinary flying machine you can pilot in this absorbing solo board game of exploration and adventure at the edge of civilisation.<br/><br/>There\u2019s a fortune to be made along the frontiers beyond the safety of trading posts, but mountainous and volcanic world is different every time you play, so no-one knows what\u2019s out there, and to travel safely, you\u2019ll have to create your own map.<br/><br/>As you explore each new landscape and create your maps, you\u2019ll score points for how much of the land you\u2019ve chart. You\u2019ll discover geological features that limit the travel of your flying machine and create an ever-growing maze you must navigate around.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll also discover hazards that must be avoided, and some that can be exploited with alchemy to create precious gems. These are worth a fortune to traders at the outposts and if you can create and collect them, you can fly them back to the outposts to sell them.<br/><br/>You start with only a little money in savings, but if you collect and sell gems, you\u2019ll have enough to buy more fuel for your flying machine each time you return, upgrade it so that you can fly farther and collect more gems on each journey, and repair damage and make it tougher.<br/><br/>It\u2019s up to you to decide how to spend your money, but if you run out of money and can\u2019t buy any more fuel, you won\u2019t get a second chance and you\u2019ll have to start all over again in a new landscape - so fly carefully and spend wisely!<br/><br/>The game is complete and playable, but we have many plans for future content in upcoming versions. These will always be available without any further cost, in-App purchases or similar charges, so you can enjoy the game as it grows for a reasonable, one-time cost.<br/><br/>Tonbo is a collaboration between software engineer Lachlan Scott Matsuda, and graphic artist Clodia Aune Matsuzaki, with unique, engaging gameplay and wonderful comic-style visuals. <br/><br/>All the controls are very simple:<br/><br/>Single Tap to Move<br/>You can move as far as you like around the parts of the map you've explored, but you can only move hexagonally.<br/>Moving costs energy, and moving in straight lines is slightly cheaper than making course changes.<br/><br/>Double Tap to Chart New Areas<br/>You need to chart new areas of the map so that you can remember what\u2019s there, discover resources and avoid hazards.<br/>Your score is the total number of map tiles you chart, and charting also costs energy.<br/><br/>Long Touch to Interact with Features<br/>Some of the features in landscape can be targeted, and will show a golden outline and cause Tonbo to act appropriately.<br/><br/>If you target a hazard, it may be that the interaction will change it, perhaps also yielding more or less wealth. You\u2019ll need to work out what\u2019s worth targeting like this, or not.<br/><br/>If you target an Outpost, Tonbo will land there and you\u2019ll be able to buy, sell, repair and upgrade Tonbo.<br/><br/>Good luck, brave explorer!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:34:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/811/811e345182c0df0bda3c8385a99f07cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lachlan Scott"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Lachlan Scott"], "esrb_rating": null}
