Growing up watching this cartoon really filled my days with laughter and fun, appreciating the animation, the story, the comedy and the work behind every episode of the series. It is really an honor to witness such an art like this and because of that, I tried making a game from Bitsy that is inspired from the series itself, wherein I will be playing as Jerry and the very goal of my game is to collect all the pieces of cheese that you can find or locate in the game and the biggest goal yet is to eat the largest and humongous cheese that is hidden somewhere inside the house.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:10:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2b1c328f4d59076d2097de4079ec2bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["chrlivnnsg"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
