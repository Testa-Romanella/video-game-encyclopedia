Because of it, you would be unable to see more than a few feet away.<br/>But, do not be gloomy! We observed that evil trees would only move when you cannot see them. We think that this would help you recognize them faster.<br/>Yet beware! Our last \"expert\" tree hunter died when they went in. Investigation shows that passing by an evil tree without chopping it down gives it enough time to move in for a kill.<br/>You can move around with\u00a0\u00a0 WASD\u00a0 /\u00a0 AQSD\u00a0 /\u00a0 Arrows\u00a0 , chopping trees you consider dangerous to the sustained survival of this establishment by moving towards them.<br/>Until we meet again, good luck.\r\n<p>The Haunted Forest is a simple puzzle game, a kind of a cross between Theseus_and_the_Minotaur, a logic maze by Robert Abbott, and Tents, a logic puzzle by L\u00e9on Balmaekers. Needless to say, it doesn't have much of the logic elements of either.</p>\n<p>The player starts out in a sparse forest of trees, able to see only a short distance away. Most of the trees are normal trees, and do nothing special. Some of the trees, however, are evil trees, a bit reminiscent of the Old Forest in The Lord of the Rings. Those trees would move when out-of-sight. In addition, if the player moves away from a grid square next to such a tree, after that tree having moved at least once after been seen earlier, the tree would kill the player.<br/></p>\n<p>The player wins of they eliminate all evil trees. The player loses if they eliminate more normal trees than the total amount of evil trees, in addition to losing when dying.</p>\n<p>The player can move around using WASD, AQSD (for azerty users), or the arrow keys. Moving towards a tree removes (chops) the tree.<br/></p>\n<p>A few preset game modes are provided with the game, though other modes are possible by tweaking the settings.</p>\n\n<p>Made over around 3 hours for TriJam 83. The theme was \"trees\" (with the quotes), and I hope I captured its essence by having about half of the trees be not-actual-trees.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:48:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1af/1afc3dfeca31a4014e6f4ac2f1fcbcb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["bojidar_bg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
