Take a snapshot of a situation, and you can travel back in time to that moment. Your original self will carry out your actions, leaving you free to slip past enemies or carry out a multi-directional assault.<br/></p>\n<p>This version doesn't have any wider objective - enemies will spawn in from time to time and you have infinite lives. Just play about with the time travel and see what you think.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>Controller:</p>\n<p>Left stick or d-pad to move</p>\n<p>Right stick or A to shoot</p>\n<p>Left trigger to take a snapshot</p>\n<p>Right trigger to resume from snapshot</p>\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<p>Cursor keys to move</p>\n<p>Z to shoot</p>\n<p>C to take a snapshot</p>\n<p>V to resume from a snapshot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:01:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72d/72d61d2785939a1a16181064c19c8a68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mostlyfictional"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
