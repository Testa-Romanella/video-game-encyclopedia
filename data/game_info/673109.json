Life can take you in unexpected directions, and it's often not possible to go back. Step into the shoes of Jacob, who learns this difficult lesson firsthand during his repeated visits to his favorite childhood park. As time takes its toll, what will be left of the place he called home?</p>\n<p>This game illustrates the theme of \"ruin\" in its purest form, as the inevitable passage of time will eventaully erode the places we feel can never change, the people we fell we'll always be with. It presents the inescapable ruin lying ahead, but challenges players to find the silver lining. Perhaps, if more people faced this truth head-on while still finding their own reason to persevere, society could go about living in a more hopeful manner.</p><p>To run the game, download the provided .zip file and launch \"At the Park Final Build.exe\" from the extracted contents.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please keep your sound ON while playing!</em></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>ENTER - Advance dialogue</p>\n<p>1 or 2 - Make dialogue choices when prompted</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99b928a217980f50d5e24c2c08c9170e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["arib510"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
