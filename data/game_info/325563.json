As you progress, find more towers, as well as collect passive upgrades and active items. With a limited number of towers, players are able to quickly move their towers around the room to encounter the greatest current threat.</p>\n<p><strong>Prototype 3:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a very early demo of the tower movement mechanics, and the ability to traverse from room to room.</p>\n<p>All Art and UI is prototypical and not in any way intended for the final release.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are only 8 rooms, and a set enemy type configuration. Waves are now more dynamic in terms of spawn time.</p>\n<p>What I would like to find out from this prototype is:</p>\n<p>1. Whether the ability to move towers is an engaging mechanic.</p>\n<p>2. How the controls feel.</p>\n<p>3. Whether there are any bugs.</p><p>4. Feelings about switching between rooms after every wave.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback on this prototype, please let me know in the Community section of this page.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T15:06:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cf/5cf00cbfabc4aab84c30d5d99f14faff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nickstern"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
