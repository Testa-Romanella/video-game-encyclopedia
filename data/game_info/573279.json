The only way for humanity to have a future is to return to the stars and confront them. But, it will require a lot of ingenuity and help to recover everything that was lost, and even that might not be enough...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAground is a Mining/Crafting RPG, where there is an overarching goal, story and reason to craft and build. As you progress, you will meet new NPCs, unlock new technology, and maybe magic too. Will you be able to raise dragons? Launch into space? The sky is literally not the limit. Beneath its simple exterior, Aground hides a lot of depth and surprises that will keep you wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\n\nWhat can you do in Aground?\nWhile it starts simple, Aground slowly evolves into a much larger game with tons of features and things to do.

Aground is certainly inimitable and in great measure to be combined with complete originality and euphony. Many of the pieces bring excitement, nostalgia and joy to the players/listeners. Each track is carefully crafted to compliment hours of game-play never to become monotonous. It conflates funky rhythms with psychedelic synths in juxtaposition of idiosyncratic time signatures that have never been used in the history of video game music ever before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis deluxe edition of the soundtrack (the original of which was released in 2019) includes 7 additional tracks never heard before, 2 tracks originally from the game Deity Quest, and 3 pieces of sheet music transcribed and arranged for solo piano by David Peacock: \"Ancient Aquatic Energy,\" \"Brave Crusader,\" and \"Nightly.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Aground (Original Game Soundtrack) [Deluxe Edition]\" was made possible by the following individuals:<br/>\n<br/>\nChase Bethea: Composer<br/>\nIsa Alc\u00e1ntara: Album Artwork<br/>\nKyle Johnson: Mastering Engineer (Moontech Studios)<br/>\n<br/>\nTRACK LISTING\n<ol>\n<li>No Boundaries 4:08</li>\n<li>Primitive Tech 4:18</li>\n<li>Tarragonavion 2:09</li>\n<li>Dance with Dragons 3:16</li>\n<li>Desert Biome 4:36</li>\n<li>Cigam Oodoov Lleps 4:34</li>\n<li>Grimoire Architect 4:04</li>\n<li>Brave Crusader 4:17</li>\n<li>Industrial Tech 4:16</li>\n<li>Technically 4:20</li>\n<li>Door to the Spirit World 4:42</li>\n<li>Subaqueous Metropolis 3:56</li>\n<li>Intro Scene 0:29</li>\n<li>The Passage Between 4:57</li>\n<li>Abyssal Depths 4:31</li>\n<li>Colonial Function 4:11</li>\n<li>Taiga - Forest Theme (from \"Deity Quest\") 4:26</li>\n<li>Aground Trailer 1:29</li>\n<li>Manic Mayhem 4:08</li>\n<li>Nightly 4:16</li>\n<li>Advent Cosmic Odyssey 5:54</li>\n<li>Neila Enemui Bar ambar 4:19</li>\n<li>Wild Encounter 4:08</li>\n<li>Maars Metaalchemist 3:45</li>\n<li>Onslaught (from \"Deity Quest\") 1:38</li>\n<li>Hive Dive Havoc 4:11</li>\n<li>Purification (Part I &amp; II) 2:46</li>\n<li>Wrath of the Preeminence - Part I 2:02</li>\n<li>Wrath of the Preeminence - Part II 1:46</li>\n<li>The Blue Marble 4:08</li>\n<li>Remains 2:43</li>\n<li>Bionic Civilization 1:14</li>\n<li>Ancient Aquatic Energy 3:48</li>\n<li>Natura Sanctorium 4:20</li>\n<li>Lament of the Isle 0:20</li>\n<li>Aground Trailer Remix 1:59</li>\n<li>No Sky Limit 1:05</li>\n</ol>\n\n\nWho are We?\nWe\u2019re Fancy Fish Games - a small indie team that has released 12 games, 5 commercially (including Aground), since 2012.
