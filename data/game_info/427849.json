In time, they fashioned for themselves a new existence birthed from the ashes of a world long dead.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Clad now in aluminum and steel where once there was only vinyl and fabric, the players continue their game.  Draped in the names and colors of teams whose meanings were already long lost to the ashes of time.<br/><br/>And still the play.  A thousand metal fists raised in unison in a cold, heartless chorus of servos and motors rising like an iron phoenix from the rusted carcass of the world. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Their singular purpose now hard-coded into the soulless metal forms that carry them onto the field day after darkened day, driven by the same singular binary command that has fueled their gridiron obsession from the days before the world was dead:  01110100 01110111 01101111 00100000 01101101 01101001 01101110 01110101 01110100 01100101 00100000 01100100 01110010 01101001 01101100 01101100...<br/><br/></strong><br/><br/>Become the virtual quarterback you were programmed to be.<br/><br/>2MD VR Football Evolution is a room-scale two-minute drill VR arcade experience where players take on the role of quarterback tasked with capturing victory in the final minutes of a game.
