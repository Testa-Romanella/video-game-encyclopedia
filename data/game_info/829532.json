The main goal for this was to make a space fairing and simpler version of Shadowrun. I adore Shadowrun, but it's dense and very hard to get people into.</p><p>The way this game works is that it's a heavily modified version of PBTA, I only kept the dice results system of 2D6's, and ideally the focus of being mainly about the roleplaying aspect, rather than the combat. Although I did add A LOT of options for if you wanted to fight.</p><p>You'll notice that while the rules could occupy maybe 8 pages, the rest of the core rule book is primarily options. <br/></p><p>I'm posting it on here because I primarily want to share it with people in order to gain feedback so I can polish this into a complete and fun game. If you play it, and have feedback and suggestions, please let me know, but also please don't be a dick.\u00a0</p><p>Have fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T10:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f50c48a2d582c375c5372d3a6d73493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Char_Lottie"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
