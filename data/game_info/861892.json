Fortunately, as the very god of time, many temples were erected by humans in honor of Ticky, who is able to teleport to any of them.</p>\n<p>Your quest is to help Ticky restoring peace in all of the dimensions, but beware : you will warp to another space-time every ten seconds!</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>Time Warp is a mash-up between a platformer, a roguelike, and WarioWare. Each run will have you complete a series of 10-second levels, which are randomly chosen. Levels come one after the other seamlessly, and you certainly won\u2019t have much time to figure what\u2019s going on ! Collectible hourglasses are scattered in every level, but can you grab all of them before the next warp ? Risks and rewards ! If you collect enough of them, you might be able to level up and improve your abilities !</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br/>- \u00a0 <strong>26 short stages</strong> to discover, changing for every run !<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>4 game modes</strong> so even beginner platforming players can have a go !<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>11 abilities</strong> to unlock : double-jump, air control, crushing enemies\u2026<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0 Cute-ish, minimalist graphics, yet with some nice <strong>visual effects</strong> !\u00a0 <br/>-\u00a0 Too many <strong>10-second music loops</strong> !</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Move with the Left / Right arrow keys and jump with Ctrl, Shift, Space or even the Up arrow key !<br/>Don\u2019t forget to turn the <strong>sound ON</strong> as the music helps figuring out how much time you have left !<br/>Please note that there might be a sound bug in Firefox, you might want to use Chrome instead.
