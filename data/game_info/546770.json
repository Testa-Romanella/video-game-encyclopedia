As head coach, it will be your responsibility to manage your team's strategy, play through seasons, recruit new players, and above all, win national championships.<br/><br/>When you start your career, you'll inherit a roster of 48 players (23 starters) and you can select how you want them deployed by picking from different playbooks on offense and defense. Each of these playbooks gives your team different in-game stat boosts that could help (or hurt!) them against their next opponent.<br/><br/>Your team will play 12 games in the regular season: nine against your conference opponents once and three out-of-conference games. The most important game of the regular season is your rivalry game: winning it will net you more program prestige points, while losing it will cost you some.<br/><br/>Want to put on a headset and roam the sidelines yourself? You can call plays LIVE by selecting the \u201cPlay Game\u201d option when starting a new game week! Each playbook has 10 different plays to choose from, hand-selected from historic and current team playbooks and each with their own unique set of in-game bonuses. Don\u2019t want to worry about scheme or routes? Turn on \u201cBasic Playcalling\u201d mode in the Settings panel and cruise to victory with a simpler set of plays on your play sheet.<br/><br/>As your team progresses through the season, pollsters will determine how good (or bad) your team is compared to others. Where you\u2019re ranked will be determined by a number of factors: wins, margin of victory, strength of schedule, and more, and determines who gets into a bowl game and the semifinals (and therefore the National Championship game). At the end of the season, your team will gain or lose prestige based on their final ranking versus their expectations!<br/><br/>After the season is over, you\u2019ll get to recruit the next class of players that will lead your team to bigger and better wins. You'll face off against teams across the country for the same players, and your program's prestige will affect how good the players available to you are. Stronger teams will be able to recruit higher-quality players, while weaker teams will need to allocate their effort strategically in order to build up their rosters.<br/><br/>All of that sound fun to you?
