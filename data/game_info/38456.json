In the game, New York\u2019s streets are flooded with dangerous dancing zombies. Sam and Max are working in the Freelance Police. Their goal is to kill all the zombies and confront their leader, a European vampire. The characters try to find a resolution in Stuttgart, Germany. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player performs as the anthropomorphic dog Sam and a hare called Max. The player&#39;s goal is to solve puzzles - Sam and Max are in fact detectives - and complete various tasks. There are the usual branching dialogues which let the player make decisions, choosing between the given options. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a parody 3D-universe based on typical stereotypes about Germans: Night of the Raving Dead mocks Germans lacking any sense of humor, classic vampire stories like Frankenstein, and the main antagonist, an emo-like vampire. The dialogues between characters have the usual TellTale sense of humor; there are also some plot twists. Jazz soundtracks also complement the game.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2008-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e34/e34401ace14ecb65e2997eb5c9b377fa.jpg", "website": "http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax/nightoftheravingdead", "rating": 3.02, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 49, "owned": 910, "beaten": 34, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 46, "suggestions_count": 477, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 46, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
