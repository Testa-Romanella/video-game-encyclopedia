After brainstorming and developing different ideas, we decided to create something inspired by Greek mythology, with an astrological twist. We incorporated the theme by positioning the protagonist on a boat, sailing down a symbolic River Styx (the gateway between our world and the underworld in Greek myth). The player controls the protagonist\u2019s boat as they collect stars and form constellations while reminiscing about the loved ones who have shaped their life.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T15:21:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b6/4b6c027ac63be24096c1772b48664a4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TeamOrange"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
