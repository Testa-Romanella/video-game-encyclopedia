Grab as many of your lost power cells as you can before you run out of power and/or crash into a planet and/or sun!\r\n</p>\n<p>--------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>This project was expanded from my entry to the TweetTweet jam, in which you had to make a game in 560 characters (two tweets) or fewer:\u00a0https://aristaeus890.itch.io/orbes-inter-orbes</p>\n<p>I decided to make a quick deluxe version to pack in a few things I couldn't squeeze into the original version. It doubled in size and now is exactly 4 tweets long!</p>\n<p>Some New Features:</p>\n<p>Sound effects: one whole!\u00a0\u00a0(It takes one more character to play any other sound effect than 0 so there's only 1!</p>\n<p>Music: One excellent whole track, created by\u00a0@RobbyDuguay\u00a0via\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2619.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Better collision: collision is now measured using two whole pixels instead of one,\u00a0making it feel far better</p>\n<p>Jet effect: A little flame comes from the bottom of your ship when you jet up. There wasn't enough room to do the same for left and right!</p>\n<p>An orbital ring indicator. This makes it far easier to judge your course without having to eyeball it.</p>\n<p>60fps! It takes more characters to run a game at 60fps for reasons.</p>\n<p>A lovely\u00a0title screen! (I would have loved to format the title text a little better but hey, that takes more characters)</p>\n<p>An even less descriptive fuel and score counter! I couldn't spare the characters, they make sense in context anyway I hope!</p><p>Devlog:\u00a0https://aristaeus.neocities.org/posts/2021-06-22-Bits-and-BobsOrbes-Inter-Orbes-...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/250/250d33460d260147175947cca54c4580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aristaeus890"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
