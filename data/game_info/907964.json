{"id": 907964, "slug": "radial-rampage-circle-survival", "name": "Radial Rampage: Circle Survival", "name_original": "Radial Rampage: Circle Survival", "description": "<p>\"Radial Rampage: Circle Survival\" is an arcade survival game developed with AI assistance. The goal of this project was to explore new workflows for programming and game design that utilize AI tools. In particular, I used OpenAI's ChatGPT for game design and programming assistance and GitHub Copilot for additional programming support.</p>\n<p>Overall, the use of AI in the development of this game was effective. AI assistance has the potential to shorten iteration times, especially for solo and indie developers. However, designing with AI also presents challenges, such as the need for natural language interaction, similar to pair programming or working in a small team. Additionally, while coding workload was reduced, debugging and understanding the code was still required. Thus, this approach is not viable without prior knowledge of the programming language and framework used (Lua and Love2d in this case).\r\n</p><p>For details about the design process you can watch the video about the project here:</p><p>[Check Back Soon]</p>\n<p>Or explore the project on GitHub:</p><p>[Check Back Soon]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T08:32:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26b/26b6c5f3bc4d0a05587f1291a552748e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sidremus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
