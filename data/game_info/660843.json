I'm a 3D and 2D artist/animator with no programming background\u00a0that loves games and always wanted to make one, so I decided to learn Unreal Engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inspired by games that I loved as a child and still love as a grown up, such as Mario 64 (and all the 3D Mario franchise), Banjo-Kazooie, Crash Bandicoot, the 3D Sonic games\u00a0and many others, I started making this little collectathon-style 3D platformer. I also always liked the idea of being\u00a0able to fly around freely, so I threw that in too.<br/><br/>I'm still working on this project and would love to hear some feedback from players. You can download it for free.\u00a0If you do, make sure to let me know what you liked and what you didn't like about it! Also, if you think this has potential, you can make a small donation.<br/><br/>[This prototype is best played with a gamepad, but it has keyboard support as well]<br/>[The sound design is in very early stage, most sound-FX currently in the game are\u00a0placeholders, and there is no music yet - hopefully I'll be able to get to that soon]<br/>[Only available for Windows at the moment]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T19:59:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8e/b8e69bc9bc40648e176651540c22d059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexandre Marcati"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
