PLEASE READ THE BULLET POINTS BELOW.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tama-goth-i is a very simple pet game made in 7 days for Scream Jam 2021! You can feed your ghost, play with it and dress it up in hats. Keep your ghost happy and alive!</strong></p>\n<p>Although I wasn't able to finish many of the ideas I had for this pet sim,\u00a0I'm really happy with how it ended up - even though it's more of a concept/toy than actual pet sim. My original idea was to have multiple horror monsters for pets, such as vampires and zombies but realized the art\u00a0would eat up too much time.\u00a0I can also see a couple of other issues but I feel this was a great learning experience and I'd love to expand on it in future!
