From an idea by <strong>Sid Sackson</strong>.</p>\r\nRules\r\nTwo Combinations and One Reject\r\n<p>The 5 dice are thrown and the player the divides the 5 numbers into two \"combinations\" of two dice each and one \"reject\". The two combinations are marked in the top columns and the rejects\u00a0 is marked in the bottom.</p>\n<p><strong>For example</strong></p>\n<p>The player throws a 1, 1, 2, 4 and\u00a05.</p>\n\n<p>One of the many ways in which can be divided is by combining a 1 and the 2 to make a total of 3, combining the 4 and the 5 to make a total of 9 and leaving a 1 as the reject.</p>\n\r\nOnly 3 Rejects\r\n<p>The player continuing in this manner, throwing the 5 dice and dividing them as he choose. He, however, is limited to 3 different reject numbers, and the player must divide the dice so as to have one of those\u00a0 3 numbers as the reject.<br/></p>\n<p>If, after the reject numbers have been set, the player make a throw containing none of the three numbers, he gets a \"free ride\". He can choose any two combinations he wishes and ignore the fifth die.</p>\n<p><strong>For example</strong></p>\n<p>1,2 and 5 have been marked as the rejects. A throw made 1, 4, 4, 4 and 6. The player has no choice but to divide the dice 4 and 4, 4 and 6, with 1 as the reject.</p>\n\r\nThe Game Over\r\n<p>The player continues throwing the dice until one of the three reject numbers has 8 marks placed next to it. Play is then completed and the game is scored.</p>\n\r\nTO DO\r\n<ul><li>Credits page</li><li>Sound (and background music?)</li><li>In game help</li><li>Classic mode?</li><li>Desktop or mobile version?</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T05:15:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/273/2733fc22ba02b242fb191dc69ef2492b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Strani Anelli"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
