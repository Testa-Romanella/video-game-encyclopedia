(Demo)", "description": "<p><strong>My Sweet Zombie! </strong>is about Sam Chen, a recent college graduate who loves to bake. However, she can\u2019t\u00a0 remember the last time she touched an oven, unless you can count the conventional one they use at the cafe she works at. Sam\u2019s job usually involves putting out fires at her store, so whether it's dealing with a annoying\u00a0customer or fixing the leaky espresso machine,\u00a0it\u2019s Sam\u2019s job to take care of it. Thus it's no surprise she finds herself exhausted from her job.<br/></p>\n<p>However, now that Sam has graduated from college,\u00a0her parents are pressuring her to get a \"real\" job.\u00a0 Will Sam be forced to take the path her parents want, a stable, but boring career as an accountant...? Or ... Will a cute girl with a bony arm change that?</p>\n\n<p>CONTENT ADVISORY: 17+ for death, crude/suggestive humor, excessive swearing, emotional abuse, biphobia, and sexual content</p>\n<p>--------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>MAIN CHARACTERS<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\n</em></p>\n\n<p>--------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Visual Novel, Comedy, Romance, Drama</li><li>Female Protagonist with a Female and Male Love Interest</li><li>3 Endings (+ A Poly Ending)</li><li>OST made by the amazing MockOff!</li><li>Partial Voice Acting!</li><li>The Opportunity to see scenes from the love interest's perspectives!</li><li>And other fun extras!</li></ul>\n<p>--------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Artwork and Writing: Tsun-Angelique</p>\n<p>Ui, Scripting, and Emotional Support Friend: M.</p>\n<p>Ren'Py Gui Template by Baiyu</p>\n<p>Music Composed by MockOff</p>\n<p>Voice Actors:</p>\n<p>Jess Rico Hatton as Sam</p>\n<p>Cat Protano as Zombie Girl</p>\n<p>Mylo Reid as Liam</p>\n<p>Chloe Eves as Jane<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T06:18:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d03e4c1858ea8c23e000a958734d005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tsun-Angelique"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
