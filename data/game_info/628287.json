Then the game will adjust the difficulty of enemies in different ways (speed, spawn frequency) and element in the world such as item drop rate. Different skills are scored differently such as accuracy and timing and are adjusted according to how well the player is performing against a distribution of other players data.</p>\n<p>The maps are procedurally generated using a Perlin noise algorithm I wrote for generating natural looking terrain.</p>\n<p>Currently the statistics server isn't available/functional so no data is sent or received from the game, this version is totally offline. The game will still attempt to adjust difficulty however the accuracy of this will be diminished. Each level adds a level of difficulty.</p>\n<p><strong>All sprites, fonts and textures were drawn by me.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T07:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db1/db183371ee0fcd1c84d9a2fb04042fce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PublicStaticDylan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
