In it is the test scenes I've been using\u00a0\u00a0to develop the movement for Spryward. Now I'm releasing it to the world a little early so you can all mess with it and give me feedback.</p>\n<p>What is Spryward?</p>\n<p>The man who cures his city from a zombie virus struggles to retain the society he once knew. Dawning the superhero persona Spryward, Deshaun Martin takes on a corporate political infrastructure that suppresses society's revitalization. Spryward faces off against super powered villains, zombies,\u00a0 a wizard, and a cyborg\u00a0 made of Dendicium the Metroborg. Platform from panel to level as this comic book video game hybrid takes form.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Why Spryward?</p>\n<p>Instead of turning into a zombie, infection gave Deshaun green skin and super powers. He can manipulate friction on an electromagnetic level. This allows him to slide and stick to any surface. He can halt his own connection to gravity for a short time causing immense heat with flames.\u00a0Along with friction based powers he has super strength, increased range of hearing, and durability. One punch from Spryward has enough force to shatter a diamond. Dendicium is the only known substance that can penetrate his skin.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T14:31:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c13/c13b4bbbdb618f29f627ef334c0370f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Williams", "Noah Lewin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
