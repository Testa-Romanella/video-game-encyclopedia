The viruses have accidently been run though, and that must be fixed before government documents will be lost and thus heavily reduce our national security.</p>\n<p>You will\u00a0around clusters in the server that are referred to by HMCF as \u201cWorlds\u201d. There are 8 worlds in total, each world having 4 levels. However, as you progress, the enemies you encounter are more powerful.</p>\n<p>Your aim is to fight these viruses by coming into contact with them. When this happens, you will be\u00a0put into a battle room, where you must fight the viruses using the battle commands that you have. These are explained to you when you hover over the buttons.\u00a0You can only progress to the next level when you have defeated all viruses in the level.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>P.S. This game was made as coursework for a Java module at university. I know it has some quirks, but I tried to make it as polished as I could, and thought I would release the final build to the public. I am not planning to maintain this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:03:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7ef19fdbd67d825d6b41bd9b2a38a330.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["rhys-wootton"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
