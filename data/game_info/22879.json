It is a completely free, fast-paced first-person shooter without hard graphical violence. Red stars instead of blood indicate hits and colored cubes replace guts as gib effects. \n<br/><br/>\nSpeed and movement is what Warsow is all about. Like a true cyberathlete you jump, dash, dodge, and wall-jump your way through the game. Grab power-ups before your enemy does, plant a bomb before anyone sees you, and steal the enemy\u2019s flag before they know what is going on!<br/>\nAn open source engine that gives you the freedom to make gameplay mods.\nPowerful e-sports features such as Warsow TV with OGG audio stream support for providing improved streaming capabilities.\nHighly customized graphics settings that allow flexibility for both competitive and casual play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-02T15:06:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b3/6b36ee5fc04694742802d6bc00ac3ef6_ZwonMkK.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.09, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 138, "owned": 1049, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 43}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 117, "suggestions_count": 365, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 117, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Chasseur De Bots"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Chasseur De Bots"], "esrb_rating": null}
