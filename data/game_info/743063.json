WASD to move, aim with the mouse, left click to shoot zombies, right-click to build, scroll while in Build-mode to change material, from spikes to boxes. Boxes help stop the zombies(not for long, though), while spikes damage the zombies AND the player, so be careful. You can delete builds if you are out of material or shoot the boxes to make the process faster. Upgrade your gun to shoot from bullets to lasers, to explosives. Destroy trees to get wood and rocks to build spikes. Look at your stats to see from your firerate to your inventory.\u00a0Finally, you can\u00a0collect other upgrades for your firerate and bullet speed to upgrades for homing bullets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>*WARNING: This game may have browser errors, such as music not loading or sounds delaying.
