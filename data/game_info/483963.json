The Game consists of cells on a grid. These cells can either be dead or alive and can change their state based on these three rules:</p>\n<ol><li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</li><li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li><li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li></ol>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The only input required from the player is populating the grid with live cells. \u00a0This version of the game lets the player place their own cells, randomly spawn an amount of cells, or choose a preset layout. The speed at which the game updates the grid can be changed in the menu and while the game is running. You can also set the amount of live cells and the seed for random layouts, change the border behaviour, and change the colors for live and dead cells.<br/></p>\r\nMenu Controls\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Left/right - change setting</li><li>Up/Down - move to previous/next setting</li><li>X - Start Game</li></ul>\r\nGame Controls\r\n<ul><li>X - Pause</li><li>Z - Back to Menu</li><li>Up/Down - Change Speed</li><li>Right - Update Grid Early</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:06:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e40b9161ffc58990a268ee21f554260.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jonny Hunter"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
