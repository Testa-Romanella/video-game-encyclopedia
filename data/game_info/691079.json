The game mechanics enable the player to create his own path through a dungeon by moving rooms around. The concept for this game started with the question how it would be to have randomly generated levels that the player can change to his advantage. Because of that,\u00a0 random levels were built with the restriction that they all have the same size. These levels should be able to be controlled by the player therefore the idea of moving the rooms around was born.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T05:08:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/055/05531b8ad6e500cb23ea6182ef1736ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NonamePlay"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
