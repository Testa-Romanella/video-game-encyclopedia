However this is unlike any sandbox game you have ever played! This is a survival sandbox game with just about an infinite amount of possibilities, each time you play it will be a unique experience because each world, galaxy, mob, and even item are all procedurally generated. The textures, uses, and more are all unique to that block, it's a one of a kind, all the blocks, mobs, items, and plants follow this same logic. I'm sure the builders here are happy to hear there are blocks of just about every color with many textures.</p>\n<p>Be sure to join the official Orbetorian Discord server to receive updates, submit feedback and bugs, and get some info about future releases!</p>\n<p>Link:\u00a0https://discord.gg/cRU9RqCag8<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:36:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/855/8556709e21469c58fabf98aa2071c4d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Orbetorian"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
