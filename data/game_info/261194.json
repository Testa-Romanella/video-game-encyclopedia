At first they assumed a meteorite. After further investigations, however, it came to a different conclusion. It is an instestellar metal object that seems to be equipped with technical components. A spy satellite now begins to visually capture the crash site. It is an extraterrestrial being.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe military immediately sends units to this crash site to secure the object. What the military does not know is that some teens are already on their way there. The adolescents will arrive a few hours in advance, which is why they are alone without contact with the outside world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis creature seems to be evil because it builds an altar that generates tremendous energy. According to calculations, the room is curved, creating a crack in the room. A portal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe only ones who could prevent this are the teenagers. The military will not reach this island in an hour. The altar, however, is finished after the calculations in 30 minutes. The young people have to act accordingly. To signal them, an old rocket is blown up and a siren is activated.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.- -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game currently includes a multiplayer game. In a 1 against 4, you are against the creature with a maximum of four teenagers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe creature is protected by the altar with an energy shield and can not be damaged. The only way to harm him is to disable the altar. This only works if enough energy is generated to reverse the beam and override the altar. Of course, the creature must fight it and kill the teenagers to make their plan a reality. Once the creature is defenseless, it can either be killed by the teenager or managed to kill them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo: Be the creature and fulfill your evil plans or be a teenager, be the last hope for humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat else is planned:<br/>\r\n- Storymode (Singleplayer)<br/>\r\n- More game modes for the multiplayer mode (Last Dawn, Multiplayer Storymode, Catch It)<br/>\r\n- Several maps<br/>\r\n- Many characters and creatures<br/>\r\n- Implementation of community proposals", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de2/de2050b9fcdb03152a745b9238b40651.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Snowdrama", "tylobix"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tylobix"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
