(Although I don't really find this fun, only a slightly interesting mechanic lol).\u00a0I appreciate any kind of feedback to help me improve this game :D(critics are absolutely fine as long as you give me things to improve).\r\n\r\nHow To Play?\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>AD - Move Left and Right</li>\n<li>Left Click - If an enemy is inside your attack range, activate the <strong>TIME PAUSER</strong> skill. Time stops for 2 seconds (wait what) and you click your mouse as many times as possible for this duration. After that, the enemy takes that amount of damage.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Check this out maybe</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discord Server</li><li>Instagram</li><li>Insane Game Jam: Future</li><li>Game Jolt</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T05:51:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0bcb68ff27be824d858983f595a722f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Revolution Game"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
