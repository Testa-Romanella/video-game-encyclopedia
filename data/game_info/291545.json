{"id": 291545, "slug": "come-spring", "name": "come spring", "name_original": "come spring", "description": "<p>\"come spring\" is a 2D side-scroller exploration game. With pixel art (yay!). I started working on it quite recently and it is a learning experience (not an experienced game dev here). I use Godot game engine and Pyxel Edit for art. Currently available download is a short demo version of the game. Alright, it's hardly a demo version. If the game was a painting, this would be a rough sketch. If it was a human, this would be a ribcage with a couple of internal organs. Maybe a brain. There is no proper art, no animations, and effects. Not even sound! Most of what I 've planned is not implemented.<br/></p>\n<p>The main feature of the game is the three layers of the terrain for you to move around on, instead of the one in traditional 2D platformers/side-scrollers. The game is slow paced and does not feature enemies for you to fight. Instead it will focus on exploration. <br/></p>\n<p>I'm putting the game out here in such an unfinished state because I want to get your feedback as soon as possible. Since I'm still learning how to make games, I could use as much feedback as I can get, and as soon as possible. So, leave a comment down below.
