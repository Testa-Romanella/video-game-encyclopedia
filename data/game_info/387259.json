He has a dream to become leader of the whole of Greece, a dream he will follow until his death...<br/>Choose one of 30 playable factions ranging from mighty Sparta or Athens, ambitious Macedonia, slowly declining Achaemenid Empire and its power-hungry satrapies, to a number of smaller Greek city-states and groups of semi-nomadic societies living on the outskirts of the Hellenic world. Lead your nation to glory if you can...<h3>Lead, rule and conquer</h3>Your task is to do more than survive.
