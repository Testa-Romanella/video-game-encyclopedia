I have been wanting to make a digital version of Pinball for quite some time now. One 'bug' with the compiled version of this game, is that explosions do not activate. This makes the game kinda bland when hitting enemies or the big bouncers, but there is still screen shake, so I have not left you with no excitement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e46db5ce5c6fb792e27470ca3efefc97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Zackton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
