The tornado will become so uncontrollable that changing its direction will be harder almost having a mind of its own.   </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T05:26:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/743/743f0a9f8e71a8016531612bc19fa24a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JTGriffith"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
