The only thing that matters today is mechs - giant, powerful robots. And you? Well, you make loads of money on them. After all, you are a mech mechanic!<br/><br/>Features in prologue:<br/><br/><br/>Work on 3 completely different and unique enormous machines of the future. Each built with more than a thousand parts.<br/><br/><br/>Mechs used in humid environments often stop working because of rust. Fire high powered laser beams at the rusty surface of a part to burn it away.<br/><br/><br/>Parts breaking is the most common damage you\u2019ll find on a Mech. Use this futuristic welding station to scan, locate cracks and finally weld the mech parts together.<br/><br/><br/>Why own a gigantic machine if you can\u2019t show it off?
