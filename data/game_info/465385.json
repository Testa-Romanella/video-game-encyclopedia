Reply to emails, answer to phone messages, have a coffee break, or simply go to the toilet, you'll need to manage your time effectively to stay healthy.<br/></p>\n<br/>The Jam\r\n<p>This game was created for the occasion of the 48h 2020 GMTK game jam, with theme \"Out of Control\". We've attempted to follow this theme by portraying stress and the speed at which things that are normally in your control can lapse out of your reach.<br/></p>\n\r\nThe Team\r\n<p>The game was made by a team of 4, though the artist of the team had to leave before the deadline. On coding, Pankaku (find his work at https://pankaku.itch.io/) and myself. On art, Virtue.\u00a0 And on music, Paquito, or \"My Friend Emily\", who scored her first game with this jam!
