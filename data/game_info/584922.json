Play around, have fun, construct your universe. But remember, nothing lasts forever. And entropy is always increasing.</p>\n<p>50+ unique entities to play around with.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: <strong>Recommended that you download the game. The browser can do strange things.</strong> Also, sometimes you can get stuck in a position where you can't play anything because you only have personal items and nowhere to play them. In this case, you'll have to restart. Sorry about that, I didn't have time to balance it a hundred percent correctly. It should hopefully be rare.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>There is a limited amount of time. Use it wisely.</p>\n<p>Every cosmic card can be played onto the field. Personal cards are played onto cosmic cards. But cosmic cards can only have a number of personal cards equal to their population.</p>\n<p>Click on a card, then click where you want to place it. You must click continue before you can play again.</p>\n<p>When you click on a Personal card, there will be an indication of where it can be played.</p>\n<p>Life can only be played in habitable environments.</p>\n<p>Objects will interact with each other.</p>\n<p>Every object has an entropy cost, and a cost they produce per turn. The game ends when the entropy hits the limit.</p>\n<p>Every card has an age. They will die when their age runs out. The age is a number of \"turns.\"\u00a0 A turn is simply when you, the player, places a card. To continue onto the next turn, click continue.</p>\n<p>Some cards will also advance the tech of your universe. This will unlock new cards for you to play, such as life, or rockets.</p>\n<p>Use the scroll wheel or Q\u00a0(zoom in) and E (zoom out) to zoom. The scroll wheel can be finicky in browser.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move the camera around.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Ross Kilpatrick - Design, Writing, Programming, Art</p>\n<p>August\u00a0Muller - Art</p>\n<p>Song - Fragile Data by Blear Moon, licensed under Creative Commons</p>\n<p>Link to song:\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Blear_Moon/expanding-lands-2020/fragile-data-...</p>\n<p>Sound Effects - Scribble by Tomoyo Ichijouji and Chalkboard eraser by Mernenagel</p>\n<p>Link to sound effect:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Tomoyo%20Ichijouji/sounds/211247/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Marnenagel/sounds/408501/</p>\n<p>Made using Godot 3.2.1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T06:32:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eea/eea6cd3001f1527c309b42dcc0a0b843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Functional"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
