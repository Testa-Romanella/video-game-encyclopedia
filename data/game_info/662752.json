Here's a mini-game, this time featuring Kundek, the commissioner's OC! In this one, you can feed her the food that drops on the right side of the screen. If she eats too quickly, though, her tendency to get hiccups arises.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>R to restart<br/>Check the toggle buttons before passing the warning screen! The normal/hyper button toggles how extreme the size range is. The popping button toggles whether Kundek's belly pops when overfilled or not (she'll be fine if it pops, just dazed). If the button says \"no pop\" then don't worry about it happening.<br/>Click-and-drag food to move it (it's tricky to catch it mid-fall, so you might want to wait for it to stop bouncing.)<br/>Left click Kundek's belly to shake it up, if you're impatient to giver her hiccups. Only works sometimes.<br/>Hold right mouse button to rub Kundek's belly, reducing pressure and curing her hiccups.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to KhanaArts for being the first person to commission me!
