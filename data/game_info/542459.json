{"id": 542459, "slug": "insight-rylynn", "name": "Insight (Rylynn)", "name_original": "Insight (Rylynn)", "description": "<p>Insight is a 3D horror-oriented puzzle game with a core gameplay of stealth and surveillance, a realistic art style that renders a dark, abandoned school environment.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in a high school at the end of the last century, and the main character returns to the abandoned school after many years. The main character is here to find out the truth -- who he is and what happened to the school.</p>\n<p>We've had several versions of the identity of the main character. Initially, for dramatic effect, we wanted the good student to be the one who likes to monitor others, while the main character starts out thinking he's the victim until he realizes he's the one sitting in the control room. But this seems too simple, and the player can easily guess this reversal. So after some discussion we added a character to take on a second victim. The main character is indeed obsessed with spying on others, but he is also the victim and is led down this path. The real perpetrator takes advantage of the conflict between the main character and the new character to achieve his own ends.</p>\n<p>The part about the plot can be seen by the small notes hidden in the scene, which are passed to each other by former classmates. There may be rumors, or the real truth may be told in a joke. It can also tell us what people think of others.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T07:27:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13d9b720a45b1ebd19adeafac5b91840.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rylynn"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
