Click on the last waypoint to start the carts journey.</p>\n<p>When you arrive at a city you'll be able to trade goods with them. The prices that cities trade goods at is defined by that kingdom's supply and demand of each good. Selling a good to a city will increase that cities supply, often reducing the trade price. The supply bonus wears off over time.<br/></p>\n<p>Travelling is costly and dangerous. Each tile your cart travels across will have a cost and chance for being raided. The cost is determined by the terrain type. The chance of a raid is determined by how desperate the people of the kingdom are.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T11:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a6/6a65c38a81f09325908290b9eb50409a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["turpitron"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
