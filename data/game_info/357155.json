We say different.<br />\nA bunch of deeply unique and deeply flawed individuals have been chosen for greatness. Heroic, noble, enlightened... Just 3 of the many words they can\u2019t spell. They will set off on an epic journey that will turn them from zeroes to almost heroes. Or dead people. More likely the latter.<br />\nJoin these zeroes on a quest to become heroes in an ancient land. Train them to learn battle skills, magical powers and which end of a sword is the business end.<br />\nIn Almost a Hero you\u2019ll find quests, secrets to unlock and there&#39;s lots of clicking to do. Yup, it\u2019s a clicker game. Have you nearly got what it takes to become almost a hero?<br />\n\u25c6AWARDS\u25c6<br />\nBest Mobile Game &gt; reddit&#39;s Incremental Games community (2017)<br />\nPublic Choice Award &gt; Gamelab (2017)<br />\n\u25c6JOIN THE COMMUNITY!\u25c6<br />\nDiscord &gt; https://discord.gg/almostahero<br />\nReddit &gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/AlmostAHero/<br />\nFacebook &gt; https://www.facebook.com/almostaherogame<br />\nTwitter &gt; https://twitter.com/almostaherogame<br />\nInstagram &gt; https://www.instagram.com/almostaherogame<br />\n\u25c6SUPPORT\u25c6<br />\nContact us at support @ beesquare.net for help with:<br />\n&gt; payment issues<br />\n&gt; bug reports<br />\n&gt; tips on how to upgrade your heroes<br />\n&gt; or just to share your love for idle games with us</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-29T13:39:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/037/0374f28462f829242bd51aca4831b870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Bee Square Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
