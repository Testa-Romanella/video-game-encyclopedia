Characters, art assets and music were borrowed from other games and artists; copyrights belong respectively to their owners.</p>\n<p>This was the first version I worked on and plays like a visual novel. A point and click adventure version was made after this one and can be played here. This version has a different story and script but uses the same two characters and spiritually exists in the same universe.</p>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE: </em></strong><em>Please forgive some spelling and grammatical errors in the game's script. Given the chance, I would re-write a lot of sections to clean things up, cut down on redundant dialogue, and ground some of what the two characters say as some of it gets incredibly cheesy. Thank you for your understanding!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emotion Theory"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
