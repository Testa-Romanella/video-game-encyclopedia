Mazes + monsters + shooting.<br />\nRun around the infinite, ever changing corridors of the NEON DUNJUN, gathering flowers and shooting everything. ZAP!<br />\nGrab the key to the next floor.. try not to let monsters take it off you. Once you&#39;ve picked all the flowers, the doorway shall appear...<br />\nGrind the walls for a speed boost and the power of squishing!<br />\nTwo player device sharing mode. Take a friend along to help and/or hinder you.<br />\nGame modes:<br />\n.oO( Standard ) - Start from the start, travel as far in as you can.<br />\n.oO( Shuffle ) - Oh no! Space/time has gone higgledy-piggledy. Play through levels in random order.<br />\n.oO( Survival ) - Same as standard but you only get one life. Make it count.<br />\n.oO( Seed ) - Everyone in the world gets the same set of levels, which changes once a day. Replay the day&#39;s levels as many times as you want to compete for highscores.<br />\n.oO( Arena ) - Trapped! There&#39;s just one big level. There&#39;s no door. Enemies keep appearing, flowers keep being replenished, the walls keep being blasted away. Oh, and you only get one life.<br />\nDifficulty setting..<br />\n<em> Original - Like Forget-Me-Not 1.0.<br />\n</em> Arcade - Harder! Faster! Scarier!<br />\nProcedurally generated, screen-wrapping, destructible mazes. Tiny little pixelly graphics and zappy retro sound effects.<br />\nGameplay videos:<br />\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVQYGoN6IXM<br />\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuYAf-LVXWU</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T03:02:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b5/9b5ba5ef6995293baa6c235bd3a5235c.jpg", "website": "http://nyarlu.net/blog/forget-me-not", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 459, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Jakyl", "Brandon Williamson", "Featherbox Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brandon Williamson", "Featherbox Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
