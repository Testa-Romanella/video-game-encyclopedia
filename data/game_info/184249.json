I rotoscoped the animation from a footloose clip and edited it into a looped movement. It's not much more than a tech demo and an internet joke so far, but I would like to put it into a fuller game at some stage.</p><p>Please enjoy and let me know what you think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a8/6a89dbd49feed8e3f4622726ee62345d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel J Roberts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
