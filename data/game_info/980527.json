Whether you embark on this journey solo or team up with a friend, you'll navigate through diverse and challenging environments that will test your coordination, patience, and problem-solving skills.<br/><br/><br/>Experience the silliness of controlling two giraffes whose bodies are tied together and move entirely by physics. Control each giraffe by moving their head to climb up obstacles and tumble across fields. Each step and jump requires coordination and thought in order to make progress!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Play through the entire game with a friend! Simple to learn but challenging to master, the controls encourage players to work in harmony. Effective communication and synchronized actions are key to overcoming the game's many obstacles and puzzles.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Practice makes perfect! As you progress, levels increase in complexity. Master the intricacies of giraffe locomotion, adapt to changing environments, and triumph over ever-more demanding obstacles.
