My giftee unfortunately dropped out midway through the jam but I decided to take on a new one! Here's the letter that inspired this game:<br/></p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0hope we\u00a0made a nice game for my giftee and that he enjoys playing it!\u00a0\ud83d\udc96</p>\n<p>This is the first time that we participated in a jam without a dedicated programmer, so we couldn't do anything <em>too </em>complicated.\u00a0We decided to use\u00a0Ren'Py\u00a0and create a visual novel because we were already a little familiar with Twine. The Python syntax gave us a few headaches throughout the jam, but we learned a lot and ultimately had a good time!</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udfb5 Music by Dorkulon</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udfa8 Art by Treslapin</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udcf7 Background photos from Pexels and Pixabay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a404cf5325adfce9ed8e404722ec8bb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["treslapin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
