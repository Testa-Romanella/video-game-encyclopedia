{"id": 756897, "slug": "gladiators-survival-in-rome", "name": "Gladiators: Survival in Rome", "name_original": "Gladiators: Survival in Rome", "description": "Gladiators: Survival in Rome is an Action RPG with casual survival game mechanics and big city-building possibilities. You'll experience a new type of survival game with quests, continuous open world progression, monthly events and your dumb ways to die not harming your fun level. <br/><br/><h3>\ud83c\udff9 Survival Games, casualized</h3><br/>Chop every tree, hunt rabbits and deer, stone and copper mining - resource management are a staple of every survival game, and Gladiators is no different. However, we threw away the hunger games in favor of a replenishing stamina pool so you can start every game session on exploration instead of just preventing yourself from dying.<h3>\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Build your own Roman village</h3><br/>From setting up your first camp to building an entire Roman city, you'll be pretty busy making a home for yourself and all the rescued slaves that turn up to settle as workers. Manage their resource refining jobs, build houses and beautify the city with fountains and other decor.<br/><br/><h3>\u2694\ufe0f Carry a big stick (mind the pointy end)</h3><br/>Craft your weaponry from a selection of clubs, axes, bows, spears and more. Upgrade them to make pointy ends even more pointy, embellish your craft with gems and their attributes, and poke around at Roman legions, bandit bosses and other generally unfriendly folk.<h3>\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Explore Rome and its dungeons</h3><br/>Dive into dark caves and unravel the story of Proserpina, better known in Greek mythology as Persephone; lead the siege to the stronghold of Castrum, or rebuild the ancient city of Perugia. Learning about history has never been more fun!<br/><br/><h3>\ud83d\udcc5 Enjoy Seasonal Events</h3><br/>Keep coming back for freshly designed seasonal events as they happen: the Winterfest with Teuton wildlings, the Origin of Saint Valentine, Halloween and many more to come. Missed one? Don't worry, we've put them into your game progression and keep them fresh every year.<h3>\ud83d\udcf1 Put Rome in your pocket</h3><br/>Not at home?
