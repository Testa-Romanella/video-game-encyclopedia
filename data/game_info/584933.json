If you are suffering from depression or are easily overwhelmed by these topics, I advise you to exercise caution when reading the contents of this VN or refrain from playing altogether.<br/><br/>The game is entirely SFW, though there are some adult non-explicit jokes thrown in for comedic effect. There aren't, nor will there ever be, any explicit scenes or suggestive content in this VN.<br/>There are fight scenes in the novel that feature non-graphic depictions of violence.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T09:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9d8979096fbd521f94b57b59ac1021d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Sedge"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sedge"], "esrb_rating": null}
