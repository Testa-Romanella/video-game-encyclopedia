I think going into this project I was more interested in \"making a tower defense game\" over anything else because the concept of it seemed so alluring. I tried to make it a little more interesting by adding this RTS-like reload mechanic. I think I was on the verge... of something... interesting... but I don't think I quite found the <strong>chaos emerald</strong> in the rough with this one. Not being able to use an Update loop was really difficult as well. Using workarounds was fine, but it did cause repercussions in the form of untracked bugs... I tried my best lol\u00a0I developed such an appreciation for an Update loop, and I can't wait to use one again next week!</p>\n<strong>Mouse Wheel</strong>Zoom In / Out<strong>Right-Click</strong>Move to selected tile<strong>Left-Click</strong>Select menu items / reload badniks<strong>Return</strong>Start the wave", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:40:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b5/9b5758179c62e52c21db4a0e9bd75783.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
