But at the moment I don't have the cash for an exporter (Yeah clickteam fusion charges for exporters). It would be awesome if you could check out my gofundme to help me upgrade to clickteam's developer version, and html5, sfw, android and apple exporters, leaving a dollar/pound or two is a great way to support me!
