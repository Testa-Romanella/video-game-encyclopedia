The player controls DUCK, an agriculture droid who, unfortunately, has been tasked with defending an important piece of technology against endless waves of unsavory folks haling for AmaCorp. Place turrets, avoid damage, upgrade your weaponry, and protect the tower!</p>\n<p>You aren't only allowed your turrets, however. You can shoot your blaster and swing your wrench at all the AmaCorp jerks that get in your way. It's for the best!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are not currently able to be remapped, however if there is enough request for that I will learn how to implement that. The current control load-out can be found in-game. <br/></p>\n<p>Currently only really looks good in 16:9 aspect ratios. I will add support for other ratios if this is requested. <br/></p>\n<p>Pixel animations and background by: penusbmic<br/></p>\n<p>https://penusbmic.itch.io/</p>\n<p>https://penusbmic.carrd.co/</p>\n<p>If you experience a bug please feel free to email me at duckpondgamestudio@gmail.com and I will get back to you asap!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T06:36:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/397/397d7f83b4bf938cb85ecc1411321871.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DuckPondGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
