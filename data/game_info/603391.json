Instead, you're found my <strong>non-sponsored lunchables simulator</strong> I made as a joke.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The cover of this is a screenshot from this\u00a0a very normal article about football. </strong>I kind of\u00a0just yoinked it but it was the reason I made this, so I might as well<br/></p>\n<p>There's only a downloadable version because for some reason it breaks if I try to make it a web game. not sure what I did but Unity\u00a0becomes very unhappy if I try to change it<br/></p>\n<p>V1 is very <strong>simple</strong>. you have crackers. you have ham. you have cheese. you have a reset button. now go and make sandwiches. There's literally nothing else.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>V2 introduces <strong>a </strong><strong>main menu and two more modes of sandwich-making</strong>. Go ham. Or maybe beef. Or perhaps, even pepperoni.<br/></p>\n<p>V3 allows you to <strong>screenshot your creations and share them</strong>\u00a0in case you want everyone to see your <strong>\"amazing\"</strong> sandwiches. The file will show up in the folder you have the game in. (It's V3.1 because I forgot to change some values in the code)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T08:57:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6b/b6b75aab852f47f067447bb257734c5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maxillow"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
