We had the usual crew this time around. The earlier start time gave us all a bit more of a window for work on the first day, but most of the team was exhausted by Sunday. Still, the quality of our work is improving with every game and we have a good time coming up with ideas for Craig Killbane and his next game. We hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Logan Marks\u00a0- Programming (Enemies, Player, Effects, Implementing Assets), Art/Animations (Enemies, powerups, effects), Voice (Announcer), Game Design</p>\n<p>Brodie Beaman - Programming (Tilemap, Obstacle Spawner, Boss Attack), Sound Editing (Announcer, Wizard), Level creation, Game Design</p>\n<p>Chad Gerein - Programming (Enemies, Powerup Spawners, Game/Scene Controller, Cutscenes), Game Design</p>\n<p>Mitchell Maclean\u00a0- Programming (Player, Camera, Slide Transitions, Wizard and Wizard Fight), Voice (Wizard, Senator Swill), Humor Consultant, Game Design</p>\n<p>Brenden Roach \u00a0- Story Board, Slide Art, Craig Sprites, Wizard Sprites, Humor Consultant</p>\n<p>Taylor Seely - Sound Finder</p>\n<p>**Additional credits for free assets are in the project source</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1e/d1ea8cf1ab995791b06b0165a55e27a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Logicon211"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
