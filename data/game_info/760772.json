One night, a group of people unexpectedly caught a deadly virus whose cure is yet unknown, and yet the source of the sickness is quite apparent: bats! Get your pills and sprays ready, and go exterminate the cause! Move with left and right arrow keys to distance yourself from the bats, jump with space to get the high-flying ones, and throw a pill at them with E! Momentarily, there is no Q attack because you forgot it at the lab station (or because I haven't taken the time to add it yet). Make sure the bats don't get past you, as they will then escape. Accumulate enough points before the timer runs out, and most importantly don't get hit by a bat.\u00a0 Good luck in battle, doctor!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T05:56:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fef/fef3a59a4c4d46e50ca2fc51419f1d59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MyCatsAreFat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
