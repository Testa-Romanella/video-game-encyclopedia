Our hero is a student in need of a job. He applies for the position of assistant to a rather strange professor. The interview is not going as expected. Should he have been suspicious when the professor asked if he likes adventure?</p>\n\n<p>This is a very short point &amp; click adventure game made for the Yaz Solo Jam. The theme for the jam was a shape (pretty cool idea). As jams go, the time was short and the game is a bit rough around the edges, but I hope you have fun!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>leftclick - use, pick up, talk</p>\n<p>rightclick - look at</p>\n<p>inventory is at the bottom of the screen</p>\n<p>no save function</p>\n<p>playable in Englisch and German (both text only)</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Engine:\u00a0 Visionaire Studio 5</p>\n<p>Music: FreeMusicArchive.org</p>\n<p>Soundeffects: freesound.org</p>\n<p>Gamedesign, graphics and dialogues: Esmeralda<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T04:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b7/9b7f666bc4e3c8728ecbcc24a757033c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Esmeralda"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
