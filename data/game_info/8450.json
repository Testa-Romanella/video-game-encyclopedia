A sci-fi node-based RTS game with deep tactical gameplay. <br/><br/>Land your harvester on a planet to gather its resources. Connect to an empty resource field to take it over, and build an efficient distribution network between your harvesters. But beware, you are not alone.<br/><br/>Up to 3 enemy AI players battle with you for the last remaining harvester on the planet surface. Be smart and quick to achieve a glorious victory. Use different upgrades, buffs and debuffs to gain the edge over your enemies.<br/><br/>The game has a unique payment model, we call \u201cFree2Paid\u201d.
