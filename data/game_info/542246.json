{"id": 542246, "slug": "endless_overdrive", "name": "[ENDLESS_OVERDRIVE]", "name_original": "[ENDLESS_OVERDRIVE]", "description": "<p>[ENDLESS_OVERDRIVE] is an arcade game about movement. As you move and shoot your way across the grid playing field, the enemies you kill are transformed into stage hazards, constricting the space you have to maneuver through. Build up your combo multiplier to clear out space, all while avoiding the red enemy that tracks your every move!</p>\n<p>The game's soundtrack comes from the Alpha Hydrae album\u00a0Peace\u00a0Love\u00a0Respect Overdrive.
