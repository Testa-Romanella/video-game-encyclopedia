The player is an experienced barista at a coffee shop and has to train a new Barista. The game is played through decisions made during conversations with other characters or just actions. The game starts off as a \"normal\" dating simulation between the player and the new Barista but as the game goes on strange things start to happen to make the player question the Barista\u2019s humanity. In a high stress situation the player has to decide how they will treat the barista. Will they continue to think of the barista as a friend and possible love interest? Or will they think of the Barista as a monster who must be stopped? This decision will change the game into either a continuation of the dating sim or a horror game where the player and Barista play a dangerous game of cat and mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:40:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c0618758009e08a9cd7e984e0369287b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Noble Dragon Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
