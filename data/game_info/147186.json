I didn't have any solid ideas for gameplay, so you just get a typical escape-the-room game. Sorry! Keyboard W/A/S/D for movement, mouse for looking, mouse left button click for interacting with objects. The game ends when you leave through the door. The web version doesn't run as well as the standalone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/158/15896634880d309717e50d1bcdb5229b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spencer Alves"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
