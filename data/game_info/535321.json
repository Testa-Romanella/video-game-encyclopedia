You find yourself in the shoes of a conscious slime that was created by scientists. Quickly, our slimy protagonist learns that he is up for a challenge for survival. Physics matter in this run-for-your-life adventure, where your amorphous shape and the ability to power up and adapt to environmental changes are your only advantage against the traps and challenges the scientists have set up for you. Traverse different levels in a 3D environment with stylized graphics and a relaxing atmosphere while continuing your search for freedom.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - movement<br/>Space - jump</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The slime sometimes dies after spawning</li><li>The slime sometimes dies after stretching too thin</li><li>The camera keeps moving after dying or finishing the level</li><li>Only the main slime is rendered, not its split parts</li><li>The active blob of slime can jump around if the current slime gets smaller than a previous split slime blob</li><li>You can glitch the jump by jumping off the wall</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T07:11:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b97/b97040617266fdf23c5d59ae86d7e1a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ichigo Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
