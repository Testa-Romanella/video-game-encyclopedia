It should have been our first project made on this engine. I never used it by the past, and my friend had short lessons on it. But she realized that she was not yet comfortable with the tool, so we couldn't finish the project on time.</p>\n<p>But, it does not matter because we've past a good time !</p>\n<p>After, she's go home with is computer, and I decided to remake quickly a prototype of our game with a very old version of GameMaker I had on my own computer (That I know better). This is the version you can download on this page !</p>\n<p>Our game is short, a little difficult at the beginning, but I think it's very funny to play,<br/>So, we hope you enjoy it too !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:00:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddf/ddf091c44da1f27dec88277a1540c165.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LapinLambda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
