It took me round about 6 months to create everything except of audio. I used only free music for non-commercial use.</p>\n<p>This game is focused on fun, skills and \"strategic thinking\". Unlike most games of this kind, this game forces the player to allocate his resources sensibly. There is only one level of difficulty and this could be challenging for many. An ingame guide will help you to get to know the most important mechanics and main points of the game.</p>\n<p>Have fun and I hope you like\u00a0my game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:26:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b75daa1f22918a926e6fc1eb9b93444a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevDimension"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
