Snakes Fortress is the long-lost creation of famed game designer Harlon Embridge III, creator of the critically acclaimed Dragonsblood series. Snake\u2019s fortress was often considered his greatest passion project; however, it was sadly stuck in development hell for years before eventually being cancelled in 1986 due to the declining popularity of text adventure games. Lost to time for 36 years, this test build was uncovered on an old floppy disk in a corporate auction. Little is known about the greater context of the game\u2019s narrative; however, the build seems to be near completion.   </p>\n<p>Please note, that Snake\u2019s Fortress is a text adventure game, meaning that your primary way of interacting with the game will be through typing sentences into the console. Unlike similar games in the genre, it seems that the command list mostly consists of the terms EXAMINE, USE, TALK, and ATTACK. However, due to the unfinished state not all commands have been attempted so some outliers may be possible.\r\n  </p>\n<p>With that in mind, get ready to experience a lost classic of the 80s, Snake\u2019s Fortress!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T16:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41e/41ebb99a9e0cfeb30d39e9a42414409d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thelalilulelo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
