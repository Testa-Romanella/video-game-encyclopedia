Each level contains a picture with many objects and some animations to show some progression.</p>\n<p><strong>GameJam and Idea:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Game created for <em>minibeansjam8 </em>with the theme <em>'You shouldn't be here'</em>. The idea of this game is to find the difference in each picture that shouldn't be here.\u00a0If you make one mistake, you have to restart the level.</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/minibeansjam8</p>\n<p><strong>Engine:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Completely done in MS PowerPoint (M365) and no macros were used! The focus was on the mechanics of right and wrong clicks\u00a0and some variety in the picture scenes. There should only be used some standard animations and tools from PowerPoint, so there shouldn't be problems with older versions. Please be aware of other presentation software, because I didn't test it.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Unlock all levels:</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T08:17:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3a/f3a5d559596aec002325060a79c81f74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["johnconnor008"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
