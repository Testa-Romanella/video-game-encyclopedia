Once the player is ready with his turn or simply cannot attack after moved piece, hit the end turn button, then the AI starts his turn. Once the AI is ready with his moves, automaticly the player turn will come, until any of the win conditions is reached.</p>\n<p>Each peace has attack and health as follows:</p>\n<p>Grunt - 1 ATK, 2 Health - move 1 space forward, backward, left or right; attack diagonally at any range.</p>\n<p>Jumpship - 2 ATK, 2 Health - move like Knight in Chess, attack in 2 spaces in the following directions -\u00a0\u00a0forward, backward, left or right;</p>\n<p>Tank - 2 ATK, 4 Health - move like Queen in Chess, up to 3 spaces, attack once at any range\u00a0in any of the following dirrections\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0forward, backward, left or right;</p>\n<p>Drone - Moves 1 space - forward,\u00a0 1 ATK, 2 Health, attack\u00a0diagonally at any range.</p>\n<p>Dreadnought -\u00a0Moves 1 space in any direction, 2 ATK, 5 Health, attacks all adjacent enemy units.</p>\n<p>Command Unit - Moves 1 space forward or backwards, 0 ATK, 5 Health.</p>\n<p><strong>WIN CONDITIONS:</strong></p>\n<p>Player\u00a0wins if all the Command Units are destroyed.</p>\n<p>AI Wins\u00a0if all human units are killed, or one of the drones reaches the 8th row.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.
