This lore it's not in the game, but it'd like to think I didn't come up with this 1 hour before the deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>Re:Ship\u00a0</strong>is a game about underwater survival, about managing a crew in harsh evironments, about not destroying a submarine.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nPlaying The Game\r\n<p>I'm sorry but there wasn't time to do a tutorial, hopefully this will suffice. The whole game is playable with a mouse. You drag and drop units into the rooms and they do stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Heat Room</strong>: Produces heat</li><li><strong>Energy Room</strong>: Produces energy</li><li><strong>Lounge</strong>: Produces happiness</li><li><strong>Training Room:</strong> Gives XP to Units</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Control Room</strong>: Makes the Submarine move</li></ul>\n<p>To win the game you have to reach 1000m of depth. If a room is burning someone with engineering might help ;)</p>\n<p>There are some curious interactions with stats, not as many as I'd like to but try to experiment!\u00a0</p>\r\n\"Multiplayer\"\r\n<p>For some reason I decided to spend half a day implementing a python server to send and receive messages. You can find a <strong>Radio</strong>\u00a0in the <em>Tools</em>\u00a0section. It can be used to send a message to a random player that is also connected at the same time. (I have a moderation system in place so don't waste your time ;)). This is an experimental mechanic that will probably be never used but you can use it to send precious informations to other players. You're not alone deep in the waters!</p>\r\nBackgrounds\r\n<p>Speaking of useless features I have a random background generator for every Unit you control, it's different every time! Not that difficult to implement but fun to see in action!\u00a0</p>\r\nPost Mortem\r\n<p>It's not as fun as I would've liked. There are some minor bugs. But I think it's one of the most polished experiences I've ever released. I learned a lot and it was fun coding it. The game is **not** balanced, and I'd have to play for a few days just to tweak the numbers, hopefully it's winnable. There's a **known bug** where you can die because of a random event and not have the time to read what killed you, sorry :(</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<p>* Coding: thevinter (Nikita Brancatisano)</p>\n<p>* Python Server: tetofonta (Stefano Fontana)</p>\n<p>* Art: thevinter (Nikita Brancatisano), Lorenzo Tomadini</p>\n<p>* Music: Lorenzo Tomadini</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:12:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/232/2329700e946637b9bd4f11f4b7ee5a6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["thevinter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
