In this sequel to Image Fight, players take control of the most \n      advanced spaceship in the fleet. Destroy \"POW\" cases for items and \n      special weapons. Obtain Red and Blue Pods to equip your ship. Red Pods \n      fire the opposite way your fighter is moving, and Blue Pods only fire \n      forward. You can also change the speed of your ship, to adjust to \n      different battle conditions. Defeat the alien invaders once and for all \n      and bring peace back to the Galaxy.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
