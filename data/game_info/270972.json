Combine the two and you get Camera Hunt!<br/><br/>The game is simple: you have 60 seconds to find as many items as possible using your camera. Items vary from everyday objects, pets, something fun, selfies, and more. Take turns against your friends and try to beat your high score!<br/><br/>Camera Hunt uses Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence technology, which isn't perfect, but makes for some interesting results!<br/><br/>The game is completely free and available offline.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:59:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82e/82e09cf74c48340051177dbc23feab8d.jpg", "website": "https://robbieelias.ca", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Robbie Elias"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Family"], "publishers": ["Robbie Elias"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
