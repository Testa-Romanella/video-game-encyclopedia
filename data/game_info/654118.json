I think finding the 3 monsters require a lot of patience.</p>\n<p>I made this game for the HauntedPS1 Summer 2021 GAME JAM ! The theme was SUBMECHANOPHOBIA ( <em>a fear of submerged man-made objects</em> )<br/><br/>If you don't understand how to play, search the \"information\" button in game :</p>\n\n<p>I hope you will like it! Honestly I don't really know if it is fun, It's experimental and for now there is not a lot of content !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T10:55:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cfcdc1f49f3bdec5327b943b84b8f8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Bastinus Rex"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
