This frees up space in your Hand for more Dice.</p><p><strong>2. Activate</strong><strong>\u00a0Skill Tree Nodes.</strong> When clicked, the\u00a0Node will highlight all appropriate Dice Set Selections\u00a0that can be used to Active the Node if you meet its Dice Combination\u00a0Requirement (e.g. Single, Double, Full House).\u00a0Click on a Dice from the Highlighted Set to Confirm Activation and use the Dice.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Some Yellow Nodes are Action\u00a0Nodes that perform Special Actions (see below).</em></p><p><strong>Action Phase:</strong></p><p>Selecting an Action will End Your Turn.

If the concept is sound, we could expand the prototype with missing elements such as:</p><p>- Juice: art, animations, sound effects, music</p><p>- Replayability: more enemy types, more player classes with unique Skill Trees, more interesting\u00a0Skill Nodes</p><p>- Balance, balance, balance</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPED BY</strong></p>\n<p>FatedGameDeveloper - Lead Programming,\u00a0\u00a0Design</p>\n<p>LordBundee- Programming, Art,\u00a0Design</p>\n<p>elCactus - Art</p>\n<p>MountainDigger, Jay\u00a0Adlington - Music</p><p><strong>SHAMELESS SELF PROMOTION</strong></p><p>We were very proud of our 2nd place finish during Game Devcember 2021.
