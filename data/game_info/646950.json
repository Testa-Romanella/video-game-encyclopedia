Use the up and down arrow keys to switch lanes and dodge obstacles, and the left and right arrow keys to speed up and slow down. Gas heals you, while everything else damages you. Press space to fire a rocket if you have one. Watch out for buses and cops! They will appear in the back with a warning when they spawn.</p>\n\n<p>Music by: Lord Phobos</p>\n<p>Main Game:\u00a0https://lordphobos.bandcamp.com/track/galactic-chase<br/></p>\n<p>Title Screen:\u00a0https://lordphobos.bandcamp.com/track/ice-crystal<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T05:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69a/69a19243c66eb43e87ede8beff22175f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Porkchop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
