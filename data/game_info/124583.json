Then grab some power-ups to improve your offense and mobility, and get ready for a final showdown with the boss.</p><p>I started this project less than a month ago. It is my first serious attempt at making a 2D Game and I'm very happy with the results so far. <br/>Given enough interest and support, I intend to elaborate on this design, and add additional mechanics such as Special Weapons, and Shields.</p><p>Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy this humble offering. Please feel free to send feedback.</p><p>-Pierre<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/1983259c6b288b4c4285dcc93edfdad2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mathbear"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
