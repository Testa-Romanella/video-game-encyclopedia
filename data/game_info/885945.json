{"id": 885945, "slug": "stick-survivors", "name": "Stick Survivors", "name_original": "Stick Survivors", "description": "<p>Stick\u00a0Survivors\u00a0is a simple game about surviving an endless onslaught of enemies. This game was inspired by games like Vampire Survivors, Risk of Rain, and an old-school classic Stick Arena.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game sessions are short (~10mins) and the game currently takes about an hour to fully complete. You select a character to play, defeat enemies, level up, get stronger and survive as long as you can to unlock more characters. The game also features a custom character option where you can combine your favorite abilities from the characters you've unlocked to create unique builds.</p>\n<p>I plan to add several more game modes, enemy types(other than just some naked dudes), maps, challenges, and as many new characters as I can manage. I want each character to be modeled after characters from anime, movies, comics, etc. The more characters that I add the larger the possibilities become for custom character builds. I would also like to add high scores and mod support if the interest is there.</p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments what characters, modes, or features I should add next.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>(WASD) - Controls character movement</p>\n<p>(left-click) - Basic attack</p>\n<p>(1 or right-click) - Dash ability</p>\n<p>(2 &amp; 3) - Combat abilities</p>\n<p>(4) - Ultimate ability</p>\n<p>(Esc) - Pauses the game</p>\n<p>(Tab) - Level up</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T13:22:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6e/c6e7df9c5cdb71189789ac29bbe230ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mini"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
