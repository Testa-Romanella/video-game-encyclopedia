Aim and time your shots as you shoot water at an ever decaying flower in the hopes of making it grow. But be careful, every drop you use reduces your own size, until there is nothing left.</p><p>'Growth and Decay' was made for a game a week class, with the weeks theme of growth/decay. Due to a few factors I only had about 6 hours to work on the game. it's mostly a mechanics test, but I like the way it balanced out. I could see the size/life = ammo system working for a puzzle game perhaps. I could also see the whole scene being adjusted into a multiplayer mini game.</p><p>Enjoy, and let me know what your thoughts are.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b98867e98a2a17c6a8767db4b82fb118.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel J Roberts"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
