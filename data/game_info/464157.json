Our game fit the them by forcing the play to juggle more things than they would comfortably be able to, hence being \"out of control.\"</p><p>unfortunately, we weren't able to submit in time, so we didn't get in. but we had a lot of fun making the game and learned a lot.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/752/7528041d5fc7b5f8c23472e17b865874.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CovalentBonds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
