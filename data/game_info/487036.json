Ants continue to move to the last place you sent them to, even after you release the mouse. They'll stubbornly try to stay there if pushed.<br/>2. Drag a group of ants upwards into the air, and they will slowly form into a column. Columns/towers are very useful for getting past low lasers.<br/>3. Ants can climb other ants, and can climb walls.<br/>4. Ants are very strong.<br/>5. Sometimes you need multiple groups of ants with their separate instructions to achieve a level's objectives. You can use one group of ants to create a ramp, while other ants push the item up the ramp.<br/>6. If an ant or item falls into a chasm or gets fried by a laser, it will respawn at the start point.<br/></p><p><strong>Tools: </strong>Unity (game engine), Tiltbrush VR (for making 3D artwork), Blender (for cleaning up meshes), Tiltbrush Toolkit/SDK for Unity (importing Tiltbrush drawings).</p>\n<p><strong>Third Party Assets:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>MUSIC: \"Attic Secrets\" by Rafael Krux (CC 4.0); \"Dawn of the Apocalypse\" by Rafael Krux (CC 4.0); \"Days of Glory\" by Rafael Krux (CC 4.0);\"Ghost Town\" by Rafael Krux (CC 4.0); \"Hillbilly Swing\" by Kevin MacLeod (CC 4.0); <br/></p>\n<p>SOUND FX: Ants by Manuel Calurano (CC0); Electric Zap by michael_grinnell (CC0)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aadca9839b0f26fc216d356f479f131.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["andyman404"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
