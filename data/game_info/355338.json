The real guitar is too big so you can't take it every day. But your iPhone is always with you! So we made the guitar simulator for true music lovers who want to create and play music often. <br/>You'll find different types of electric guitars and acoustic guitar. Also, there are some guitar effects pedals every guitar player must have like distortion, chorus, delay etc<br/>Please, rate us if you like this app!
