Possess humans.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>Doropu is always watching you.</em><br/><em>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</em></p>\n\n<p>Your journey begins in\u00a0<em>Daemonia</em>, known by humans as \"Underworld\".<br/>As the new in charge of\u00a0 the \"Possess &amp; Sacrifice\" section, your job is to recover humanity fragments possessed by humans in \u00a0the Overworld and bring them back to Daemonia.<br/><em>Humanity fragments </em>are Daemonia's currency, and everything in Demonia <strong>has a price</strong>.<br/><br/>To earn humanity fragments you have to <strong>Occupy </strong>and <strong>Possess </strong>a human.<br/>In order to do these tasks:<br/>1. Find the prey you prefer (defended by entities called <em>Guardians</em>)<br/>2. Attack and Occupy their souls<br/>3. Defeat each Guardian that is defending the soul</p>\n<p>The <em>occupation phase</em> has a timer (which you can increase with enough humanity fragments).<br/><br/>If you die during an <em>occupation</em>, you will lose everything.<br/>If the occupation phase's timer is up before you defeat each guardian, you will be kicked out from the soul, and his human will vanish.<br/>If you succeede during the occupation phase, you will <em>possess</em> the human's soul and will control as many guardians as your <em>control power</em> will allow you (you can increase your control power with humanity fragments).<br/>These guardians will fight with you against human's guardians during your next occupation phase.<br/><br/>Each time you possess a human and earn his humanity fragments, guardans of the humans remained in the Overworld will become more and more strong.<br/><br/>Choose wisely when to get back to the Underworld: once you are there, if you access the Overworld you will lose every progress you've made, and you will have to possess, earn fragments and control guardians again.</p>\n<p><em>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</em><br/><br/><strong>LEFT CLICK</strong>\u00a0 - Melee Attack<br/><strong>WASD</strong> - Movements<br/><strong>E</strong> - Interact<br/><strong>TAB</strong> - Statistics<br/><strong>ESC</strong> - Menu<em>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</em><em>A game by:<br/>fenicenera (Nicol\u00f2 Santilio)</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<em>\n<p>Music, graphic and concept:<br/>fenicenera (Nicol\u00f2 Santilio)<br/><br/>Font:<br/>HamletOrNot<br/></p>\n<p>It was my first attempt to make a game during a jam, and also my first attempt to make and publish a game ever.<br/>Even though it is not completed due to university and several commitments,<br/>I am proud of what I have achieved in almost 4 days and I will keep on updating this<br/>little project with all my effort and motivation over the jam.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing.</p>\n</em>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>KNOWN BUGS </strong></em></p>\n<p><em>(I'm writing them so everyone will know and be aware of them.
