Play soccer (football) with all your emotions.<br/>Your goofy characters are hard to control, but once you understand how to deal with them, you can position them at the ball to kick it far.<br/>The two included mini game show off the 3D physics model of the game featuring physical character interactions. Tap the screen to throw balls at goofy men.<br/>The characters will try to balance themselves, and/or fall over like a ragdoll, then try to stand up.<br/><br/>The match time is one minute, just like in every sports.
