But have learned a lot in game maker in the space of a week to do. Including all items, weapons, animations, a lot still needs to be finalised and sorted. Fans of the original will clearly see what needs to be finished. Consider this more of a tech demo. It will be free for all to download even when its finished. This is simply a fan remake that I love working on. Tough as the fluffies and enemies seem to be.. I think ive pretty much got the rest ok. Ive added in new fruits and will probably add new modes and extra bonus rooms to spice things up a bit. Some of the weapons still need aligned and well.. it will take a while to complete. But happy with what ive done so far. I hope fans of the series and the work of the original developers will enjoy this. Updates will come soon.</p><p>The item, the flag will work in taking you to the treasure room. However it may take you a few levels ahead in the game. This is due to the room order in game maker. This specific room will require further editing to ensure you proceed to the next room as in the original. Keep this in mind.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/121/121b6d8c6ae00655d22e1cda24838d44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Craig A.
