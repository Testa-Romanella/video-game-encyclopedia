Players must keep the power level of each station in check or the system will overload and fail!</p>\n<p>The pilot: This is the main station, similar to the old school asteroids game. The player at this station is responsible for mitigating damage to the ship by avoiding and shooting asteroids! They must also be careful not to hit friendly ships in the are. And of course, we thought it'd be a good idea to upgrade the power flux generation cycle (??) of the engines- unfortunately this has resulted in the unintended side effect of the engines... uh... exploding. Use the thrusters to disperse the power!</p>\n<p>The radar specialist: This station supports the pilot by locating asteroids in the nearby area. This station plays like the classic snake game. The unlimited power however causes the snake to grow constantly! Disperse the power by using the spacebar (good luck!). Collecting the \"food\" will reduce the spawn rate of asteroids for the pilot. Colliding with your body will reset the game and confuse the pilot, but energy overload would be much more devastating</p>\n<p>The weapons specialist: This station is responsible for manufacturing missiles for the ship... but... well, I don't think we really need that much fire power though? Too bad, we can't let the power level of this station to overload or the whole ship will explode!! Assemble missiles to prevent a system overload, but try to give your pilot a heads up- as soon as a missile is manufactured the ship will fire it! There will be civilian casualties... watch out!!</p>\n<p>The coms specialist: This station is responsible for warning nearby friendly vessels to steer clear of the area! This station is similar to a code-breaker type game. Submitting a correct code will reduce the number of spawning friendly ships, and an incorrect code will confuse friendly ships and cause even more to spawn!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:16:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/429/4298d5fbe0e9d8afc62dfe1d83985893.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mac15001900"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
