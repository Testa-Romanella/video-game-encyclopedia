When she tried to make her Mistress acknowledge her worth, she turned into a Bot-Volant by accident! This is quite a tricky situation, and she has to turn back on her own before the Great Witch comes back...</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the game is to create a metamorphosis potion that will turn you back into a human. It may seem quite simple, but you're gonna have to rack your brains! Fortunately, you can now open a menu to see the items collected and save your game, in case your mind goes into overdrive...\u00a0<br/><em>Taking notes while playing the game would be a great idea.</em></p>\n\n<p>And that's it! I hope you'll like playing this game. The current best time is of about 15 minutes, but I reckon 20 seems about right if you don't want your brains scrambled.<br/>Please tell me how long it took you to complete the game - even if you feel like it took you too long! - and if you had fun! See you soon! \u2665</p><p><strong>\u2665 Thanks a lot to Gazolus for the translation !\u00a0\u2665</strong></p><p><em>(Little fact: \"Bot-Volant\" is a word from a dialect of the Vosges (France) that stands for \"bat\", and that I like a lot!)</em></p>\n<p><strong>French version here !</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/611/611de4666c476ba69d378ce3a5a5e6fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tsukimagi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
