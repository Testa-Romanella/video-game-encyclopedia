(PC & Mac Builds Only For Now)", "description": "<p>This is a really basic prototype for a 2D Endless Runner that I am creating for our first TokiJAM (Tokyo IndieDev Game Jam)! More details to be provided as the game is upgraded with graphics, sound, and additional features! (Win &amp; Mac Builds for now).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The STORY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>MiaBee(\u96c5 - her name means \"elegance\" &amp; \"grace\" in Japanese) has just left home to do her daily chores and collect some pollen for making delicious honey-glazed sunflower seeds (because she`s an excellent chef)! But as soon as she stepped outside, the sky turned dark, some goons started attacking her and littering her home with garbage - and to top it all off, now she`s being relentlessly chased by a HUGE and seemingly indestructible group of monsters!\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>Seriously? What does a girl have to do to get a break?\u00a0</p>\n<p>How about kickin` some @$$ for starters!</p>\n<p>Litter-bugs? Not on HER watch! This cute, swift, and crafty little honey bee`s got a serious sting, and these guys are about to feel it! So strap in for some lightning-fast reflex and shooting action while helping MiaBee clean up her yard and take out the trash (enemies)!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How to play (at the moment)!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>* Move - W, S, A, D (keyboard keys for Up, Down, Left, Right)<br/>* Left Mouse Button - Shoot<br/>* Right Mouse Button - Pickup &amp; Release Paper (the PINK circle)<br/><br/><strong>Game Goals (at the moment)</strong><br/>* Pickup and carry the PINK circle (paper) to the YELLOW goal squares (Recycle bins)<br/>* Shoot and kill the RED &amp; ORANGE enemy squares<br/>* Avoid the BLACK obstacles and the DEMON approaching from the left side (instant kill)<br/>* Pickup and carry the BLUE bomb to the demon in order to knock him off the screen and give yourself more time to collect paper garbage. (You can shoot the demon with your guns too, but that only pushes him back a little bit...)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Don`t worry, we`re just getting started with this game now that the weekend is over.\u00a0 I`ll do artwork, bug, fixing, add more features, and polish it up over the next 3 days until the Game Jam is time limit is up. But since there are no games posted yet, I wanted to get at least something up</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T10:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/615/615f92c18fdef2bc9e32d738abc468e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["cre8tiveMediaVault"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
