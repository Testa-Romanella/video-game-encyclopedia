Can you figure out what's going on?</p>\n<p>Made for the Game Jobs Live Game Jam, under the theme \"One Time Use\". I wanted to create a game where the player has a \"one-time-use\" pistol, but thanks to time loops, you get to keep using it.</p>\n<p>Controls are available in the \"tutorial\", however here they are:</p>\n<ul><li>E/F - Interact</li><li>Ctrl/C - Crouch</li><li>Right Click - Draw Firearm</li><li>Left Click - Fire Firearm</li><li>Space - Jump</li><li>Tab - Inventory</li><li>ESC - Menu</li></ul>\n<p>There is currently no support for non-standard displays, 16:9 is all that I built on, though I will be polishing to add support for UW throughout the week. My plans for polish are:</p>\n<ul><li>Support for UI beyond 16:9.</li><li>Adjusting writing to be more/less cryptic in response to feedback.</li><li>Fixing issues with clipping and transparent objects.</li><li>Fixing any bugs that arise.</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>I am a lone developer, though I got royalty free SFX and music, which is credited in the game, as well as fonts free for personal use.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:14:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9de609cc78bafdab053662676b9490fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steeley"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
