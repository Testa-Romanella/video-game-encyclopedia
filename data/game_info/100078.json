The GGJ page with extra info can be found here.</p><p><em>Welcome to the happy world of Gary SpringArms. Once, Gary was a legendary greeter and waver, gaining substantial muscle through continued waving. Until one day when he tragically lost both his arms in a double blending accident. He thought his waving days were over. Just when Gary was at his lowest, he was gifted with springs for arms. Now, Gary speeds down the street greeting people with this new, springy, wavey arms! He must make up for time lost by greeting the shit out everyone in his town.</em><br/></p><p>---</p><p><strong>But how do I greet someone, we hear you ask. <br/></strong></p><p><strong>Use the ARROW KEYS Left and Right to swing yourself side to side, as you wave your arms you speed up! Wave like a madman for maximum velocity and greeting power. </strong></p><p><strong>Avoid the stop signs and smash into the pedestrians for score. The faster you smash someone the more score you get.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01a6d1b9c99f3641673d0f4b5fbfcc19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Team Gormless"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
