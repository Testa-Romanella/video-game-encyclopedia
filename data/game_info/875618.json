{"id": 875618, "slug": "the-evil-hour", "name": "The Evil Hour", "name_original": "The Evil Hour", "description": "<p>***Please note that this game may not function properly in private browsing/Incognito mode.***</p><p>Narrativized as one possible prequel to Nietzsche\u2019s <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em>, <em>The Evil Hour</em>\u00a0juxtaposes Nietzsche\u2019s prior work <em>The Joyful Wisdom</em>\u00a0(sometimes translated as \u201c<em>The Gay Science</em>\u201d) with Augustine\u2019s early work on <em>True Religion</em>, situating both pieces as life-affirming answers to the spiritual threat of negative self-talk. The narrative setting of a Zarathustra character's origin story functions strictly in service of the work\u2019s chief aim: to see <em>The Gay Science</em>\u00a0and <em>True Religion</em>\u00a0in a new light.</p>\n<p>More specifically, <em>The Evil Hour</em>\u00a0points to parallels between these two works through the accusations hurled at Z by S, the game\u2019s primary antagonist. Having been branded a heretic by his colleagues in the Priestly Council, Z faces an imminent threat of death by hemlock; S, who would have Z go the way of Socrates rather than escape with his life, seeks to draw Z into a self-destructive nihilism. In response, Z can answer S\u2019s remarks with verses drawn from Nietzsche or Augustine, illustrating how <em>The Joyful Wisdom</em>\u00a0and <em>True Religion</em>\u00a0address comparable issues in comparable ways.</p>\n<p>A secondary purpose of this game is to suggest an alternative interpretation of the four-book structure of <em>The Gay Science</em>. Passages selected from Nietzsche are intended to be (relatively) representative of the Book (I, II, III, or IV) in which they are located. Scholars are invited to consider whether any merit might be found in mapping S\u2019s four disparagements to the core themes of the four books included in the first (1882) edition of Nietzsche\u2019s work (disregarding for the moment the Prologue and fifth Book added in 1887).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T13:58:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9c/a9c07ef78ef87e8f7d3d4b39307402ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wbmattis2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
