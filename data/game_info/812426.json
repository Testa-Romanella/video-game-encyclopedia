Ever thought about how much <em>stronger</em> that feeling must be when <strong>YOU'RE the driver</strong>? What may driving with the bus <em>empty late at night</em> feel like? This thought is what set me up to make this game.</p>\n<p>In a <strong>PS1 style setting</strong>, you are a bus driver completing your night shift. You are <em>getting tired</em>, getting the last people off the bus to their destinations, until you're all alone. <em>What might happen?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Start game: <strong>X</strong></li><li>Look arount: <strong>Mouse</strong></li><li>Next chat: <strong>Space</strong></li><li>Zoom: <strong>Right Click</strong></li><li>Gas: <strong>Hold W</strong></li><li>Brake:<strong> Don't hold W</strong></li><li>Quit game: <strong>O</strong></li><li><em>You can change the sensitivity with the slider on the menu</em></li></ul>\n<p>I'm a beginner developer from Portugal, this is the first time I've ever finished a project and I'm really proud of myself. The game is really short, but I hope you like the experience nonetheless. If you encounter any bugs or problems please tell me. If you feel like donating any ammount, that would mean the world to me and hype me up to develop more games!</p>\n<p>If you're a content creator you can record my game - I would\u00a0love you to, actually! As this is my first published project, any feedback is really useful and it would be so cool watching someone play it :)</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for checking my game out!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-15T05:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19a25ad98fd2c20e50a067698a71aa66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TKB Barracks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
