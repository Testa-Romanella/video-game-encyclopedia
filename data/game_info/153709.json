Press and hold the left mouse button to sink faster and aim for the gaps, even though you can't change the sub's heading.  It rewards patience and timing!</p><p>Originally a smartphone game, but it works fine with a mouse - see if you can get the timing right and beat my best score (which is 23 on the mobile version).</p><p>Hopefully I'll find time to upload it to the app stores (just for the sake of it, I doubt this would make much money!).</p><p>Music from Kevin MacLeod's excellent collection - http://incompetech.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98f/98ffe403db6f43d9dba74fd202944b3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Mike Enoch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
