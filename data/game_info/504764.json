This painting tool had to contain 3D primitives (they also had to be destroyed afterwards) and a basic user interface. The user interface that I created allows the user to control the size of the primitive, the color(s) of the primitive, the distance the primitive can be away from the camera, and the type of primitive that is displayed. I used Unity, Visual Studios (C#), the YouTube lectures and lab times to complete the project.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:26:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1a/f1a55a4583ed3a0c75314d8d1be44861.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shanad22"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
