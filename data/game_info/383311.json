Should they be added, I will add the option to play without them as well.</p>\n<p>[NOTICE] I only have a Vive so have not tested the Oculus controller input. But have added alternate ways of moving forward. Try using the left trigger!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T05:13:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78f644b4ca1e48588be4696f47cb0943.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScaryCamelEntertainment"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
