Together with other warriors and heroes, you will begin a journey through a world full of monsters, villains, and challenges.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Over the course of your journey, you will learn not just about the world of Vana, but about yourselves and the destiny that awaits you... \u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Exemplar is the first game I've made using the RPG maker software. \u00a0</p>\n<p>This demo contains a combination of custom art assets and\u00a0RPG maker's RTP,\u00a0 including face art made in\u00a0the in-built character creator and some of the RTP tileset assets. The sound effects and animations are the RTP, but there\u00a0<em>is</em> completely original music, however.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This demo may contain bugs, glitches, typos and other issues that plague one-person projects: I'm aware of some of them and tried to fix any I could, but feel free to let me know about them anyway as you discover them.<br/></p>\n<p>The story is not yet complete! What is contained within is a solid chunk of storytelling, but it is not the complete story by any stretch. Currently, the game has only one nearly-complete country to explore - the country of Albion - that has cities, towns, characters and quests for you to experience. There are, however, at least three other major countries to be completed, which will be worked on as the game's development cycle progresses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Future iterations of this game will hopefully include completely customised tilesets, sounds, animation and more, as well as\u00a0custom face art replacing the RTP artwork, and the aforementioned extra countries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feedback, comments, and constructive criticism are highly encouraged! Future iterations will - depending on feedback - be updates to this demo or a separate, fuller release.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T07:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/746/746cdcde23020e0d581cf8692a447ada.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JedTERhodes"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
