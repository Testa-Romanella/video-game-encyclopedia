At any rate, the game was designed around a 16:9 aspect ratio, so I&#39;d reccommend against putting it into fullscreen for the best experience. <br />\n--Ryan--</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-07T21:50:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/118/118b1f5ba5597007354e55aa78e98888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Stone Monkey Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
