She believes the past will welcome her but in reality, it hits her rather strongly and she learns things she never would have imagined were possible.</p>\n<p>This demo was created in a months' time for NaNoReNo 2018, and shows only a short prologue to the game. It will be in constant development, and if there will be audience for it, I will work on having HD original assets and all the little details I imagined would fit the project.</p>\n<p>Music was done by the talented ejtmusic:</p>\n<p>http://www.ejtanmusic.com<br/></p>\n<p>Script writing &amp; Coding were done by:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/AngeladeFrost_<br/></p>\n<p>For NaNoReNo, graphic assets were taken from:</p>\n<p>Uncle Mugen (backgrounds):</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/unclemugen<br/></p>\n<p>Red-chan (Beth sprite):\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://red-baby.itc<br/></p>\n<p>Kyu-Kyu-Nya (female sprites):</p>\n<p>http://kyu-kyu-nya.tumblr.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Lady of Gatsby (male sprites):</p>\n<p>https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27326<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/695/695ce1fe02489dbc333e0a4598b59757.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cookie Codes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
