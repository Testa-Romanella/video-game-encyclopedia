You get the idea (from the video). Thanks.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You control Guenter, the yeti hunter on an expedition to defeat the yeti who has been throwing snowballs at everyone. You have long arms, with which you can grab onto the rocks and propell yourself  forward. You can hit the yeti by hitting him with your body. Beware of snowballs!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>* The sticks move your hands<br/></p>\n<p>* To grab with either hand, use the corresponding L2, R2 button</p>\n<p>* To propel yoursel, grab onto the rocks, pull the stick in the other way, and let go of the holding hand.</p>\n<p>How it fits the theme: Guenter climbs with his two separate hands. Unlike in most similar titles where you have only one rope or something similar.<br/></p>\n<p>! Game controller needed !<br/></p>\n<p>Sorry, I could not remove the authentication banner, also you may experience that the character is unable to jump, that's usually due to low framerate. I am afraid you have to use a controller for this to work. Also for some reason the web version has double music. Sorry.<br/>Thanks for playing the game! Have fun!</p>\n<p>PS: Please rate the game <br/></p>\n\r\n\r\nContains music \u00a92021 Joshua McLean (https://joshua-mclean.itch.io) Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T09:19:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/93338bdbd0de00a05753bcba24b1887c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["HackerHenry"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
