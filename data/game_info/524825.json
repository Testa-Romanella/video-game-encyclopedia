On his journey through space, the tiny astronaut has almost run out of fuel. And he seems a little lost...\u00a0Help him find his way back home! Land on planets, gather all star-fuel tanks, and try to get the shortest path with the least amount of moves for extra stars!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Tap tiles to rotate them.\u00a0</li><li>Create a path between the rocket and all fuel tanks.</li><li>Tap the Rocket to collect and launch!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Available for Android devices:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Only available on Google Play right now. Spend a bit of time making a WebGL build, but there were just\u00a0too many things to change to make it work properly.\u00a0Sorry for the inconvenience!</p>\n<p><strong>History:</strong></p>\n<p>A very early version of this game was created during a week-long gamejam in Utrecht. After some twists and turns and\u00a0a long time, this is a version created as a single developer to learn and to actually publish a project. Things didn't work well enough with a publisher, so it's just an ads-free puzzle game. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Developer -\u00a0Bas Hoogeboom</li><li>Special thanks - Nick Post,\u00a0Andrey Obolenskiy, Julia Kivenko</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T03:24:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a4/6a4e518461116facd1cc2124ccc5d1d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bas_Hoogeboom"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
