It\u2019s not quite the same as hanging out with them in person but, with the quarantine and everything going on, it\u2019s just nice to hear from them. As the night goes on though, you all find yourselves discussing things that ask a lot more from you than normal...but, tbh, nothing about the world feels normal right now\u2026so perhaps unmuting your mic and talking was a good idea.</em></p>\n<p>Unmuted is a cooperative conversation-starting game centered around playing online games with your friends and discussing\u00a0the isolation we've faced while being trapped in quarantine during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/></p>\n<p>In the game, players move back and forth between two phases, one of which involves getting comfortable with each other by playing a\u00a0\"20-questions\" style guessing game <em>to\u00a0prove that your team can communicate effectively and squash the competition!\u00a0</em>After a quick round, players gain points move to the second phase where,\u00a0<em>while waiting for matchmaking,</em> they ask each other questions about their experience in\u00a0quarantine\u00a0and gain bonus points by stepping up and adding to the conversation.\u00a0 As the game goes on, the questions players have to ask each other gradually become more intimate. After the final questions have been asked, the players have to say goodbye and\u00a0<em>Leave the Lobby</em> by writing goodbye messages and reading them allowed to each other. The catch here<em>\u00a0</em>is that these messages can only have as many words as they have points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that's Unmuted, a game about trying to say as much as we can in\u00a0the little time we have to hang out digitally and\u00a0play games with each other these days... in the little words we have left to send\u00a0through our mics and to each other.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T08:22:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00c81deb993ea444be7f97ff95a65b25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathann Latimore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
