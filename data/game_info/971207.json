If you\u2019re looking for hours of gameplay, deep narrative design and highly-polished features, PETE might not be for you. There is stuff to do, however! Resource gathering, outpost building, basic factory automation and even some rudimentary mission content, with increasingly more elaborate systems to play around with as developers add more robust content to the sandbox. Build stuff, break things, offer your feedback. WE WANT THAT FEEDBACK!<br/><br/>Yes, there will be bugs, broken features, confusing UI and the usual rigamarole you\u2019ll find in early testing, but you\u2019ll also experience the satisfaction of helping squish them bugs, build neat stuff, refine UI and have some fun along the way. Fun is the best! <br/><br/>To stay updated on the latest Project Existence Testing Environment news, check out the frequently updated Steam dev blog.
