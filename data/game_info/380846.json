All the game contents made in spare time, such as the action level AI, are designed by ourselves. Because the first game is inexperienced, if you have good ideas, please leave a message. We will listen to your opinions patiently. Because I am still in school, the production time is very limited. There will be a series of second games being planned. We will try our best to optimize our technology and make efforts to show you better art products.</h3><h3>Because the production time is insufficient, the Apocalypse only realizes the following ways of playing the second game, which is being improved and innovated on this basis.</h3><h3>1. At present, only one main weapon and one by-weapon program are supported, and their creation and perfection are carried out from the perspective of game feel.</h3><h3>2. support for automatic machine guns and helicopter weapons.</h3><h3>3. Simple task system interacts with AI</h3><h3>4. Supporting Multi-Person Operations</h3><h3>5. now there are 7 forms of zombies, namely giant screeers. These two kinds of attacks will cause players to fall down. There are also zombies who are crawling out of the ground, zombies sitting on zombies, zombies who eat zombies and ordinary zombies.</h3><h3>6. Implement a simple backpack system to replenish ammunition and bags.</h3><h3>Note: RJ-45 broadband networking is as follows</h3><h3>1.Open the game on the server and click \"Create Team\"</h3><h3>2.Open the game on the client and click \"Join the Team\" - \"Search\" - \"Join\"</h3><h3>Note: WIFI or Hot Spot Networking is as follows</h3><h3>1.Looking at the IP of the machine as a server through the Ipconfig of CMD must be the IPv4 address under WALN (CMD callout mode is Win+R)</h3><br/><br/><h3>2.Open the game on the server computer and click \u201cCreate Team\u201d.</h3><h3>3.Open the game on the client side and use the ~key (above the Tab key) to pull out the console, enter the open IP address and return to join the game (127.0.0.1 instead here).</h3><h3>4.Because the studio server is located in a special organization, it has not yet done domain name resolution.
