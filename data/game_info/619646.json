Use right MB to switch between players and freeze the inactive player in place so you can use him as a handy hook point. Jump about and release the rope with SPACE.</p>\n\n<p>Made in about 12 hours that I was able to find over the course of the weekend. First jam, first 'finished' and published game. I'm just here for the inspiration and the push to get something done. Coming back to this one though, I think there might be something here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:36:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5b/f5b36f0cafb327fd5839ace6da94fbc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UnbanBraids"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
