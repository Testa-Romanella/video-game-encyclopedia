It was made using (Mostly) original assets\u00a0(The tile sets are from the program itself.)\r\n</p>\n<p>It was made as a \"Proof-Of-Concept\", to get a feel for the mechanics and interactions between characters.\r\n</p>\n<p>\"The Adora Project / Side: Hugo\" is a story-based demo that follows Hugo Muramasa and his companions through a not-so normal day of school at Yosada High. This demo was made with the intent to show off what to expect from the main game, and to gather feedback for the future. The plot of the demo is canon, and worth playing even after the main game's release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T02:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b69/b69a1642091226062e04183005000e3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamDU"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
