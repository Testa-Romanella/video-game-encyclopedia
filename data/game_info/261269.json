Endless hypnotic and beautiful behaviours emerge from the simplest of physical laws.<br/><br/>Psyia is a custom GPU-accelerated physics system. Enter the StarLab and become a rainbow wizard (or witch), casting innumerable multicoloured particles around a void. The world pulses and morphs in time with the music and every detail of the simulation is tweakable to your exact tastes.<br/><br/>Or, for something more relaxing, enter Meditation mode, with support for laying, floor-sit, chair-sit or standing modes. Put your controllers down and watch as the particles dance and flow the meditation crystals, a peaceful and never-repeating ambient soundtrack of chimes guide you inwards.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li> GPU-powered physics-controller particle system with hundreds of thousands of particles possible on VR minimum-spec PCs<br/></li><li> Audio-reactive: automatically picks up the audio playing from your PC (so works with Spotify, YouTube, etc)<br/></li><li> Includes the album 'Escape the Tangle' by ColorPulse by default<br/></li><li> StarLab Mode, where you can customise tons of options creating almost anything you can imagine<br/></li><li> Meditation Mode, where you can lay back on some pillows and just watch the patterns emerge</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26e/26e211b32a993974196330e64c939ece.jpg", "website": "http://www.omnipudding.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lachlan Sleight"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Lachlan Sleight"], "esrb_rating": null}
