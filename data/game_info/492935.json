Play as Chablis, the party-pooping cat who, after suffering from a derailed delivery, wants nothing more than revenge on the neighboring bunnies who are seemingly at guilt. Using an arsenal of explosive carrots to destroy obstacles and lure bunnies to their demise, you\u2019ll make your way to the bunny boss, only to do nothing more than dispatch a dynamite delivery.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Are you a fan of games like Ratchet and Clank or Super Mario 64? Then this game is for you. Our target audience is the player who likes platformers, loves color, and doesn\u2019t mind hearing a good fart joke every few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>The game is currently available for all computers running macOS 10.13.1 or higher. In addition to standard WASD controls, players can also use a wireless DualShock 4 controller.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T14:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07c/07c848e71445927999d729c5e2cab973.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Minivan Arts"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
