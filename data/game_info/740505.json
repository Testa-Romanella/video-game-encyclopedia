Instead of creating another space adventure game, I want to do something that fits more with my current life status. In this game, the player can throw away all the pressure by using the power of the sun to kill it. The main character is controlling a Sunny Doll to shoot out bullet sun to kill all those unhappy and pressure's symbols from the life.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T07:46:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd0/dd0c902c0b112b3966992121c575ef33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Peilin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
