Filled with spiderwebs and old stuffs. My head hurts I can't seem remember anything. Who am I? Why I'm here? As I proceed to wonder around the room, I saw a piece of paper, flashlight and a camera on a table. \"Allen\" is written in the paper. I decided that I will use that name for a while until I remember who am I. As I walk in the room I suddenly felt a chill run down my spine. I hear eerie sounds, my instinct is telling me something bad will happen if I show myself. I hide behind the bed then peek. I can't see anyone but I can see something like a red orb floating? I can still hear the eerie sounds. Maybe my eyes is still adjusting in the dark so that's why I can't see it clearly. I decided to use the camera to see it. To my surprise, I saw an inhuman entity floating. Its eyes is glowing red seems its finding something or someone. I hide quickly, then cover my mouth with my hands. I nearly scream, I was so scared my hands are trembling. I need to get out of this place.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a game me and my friends\u00a0made in 2nd Year of Game Developing<br/>Alt + F4 to exit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:31:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84c/84ca228d248002c512375d40635e0140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gazuku"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
