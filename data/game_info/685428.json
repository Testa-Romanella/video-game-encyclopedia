{"id": 685428, "slug": "festival-of-wax-chapter-i", "name": "Festival of Wax: Chapter I", "name_original": "Festival of Wax: Chapter I", "description": "<p>Festival of Wax is a five-part Twine game that grew out of a fiction project I designed several years ago, because I was compelled by dark and malevolent forces outside of my control (and also some friends).</p>\n<p>It's a number of little second-person Horror vignettes, strung together with a candle-wick of continuity. Each chapter will take about 15 minutes or a touch more, depending on how quickly you read, with the whole thing likely totaling a bit over an hour. Things get weird fast: this originally took the form of a series of blog posts with polls and tarot-card readings that determined the plot. People made some... choices. <br/><br/>This is the result of those readings and decisions.<br/><br/>Festival of Wax isn't violent and it isn't disturbing, but it is very, very strange.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Now, because I do as the spirits command, it exists as a spooky internet book. Pick your favourite spooky music and dive in:\u00a0the longest Hallowe'en of your life is only getting started &lt;3</p>\n\n\n<p>cw: claustrophobia, light body horror, thalassophobia and eventually a number of other textbook PG-13 fears. Suitable for anyone reading in the dark, preferably before October 31st. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T06:39:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/745/745d1cd76497fd7986a5ac02a39821e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["popculturedeathdrive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
