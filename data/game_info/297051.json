And I\u2019m particularly inclined to agree with such affirmation. For good or bad, love is actually very blind, indeed. It is good when you still love someone who has some flaws that you can just ignore because it won\u2019t be a problem at all. But it\u2019s bad as hell once these flaws turn your relationship into a toxic environment and your mind and body suffer because of someone who\u2019s a monster - and you feel like you\u2019re guilty. But you repeat to yourself tirelessly that is love and that everything\u2019s gonna be ok. So, yeah, for the sake of good and bad things, love is blind.</p>\n<p>And this is why I\u2019m here. Cause my blindness didn\u2019t spare me of the suffering during these years of the so-called \u201clove\u201d. That\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m looking for your help. So I can become myself again.</p>\n<p>If I could define my current love life\u2026 Well, I\u2019d say I\u2019m sick of it\u2026 Or as I ironically like to think\u2026</p>\n<p>I\u2019m lovesick.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Credits:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Game Design: Jo\u00e3o Rabello\u00a0@ProgramaJao and Davi Bretas\u00a0@DaviiBSantos</p>\n<p>Programmer: Jo\u00e3o Rabello</p>\n<p>Visual artist: Jo\u00e3o Rabello</p>\n<p>Music and SFX: Davi Bretas</p>\n<p>Voice acting and SFX: Ver\u00f4nica Leal</p>\n<p>Storywriting: Davi Bretas</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong>:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Mouse left Button - Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:11:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb2b9e4d035e693677bc1137c50b4c8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CosmoJao", "Davi Bretas"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
