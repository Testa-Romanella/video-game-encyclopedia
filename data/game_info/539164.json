The goal is to line up variables in a specific way and \"execute\" them.<br/><br/>Objective and gameplay:<br/>Every level has an \"ACE Block\" that acts as the goal of each stage. Once anything comes into contact with it, gameplay will come to a halt and compare the variables with the objectives.</p>\n<p>Move the character with WASD and spacebar.</p>\n<p>Hover the mouse over the variables to see exactly what they are, and the number below them is the goal.<br/><br/>You can pick up and throw blocks by holding shift. When letting go of shift, you kick a block. You can aim where you kick by holding W or S.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for Discord Jam 5.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 10 levels in the game:\u00a0(in case you're wondering how close you are to completing the game)<br/>\u2022Smack the ACE Block!<br/>\u2022Around the wall<br/>\u2022Over the wall<br/>\u2022Juggling<br/>\u2022Hexadecimal<br/>\u2022Volcano<br/>\u2022Alien Invasion<br/>\u2022Momentum Mori<br/>\u2022Whale of a time<br/>\u2022Multireference<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>This is a puzzle game!
