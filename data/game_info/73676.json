Usually in sandbox games you have a real-time generated world and characters with bad texture quality (pixels), but EarthCraft stands out from other games. It has improved graphic and more realistic models (more vertexes).<br/>    There are many formations and biomes in the universe of the EarthCraft. You can find villages and caves, enemies and animals, water and lava. Sometimes you can see snow, rain or even lightning.<br/>    You can build giant cities and small towns using many different resources. You can find some of them on and under the ground dig and pick up anything you find into your inventory. There are many items you can craft or buy with coins in the store, such as pickaxes, swords and bows. This way you will save more time to build and discover the world. We made skins for both characters, so you can choose which one to wear today.<br/>    The game offers two modes \u2013 Survival and Creative.<br/>Creative: In this mode you focus on building beautiful constructions, you have all the items and resources in the inventory, it\u2019s the world of possibilities. The only thing that restricts you is your own imagination. <br/>Survival: In this mode you have to find food, craft weapons and armor to stay alive against enemies and to gather building blocks to construct shelters or houses. <br/>    You can switch between these worlds. It is possible to change the type of the world from Survive to Creative, if you don\u2019t want to fight against enemies and your passion is creating and building. If you found all items in the Creative mode and feel like fighting against enemies, you can change the type of the world into Survive to use all the knowledge you\u2019ve got. <br/> Create your own story in a realistic world of EarthCraft and have fun", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fd/4fdfbdec76f80690cca0fa3206c74442.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Survival, Explore and Craft Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Survival, Explore and Craft Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
