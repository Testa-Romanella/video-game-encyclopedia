Well, that's what it means in Ephemeral - a game inspired by a rocky and complicated relationship.</p><p>Ephemeral first came to be earlier this year as members of the indie game dev studio 5\u00bc Games worked together at the 2015 edition of the Global Game Jam. Brainstorming the theme of the jam (\"What do we do now?\") led the group to develop a complex narrative around two epicene entities with opposing personalities. Ephemeral, an abstract game about relationships, was awarded the title of 'Most Unusual Game' by the judges, and also placed 3rd in the popular vote.</p><p>Today, Ephemeral is available completely for free, with no in game purchases (we kid you not!). Aiming to portray our lives as a video game to which no manual exists, 5\u00bc Games wants you to stumble blindly through the characters' lives, learning the game mechanics as you go along.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ea/2ea091beca93a14137b406840eda3911.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["5andaquarter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
