Every other ghost who shares eternity here with you is trying to kill him, and you only wish to help him escape.</p>\n<p>This platformer was created for the Make-A-Level Leap Day 2020 Game Jam. My main goal for this project was to try to make every asset, from sprites to scripts, on my own. I did watch a few tutorials for things I have never done before, but I am happy with my end result.
