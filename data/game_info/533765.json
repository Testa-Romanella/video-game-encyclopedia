Playing online via peer2peer connection may requires for you to open a port on your router for the system you want to host the match on. The standart port for the game is 8190 but any port can be specified when hosting.</p>\n<p> Feel the vibes of your newly purchased, highly advanced OS and use its specialized  \"Hacking\"-Software to attack those pesky ports of your friends and manage those handy RAMS to protect your own.

If you want to play via the Internet you may need to specify an open port through which to play when connecting or you need to open the default port used by the game in your router settings. The default for the game is 8190\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>STEP BY STEP GUIDE</strong>:</p>\n<p>Connecting with another player:\r\n<strong>Host</strong>:</p>\n<p>-Open console</p>\n<p>-type \"host [your ip address or 127.0.0.1 if hosting locally] [a port if you want a specific one]\"</p>\n<p><strong>Client</strong>:</p>\n<p>-open console</p>\n<p>-type \"join [the host's ip] [the port the host specified]\"</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>:</p>\n<p>-upper left corner shows your health. If that number reaches 0 your system will crash (you loose)</p>\n<p>-to attack your opponent, start one of the \"hacking\"-games on your desktop. Each game will attack over a different port. The game \"AdSpam\" will just spam your opponent's desktop with ads. the faster you solve the Hacking-Games the more damage they will send.</p>\n<p>-each program will use up a certain amount of RAM. You only have 16MB Ram totally. If they are all allocated you have to close programs first before you can start new ones.</p>\n<p>-to protect yourself from incoming attacks you can allocate up to 8MB to different Port-Protectors in the Firewall Window. For each MB 4 damage points are blocked for that port.</p>\n<p>-you can get an idea what damage-type to expect from your enemy by opening the program \"HackRadar\". The more MB RAM you give the Hackradar, the more acurately it will display on which port a attack is coming, so you can manage your firewall accordingly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T09:00:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/434cb8e6083d5bb43c73c84137542328.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Popcornmotte"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
