The goal is to try to get the highest score!<br/>There's also a simple set of challenges included with the game to get you started and interested if you need bite sized goals set by the developer (me).<br/>After that it's entirely on you, the player, to make your own goal of making a high score in the default mode, or to beat the challenge list as fast as possible, etc.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>10 hand-crafted challenges.<br/></li><li>A singular ship.<br/></li><li>Ability to rotate on all 6 axes.<br/></li><li>Combos.<br/></li><li>Score modifier pickupables.<br/></li><li>Dragon curve fractal skybox.</li></ul><br/>Lastly, this game was written entirely from scratch.
