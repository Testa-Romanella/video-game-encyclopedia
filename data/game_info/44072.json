Taking on the role as the worlds smallest guardian, you will learn to survive, and re-conquer the lands you once called yours, from the unforgiving forces beyond your planet, but your not alone. Alongside with you, you will be acquainted with a friend, capable to control the elements in your immediate surroundings. Together, with your living form, and the spirits ability to control the elements, you will learn to re-take the world from what was once yours.<br/><br/>The game features the following:<br/><ul><li> An interactive menu capable of controlling your's and your spirits powers, with the simple touch of a button. Navigating through the elements you wish to control and choosing what you feel would be most helpful in the determined situation of you're choosing.<br/></li><li> An adventurous and interactive, living, breathing world free for the taking.<br/></li><li> A simple, yet satisfying fight system, repayable at the core, meant to increase the replay ability and purposely exploitable to help gather further experience before continuing to harder areas.<br/></li><li> and much more (admittingly due to the fact, I'm not quite sure if all the pending features I wish to add will work or even mix together)</li></ul><br/>Darkness and a Crowd is meant to take on the role of a side scroller RPG experience, done like never before. The most common RPG's are made in a top down environment easily accessible in simple, cheap programs like RPG Maker. What I want to bring to the table is a never before seen play style incorporating several ideas that have never been mixed and matched before.<br/>This truly is a once in a life time experience, and an idea that's never been played with before.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e87422177b24ebe065858748f906c62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Seth Albertus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Seth Albertus"], "esrb_rating": null}
