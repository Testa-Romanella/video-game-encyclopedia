So make sure to check them out before playing this mod, because you'll see familiar faces. All right onto story!</p>\n<p>Story: While Baldi was sleeping , the Pear stole his documents about owning the school. Now Baldi's school is under control of Pear. In school there is special \"Anti-Baldi\" security system so Baldi can't steal the documents. But the school is still running and Pear's letting in normal students. YOU as Baldi's student and good friend have to infiltrate the school pretending to be a normal student and steal all of the 7 notebooks and bring them back to Baldi.</p>\n<p>This is my first mod and maybe the last, because making it was fun but there were some pretty hard stressful moments so I probably won't make anymore mods. I am already doing cool animations and becoming a game developer doesn't really seem interesting to me, but i had a lot of fun making this mod so I hope you like it :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T11:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92dfd7d1171fd35c4b2267aefbc65c64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nabaldazhnik Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
