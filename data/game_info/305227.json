Yup, that's about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls are explained in-game. You only need a mouse.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I will probably not do anything more with it, but the 4 unpolished levels of the game show different kind of level types I would have gone for if I did a bigger game. I also planned on making an \"exploration\" level, but in the end I considered I had already spent enough time on this project.</p><p>Apologies for the ball sometimes jumping, looks like Unreal can't have perfectly flat grounds or I just didn't find how to correct this.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T03:08:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/913/91374e33256efb89478a54799f989527.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChronoDream"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
