Traveler's Bazaar is popular amongst adventurers, but there's just one problem-You're the only employee! Make sure to bag the correct amount of items in a timely manner!</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Up to three travelers will show up at the stall with an order. Each traveler will tell you the type and amount of items needed to complete their order. You are in charge of packing bags with the requested\u00a0items to help these adventurers\u00a0on their journeys.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To pack an item, click on its corresponding basket and drag and drop the item to the backpack closest to the traveler. Once you finish packing, click on the backpack to send the traveler on their way.</p>\n<p>If you pack correctly, you gain one point. If not, you will lose a life.</p>\n<p>Travelers will get impatient based on how many items they ask for. The less items requested, the less patient they will be.\u00a0If they get too impatient, they will leave and you will lose a life.</p>\n<p>To help pack\u00a0bags, there is\u00a0brown plank\u00a0that you can drag around. Items can slide down the plank into the backpacks. Right-click the plank to change its direction.</p><p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p><p>Ryan Chu\u00a0- Programmer</p><p>Hannah Feder - 2D Art</p><p>Kylie Sussman - 3D Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T04:10:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/067/06785638a02a3e32d16aa6dcb7150c2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rychuz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
