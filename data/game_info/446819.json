There are goats in the branches that that the player must avoid. If one player touches a goat, both players restart. The time stops when both players reach their respective goal.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to see which team of players can complete this course the fastest.</p>\n<p>This game is in prototype stage and has a fair share of bugs. We did it more as a learning project and it was great fun. Thank you to the TO Jam organizers for putting on the jam virtually.</p>\n<p>This game was created by Jeffrey Wong (programmer) and Gloria Bwalya (graphics).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T08:06:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f54e64d96dee1e4d413f2016039b1d52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gjteam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
