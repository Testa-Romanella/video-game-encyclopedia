Implementing a \"help your grandma to use a computer over the phone\" set of nerves with a unusual command system of CLICK, OPEN, COPY and PASTE, this game brings a refreshing twist to a forgotten genre. Your mission will be to guide the agent over a complex web of root directories, folders and files and help him to copy and paste what he needs. At the same time you will experience the contents of the villains computer. Maybe we aren't so different after all? The game will bring you to tears with its wittiness and humour, which in combination with the two endings of the game will certainly encourage you to play it multiple times. Writing MEMORY will show the files you have copied, and you can turn the music on and off with MUSIC ON or MUSIC OFF. To quit the game write EXIT or QUIT.</p>\n\n<p>*music: Silly Detective by Joe Alfaraby</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T15:43:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5f/a5ff3a791a839f766f3d1dd3a5d7b5c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sdad_711"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
