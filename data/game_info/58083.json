Content can be downloaded from GOG.com when available.\n<br/><br/>\nSurviving Mars is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day\u2019s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Season Pass will add two full expansions and two content packs to Surviving Mars in the months following launch.\n<br/><br/>\nSave with the Season Pass and never miss a single addition -- each one is yours to download as soon as it arrives.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T20:58:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba7/ba751f8dcafb73eaf1916a4d389b4269.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 382, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Haemimont Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Paradox Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
