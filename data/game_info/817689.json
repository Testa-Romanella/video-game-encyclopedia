In this game you control the Egregore, a galactical hive mind with the goal of assimilating the entire galaxy. You can use planets under your control to take control over new planets that will surely be glad to join Egregore.</p>\n<p>But beware, another hive mind is lurking in the shadows and will try to claim planets and even attack your planets. This won't stand! You must eliminate this opponent and unite the galaxy as Egregore.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made over the course of 7 weeks as part of our semester project in a game design and development course at Mentor college in Israel.</p>\n<p>We had a great time working on many aspects of the project, from game design and pixel art to programming and building the enemy AI.
