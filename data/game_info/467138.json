The only \"weapon\" the main character has, is his ability to transfer his mind to another creature, but when he does that, his own body gets \"out-of-control\", potentially running right to the enemy. And, also, the enemies are mutant rabbits, which are definetly out-of-control.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>You can play in the browser or donwload the (zipped)\u00a0windows version.</strong></p>\n<p>The game was made with Unity. All art (if you can call it that), code and audio made by us over the weekend 11-12 July 2020. You play with WASD for movement, transfer your mind to a rabbit by clicking on it, get back to your body with left click,\u00a0see and put away the map with \"M\" and skip text messages with a mouse click.</p>\n<p><strong>The story</strong><br/></p>\n<p>When my local school got taken over by a bunch of mutant rabbits from a failed experiment at the nearby secret government lab, I thought they would just send the army to eradicate them. But then the protests began. \"Don't kill the rabbits,\" they said, \"they are so cute!!!\" So now it's up to me to save the headmistress, the only human left in the school, from the rabbits who are after her \"knowledge\".\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why me, you ask? Am I a secret spy specially trained for that kind of mission?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not at all. I'm a university professor who invented a formula that gives me a very special ability: I can transfer my mind to another living creature. My hope is that I can use this to get pass the rabbits and save the headmistress (I kind of like her). The only problem is that while my mind is in someone else's body, my body gets completely out of control.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b3dde0f515da32699a5b4d769cf1f6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Hairy Game Dev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
