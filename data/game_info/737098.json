In this game players play as a regular person named Kaji whose city is under attack by giant Kaiju monsters. Kaji must run away from them while avoiding obstacles or face certain doom!</p>\n<p>See how long you can run and how many coins you can earn! Play again and again, endlessly!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made by Arissa Adams</p>\n<p>Check out my portfolio at kaijugames.xyz</p>\n\n\n<p>***DESIGNER NOTES***</p>\n<p>There is a bug involving the Main HUD displaying on all screens. You will see the distance counter actively counting the characters movement from the very start of the game. I didn't get time to fix this before the Jam ended. The counter will reset when you load into the actual level so it will not affect your final score.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T07:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a15/a15b2239c7620a63f3c2351878130015.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KaijuGames.xyz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
