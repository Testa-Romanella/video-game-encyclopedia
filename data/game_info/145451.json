I decided to start with something easy and this was as easy as it could get. It is officially the first game I ever made (and completed). The controls are simple: you left-click or press spacebar to make the Whale swim. The only sound in the game is that of water. It may be hard to hear. It isn't very polished or professionally made but it is the best I could manage. Hey! It's my first game...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c90/c90836f55cbb0ed9d7d690b115701f83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Endeth"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
