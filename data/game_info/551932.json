{"id": 551932, "slug": "coined", "name": "Coined", "name_original": "Coined", "description": "<p>Phillip Phillipson is an amateur treasure hunter who wants to venture into a cave to find treasure.\u00a0 He finds treasure but, it is extremely heavy and slows his speed. You have to guide him through the caves, bats, goblins and traps to keep him alive!</p>\n<p>This game was made in 7 days for the Blackthornprod Game Jam 3. The theme was \"Less is More\", so I\u00a0came up with the idea that less coins gives you more speed. I spent a while on this game so I\u00a0would appreciate\u00a0a rating.</p>\n<p>Note - there is a bug with the pause menu where the \"Menu\" button won't work. To fix this, just click the menu button then resume the game and it should take you back to the menu.</p>\n<p>The font asset:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/fonts/free-pixel-font-thaleah-140059<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:54:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8af/8af267bb4ba7b914b58c284be8f12a08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Trumpet_Weasel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
