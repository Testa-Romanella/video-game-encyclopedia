Each player plays with tokens or \u2018bits\u2019 of either red and yellow or green and blue. The aim is to move your bits clockwise around the board and onto the respective final squares before your opponent does.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll need a 6 to get one of your bits out of the home squares and then you\u2019re free to move them around the board using one or both of the dice you roll. Each time you roll the dice, you must use both dice to move your bits if you can.<br/><br/>Important things to remember<br/><br/>If you roll a 6 then you get another go. Rolling a double also gets another go if you have that rule turned on in settings. However, rolling a double 6 does not get 2 extra goes.<br/><br/>In the event that progression is not possible with the resultant of both dice, then the value of the highest scoring dice is to be used, unless progression is blocked. If bits cannot be moved with the value of either die, then that's the end of your turn.<br/><br/>Hacking off<br/><br/>If your bit lands on a square with one of your opponent\u2019s bits on then you take (\u2018hack off\u2019) their bit and send it back home.<br/><br/>Blobbing up<br/><br/>If you get 2 bits of the same colour on one square (a \u2018blob\u2019) then your opponent cannot get past or hack off these bits. This is the best way to slow down your opponent and stop them getting round the board. However, if you have 2 or more bits of differing colours on one square then this is known as a mixi-blob. Your opponent can hack off all the bits in a mixi blob if one of their bits lands on that square and your opponent can pass these squares with impunity.<br/><br/>Sixing-Off<br/><br/>You can get your bits past a blob by landing one of your bits on the square immediately behind the blob and rolling a six on the first roll of your turn. You can then elect to \u2018six-off\u2019 the blob by tapping the \u20186\u2019 over the square in question. You\u2019ll need to roll a number of sixes in succession greater than the number of bits in the blob (plus one extra six if your bit needs to get out of home as well). This will then allow you to send your opponent\u2019s bits all back home whilst moving one of your bits forward onto the square.<br/><br/>Finishing<br/><br/>Once one of your bits gets towards the end of the board, when it is on those squares of its own colour, it is safe and cannot be hacked-off by your opponent.<br/><br/>The first player to get all their bits onto the final squares with an exact dice roll is the winner. If this is done before their opponent gets any bit round the board, it is known as an eight-piecing. If the winner gets all their bits in before their opponent has got any bits out into play then it is known as an eight piece in the pen.<br/><br/>Additional rules can be selected, happy Uckers playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T04:38:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc3/fc344a3957b954d9001e7cc9fd1556d7.jpg", "website": "https://playuckers.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Timothy Wills"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Timothy Wills"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
