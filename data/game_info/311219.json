{"id": 311219, "slug": "kelly-watch-the-stars", "name": "Kelly, Watch the Stars", "name_original": "Kelly, Watch the Stars", "description": "<p>Chill your way through space as you shoot asteroids, collect stars, and\u00a0score points\u00a0as much as possible.</p>\n<p>You control a lone spaceship as you search for stars within the night sky\u00a0to the eye of your significant other. You score points by shooting asteroids and collecting stars (which can be located by an arrow that points them out, which\u00a0pops up around ~1:30 ). The whole experience lasts about 4 minutes or so. Also green meteors show up, because why not? Dying is no big deal in this game, as it is designed to be a relaxing experience and can even be played one handed!</p>\n<p>This is meant to actually be a a \"beta\" version of a \"game-within-a-game\" I'm planning on making in the future (when I have the time). I figured, why not release this in the meantime?\u00a0I'm quite proud of it. It was actually originally made as a present for my girlfriend (her name is not Kelly), but this version is another version made more general to the public (my gf is the only one who gets the original, sorry guys)\u00a0. The title is the name of the song that plays as you play the game, \"Kelly Watch the Stars\" by french electronic duo Air.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>W+S to move forwards and backwards, A+D to turn left and right respectively.\u00a0<br/>Spacebar to shoot at asteroids.\u00a0<br/>While you collect stars you'll notice they follow you around. You may keep them to act a sort-of barrier to destroy asteroids as they come to you or launch them with left-Ctrl(for one handed mode) or a left mouse click, which will make them explode in a dark-hole-shockwave effect that'll damage anything caught within it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to download it of course or even just watch a playthrough and let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24ad7c3dc5bfc714ca55f60222ce0187.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TimbreGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
