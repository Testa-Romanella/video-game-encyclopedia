They would be able to see the back of their head no matter what direction they looked, and if they walked in any direction they would end up where they started. In this game you are placed in the surface of a four dimensional sphere in much the same way.</p>\n<p>What's really interesting is the optical effects of this space. Every point in this space has an opposite point, just like how every point on a sphere has an opposite point. When you stand near the space opposite an object it looks like it's right in front of you, even though it's almost as far away as possible. Then when you move into that space it appears to wrap around you.</p>\n<p>The gameplay at this point is just placing blocks like in Minecraft. The placement grid is based on a shape called the 600-cell.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: W A S D space shift</p>\n<p>Turn: mouse Q E</p>\n<p>Break / place blocks: left / right click</p>\n<p>Select material: 1 2 3 4 5</p>\n<p>Show grid: F1</p>\n<p>Change level: 0 - =</p>\n<p>Exit: esc\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:00:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f9/4f9483224e7fe077f190d8740ae2829f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["akriegman"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
