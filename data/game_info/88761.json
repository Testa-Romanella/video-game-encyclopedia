It reached #1 on many portals and stayed in RealArcade's Top 10 for an unprecedented 54 weeks. Gutterball 2 arrived in 2004 with all-new crazy bowling alley designs, much improved visuals and physics, and new features galore. And now, in 2011, Gutterball: Golden Pin Bowling is all-new and ready to go! We think it's the finest bowling game on the App Store and we've played them all. <br/><br/>You be the judge... is this Gutterball the best bowling game ever?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff326a82203fb85ea48bbbcb4a1a4337.jpg", "website": "http://www.skunkstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Skunk Studios"], "genres": ["Sports", "Family"], "publishers": ["Skunk Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
