This game includes several awesome features such as heat up gatling guns with shell casing ejection, rocket launchers with homing missiles, and slow motion to help fight off the assault. A local opponent player can use a PC controller to designate the destination of where asteroids come from and/or launch the mother-ship boss fight. This game is solely made by one person and made with attention to detail.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1ebe198b615eb46cddad98f26e0f145e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zachary Stafford"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zachary Stafford"], "esrb_rating": null}
