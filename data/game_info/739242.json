You can use wasd or arrow keys to move the ball. The goal is to get to the orange gate and pass all 4 levels. If the marble touches the blue obstacles, the level will restart. The same applies if the marble falls off the map. The first three level is mainly based off of moving around the obstacles and not falling of the map. The last level is a maze where you have to find the exit, aka the orange gate. Thanks for playing and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T08:45:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ced/ced243b64edfc35a40f5f8c6eb214fcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["grexzi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
