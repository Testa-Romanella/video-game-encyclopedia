{"id": 18701, "slug": "supreme-commander", "name": "Supreme Commander", "name_original": "Supreme Commander", "description": "<p>The game was created by the man who also created the game Total Annihilation and in many ways embodies the same approach to the games of this genre.<br />\nEarthlings have discovered the technology of instantaneous relocation to any other planet. This was the beginning of a process of large-scale colonization. Over time, the colonists wanted independence from earthlings, alien races were discovered, with which some earthlings entered into an alliance, while other earthmen learned symbiosis with artificial intelligence.<br />\nFinally, the Earth was destroyed, leaving in the universe several opposing &quot;races&quot;. And on every uninhabited planet, the struggle for resources can now unfold.<br />\nThe main resources are two, Matter and Energy. To use resources, it is often important not to have a stock, but to achieve the inflow of both resources in a certain amount per second.<br />\nThe new territory is thrown Supreme Commander - the key unit in the game. From it on the territory are distributed units with special functions.<br />\nThe game allows you to instantly &quot;take off&quot; over the entire territory and view it all. Another function is to divide the screen into two parts. Dividing the screen into two parts, you can work with each part in the same way as with the entire screen before the separation - increase or, conversely, view from the height.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2007-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-24T12:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac1670a3d55d603171224368cb8bed8.jpg", "website": "http://www.supremecommander.com/", "rating": 3.78, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 78, "owned": 1795, "beaten": 85, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 69, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 82, "ratings_count": 172, "suggestions_count": 557, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 173, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Gas Powered Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic"], "esrb_rating": null}
