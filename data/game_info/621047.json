Each thruster can boost up and down independently. The thrusters shoot bullets which you can use to destroy the enemies that spawn periodically.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I had less than a day to work on this since my weekend was pretty busy so there's no sound, music, title screen etc. Sorry! <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80f5a7a71a8a7165d439a6e94d5bf240.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Katsew"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
