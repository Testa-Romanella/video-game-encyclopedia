It was two years after the accident in Human Revolution, where augmented people started to act uncontrollable and aggressive. As it turns out, a rogue group called Illuminati made it look like a proof for their instability and now augmented people are living like outcasts. </p>\n<p>We follow Adam Jensen once again as he works as a double agent for Interpol and a hackers group called Juggernaut Collective to confront the Illuminati and reveal the truth.</p>\n<p>The core gameplay of Mankind Divided hasn&#39;t changed much except minor changes like no need for batteries anymore because your energy bar slowly regenerates itself back and a non-killing politic. You can beat the game without killing anyone making Mankind Divided a big morality question for the player as he walks it through.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2016-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T17:43:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/00d/00d374f12a3ab5f96c500a2cfa901e15.jpg", "website": "http://www.deusex.com/", "rating": 3.97, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 907, "owned": 6855, "beaten": 1313, "toplay": 396, "dropped": 548, "playing": 120}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 315, "ratings_count": 1953, "suggestions_count": 631, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 1973, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "Xbox One", "macOS", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Eidos Montreal"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Feral Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
