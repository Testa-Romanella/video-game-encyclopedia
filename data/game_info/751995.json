Having been described as full-motion video-based, it is presumed that it would train the employee in various scenarios at Burger King. Due to the fact that the two articles that make mention of the CD-i game as being in a testing state and not being rolled out until late 1997, it is unknown if the training game was ever sent out to any Burger King location.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-13T22:58:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/951/9511f0509bf74deb9a69f9c93159507c.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/burger-king-orientation-cd-i-training-philips-cd-i-usa/scans/jpegs/0%20-%20cover_front.jpg", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
