This game does not follow the exact same rules as the original Pong.

I might finish development some day, if there is a demand for it.<br/><br/></p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n\n<p>- 1 or 2 players<br/>- Keyboard and Gamepad compatible<br/>- 2 people can play using the same keyboard<br/><br/></p>\r\nRecommended specs:\r\n<p>- Windows 10<br/>- 8 GB RAM<br/>- CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo Series / AMD Athlon X4 870K<br/>- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 6 Series / AMD\u00a0Radeon HD 5830<br/>* note that it wasn't actually tested on such low specs but I assume it would work anyways</p>\r\nHow to launch the game:\r\n<p>- Unpack .zip archive<br/>- Launch Pong-Like_Game_Beta_0.6 executable</p>\r\nControls:\r\n\n<p><strong>P1:</strong><br/><strong>UP:</strong> Joystick Up / W<br/><strong>Down:</strong> Joystick Down / S<br/><strong>Pause:</strong> Start / Spacebar<br/><strong>Quit game:</strong> Alt+F4</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>P2:</strong><br/><strong>UP:</strong> Joystick Up / Arrow Up<br/><strong>Down:</strong> Joystick Down / Arrow Down<br/><strong>Pause:</strong> Start / Spacebar<br/><strong>Quit game:</strong> Alt+F4</p>\n\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n<p>- If the cursor does not seem to move on the Menu screen.
