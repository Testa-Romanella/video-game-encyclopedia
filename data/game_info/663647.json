We can\u2019t let them keep stealing our Radiance and turn our islands into a wasteland like below. \u201c\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<p>Tainted Radiance is a Rogue-like Real-time Strategy game. Control your small squad of units against groups of Steeler soldiers coming your way. Customize your units with different weapons, skills and upgrades. The game features 4 base unit types, 18 weapons that have 3 tiers, 8 skills and 76 upgrades.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is the prototype of our game that has been made for a year. We are moving on in our lives so this is the final state of the game and we decided to publish it for free. We won\u2019t work on it anymore except to fix major bugs.\r\n</p>\n<p>We hope you have fun in this uncommon mix of Rogue-like and Real-time Strategy. If you enjoyed our small game, feel free to give us a little tip and give us feedback about your experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>____\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tristan Charial </strong>- Programming and game design\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Philippe Cwik</strong> - Game design, level design and a bit of programming\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas Saulnier</strong> - Artist<br/><br/><strong>Alice Rameau </strong>- Artist<br/><br/><strong>Enzo Titarelli </strong>- Composer<br/><br/>That was your team : Sucre Discret<br/><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T08:40:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbe/fbec079ea810df7b5e25cd68a01882ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SucreDiscret"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
