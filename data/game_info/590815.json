There are 2 teams, red and white. And you are on the white team.</p>\n<p>This simulation is\u00a0<em>completely automated</em>\u00a0and you don't control any spaceships, but you can watch them compete in a war from 20 spaceships to\u00a0<strong>more than 200.</strong>\u00a0You choose how many spaceships each team has.\r\n</p>\n<p>Watch the actions as they fight, the further away a spaceship is from its target, the faster it becomes. There are bullets and bombs, and bombs make spaceships of the other team fly when they get hit by it! Also, the more spaceships there are on the other team, the faster the minority team shoots bullets, leading to an<strong>\u00a0intense</strong>\u00a0game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Currently this is an alpha prototype, it might have bugs.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T11:17:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb24ab3b80fb6ef0fd650ad6162b802e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SSMAX"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
