At the beginning of the run you know it, the map marks it for you, and with each hit of the enemies you lose a part of the map, the heroes exchange their attacks and abilities (each one has 2) to overcome the different rooms and arrive like this to find the final boss. If you reach the end of the run and don't meet the boss, you can repeat but a new run will be generated. I hope that the idea is understood a little since the final result I have not been able to polish it to the maximum.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you like it and enjoy the music and getting lost in the mazes.</p>\n<p>In the \"+ info\" section there is a panel with a small tutorial that indicates each type of controller and its controls, for PC you use \"Q,W,E\" for skills and \"R\" to change the set of attacks.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>-- Endorth --<br/></p>\n<p>Idea - Endorth</p>\n<p>Code - Endorth</p>\n<p>SFX - Endorth</p>\n<p>Characters - Endorth</p>\n<p>Music - Endorth</p>\n<p>Backgrounds - CraftPix (modified)</p>\n<p>Engine - Godot\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T08:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbf70b3faf56ea0970ea24f83c4fcddf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Endorth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
