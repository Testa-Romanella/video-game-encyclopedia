It's super basic, no UI or UX elements, just code. When some of my friends play tested it, it took about an hour on average to finish.</p>\n<p>To play just type commands and hit enter. (have to 'start' before you can do anything else, including exit)</p>\n<p><strong>!! Please remember to say 'exit game' if you are closing the game before you've won. This will ensure it clears the data properly. !!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A common bug</strong> - If commands don't seem to be working, all commands are two word entries, so if you do an odd amount of words (1 or 3 for example), it will get confused. So to fix, type 1 more word to even it back out.</p>\n<p>There are most likely typos and stuff, so please let me know if you notice anything wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Unzip file, may need to use 7zip which is what I used, and run the application in the main folder.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>To change text size -\u00a0</strong>Right click on the top of the application window, select properties, and then you can change the font size.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T15:34:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/0468271797d0fc248814f9140b1784e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CranberryDoom"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
