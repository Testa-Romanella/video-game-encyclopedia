Due to time constraints, I'm making the game available for download as a demo. It contains some bugs. I plan to remake it in the future with my own improved models, expanded story and better gameplay.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Attention:</strong> Don\u2019t play Haunted Room, if you are afraid of horror games or any kind of jumpscares . For the younger audience I recommend you stop watching this video immediately. This game is a kind of FPS horror survival adventure and escaperoom , I\u2019ve created with Unity 2019.3.4f1. For this game I\u2019ve spent two months to finished it. Actually, Haunted Room was just a project for the course Computer Games of my Master studies of Computer Science, but I\u2019ve decided to continue developing this game on my own. Haunted Room is based on my nightmares from my childhood. Gameplay: You woke up in an unknown dark house. You don\u2019t know where you are and how you ended up in this room . Although the fireplace is lightning you can\u2019t see absolutely nothing in this room by midnight. The only way to see is with the flashlight you\u2019ve got on you. But beware: The batteries of your flashlight have its limit. Just switch on the light if you need it, otherwise the batteries will die. When you have no options to turn on any light after one minute the Ghost of Darkness is coming to you and you\u2019d pay with your life. The main goal of the game is to escape from the spooky room. This might be dangerous . Solve puzzles in the darkness, try to stay alive and, most important\u2026 don\u2019t let you fool by your own fear. If you liked FNAF , you\u2019ll like HauntedRoom just as much.
