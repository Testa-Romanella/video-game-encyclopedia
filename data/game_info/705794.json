In the new game, called \"Save The Fruit!\", you play as a soldier fighting off an army of space bugs that are attempting to ruin your picnic by eating all your watermelon. You must destroy their queen to make them leave you and your picnic alone.</p><p>My modifications to the game include:</p><p>1. A custom soundtrack for each level, which helped to add to the emotional and player experience. Level one's soundtrack is upbeat and exciting, reflecting the experience of learning a new environment. The second level's soundtrack, on the other hand, incorporates high energy\u00a0elements of dubstep and electronic house, which puts the user on edge for the boss fight.\u00a0</p><p>2. Like I mentioned before, I also created two levels for the game. The first level serves as an intro, with doors and keys, and introductions to each type of enemy. Here, watermelon pieces litter the picnic table, as you escape from the picnic basket. The second level is the boss fight, with the alien bug mother melon gobbler queen atop a mountain of watermelon. After beating the boss, a portal appears and you may escape and win the game.</p><p>3. My final modification has also been previously alluded to in this post. I re-skinned the terrain, adding cloud, picnic table, watermelon flesh and watermelon rind textures. In addition to this, I created watermelon objects to fill the picnic baskets, and I resigned and reshaped the main menu background. to fit the theme.</p><p>As for the assets, I created the sounds using Apple's GarageBand, and also created the terrain textures. The rest of the assets were from MSU's CAS 117.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:07:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/890/890a4963dea9dd93da689fa8633f4466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gcbg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
