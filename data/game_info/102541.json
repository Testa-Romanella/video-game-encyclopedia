I do not know.  </p>\n<p><strong>Player Interaction</strong>: Click on civilizations to inspire them to reach for the stars. But beware if you interfere too much, a terrible event could be triggered.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals</strong>: Your choice. Do you want to help forming a galaxy with diverse civilizations? Do you want intelligent life to fade out until entropy takes over? Or should one species dominate the galaxy with a iron fist?</p>\n<p>I am working for a while on a narrative/strategy game about the Fermi Paradox. </p>\n<p>Then I heard about Fermi Jam and took a old prototype of the meta game and made it really fast. I had a lot of fun doing this and learned a lot about the original project. I hope you like it too. Any feedback, praise or comments would be appreciated a lot.
