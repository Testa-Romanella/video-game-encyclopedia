{"id": 415687, "slug": "logic-gates", "name": "Logic Gates", "name_original": "Logic Gates", "description": "<p>Requires: Windows XP or above.</p>\n<p>This is a remake of an old calculator game I made in secondary school. In this game, you try to guess the logic gate creating the outcome based on the inputs and outcomes. This game also references the Apple II.</p>\n<p>The original calculator game was my first and only calculator puzzle game. However, a bit of luck is involved. After talking with a friend, I added an \u201cAction Mode\u201d that seeks to capture the original spirit of the game as I intended and port it over to the Windows PC, without the limitations of the calculator. In that mode, there will not be unfair puzzles: You are tested on speed and will always be given all the info you need to solve the puzzle.</p>\n<p>I wrote an article for this game which you could read here (includes gate summary): https://tangent-ghwaang.fandom.com/wiki/Logic_Gates<br/></p>\n<p>A highlight, if you will, of this game is its user-friendliness. I tried to make the game as convenient as possible, without requiring the player to do much unnecessary work that would bother the player, such as manually erasing or re-entering the rough work sheet with every round, and having the wrong choices removed so as to prevent accidental double-clicking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7f1d100bbc6f0947539596948e030a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tangentg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
