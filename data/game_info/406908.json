However, exiting the screen will make you lose 10 points and you will no longer be able to shoot until you re-enter. This is the intentional bug for the theme.</p>\n<p>For each triangle (objective) you pick up, you gain 100 points.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks to Jonas for the Wowie Resource Pack! I used this pack for all of the sound effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T05:16:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78fc66a91aeeb6e067d4de9ef83eb9ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KJC13"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
