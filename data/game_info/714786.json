It shows colored segment based organisms that mutate and evolve in a 2D environment. Biogenesis is based on Primordial Life by Jason Spofford.</p>\n<p>Microscopic organisms can be plants , consumers, viruses, or they can combine these lifestyles. The simulation includes a genetic laboratory, where you can design or modify the organisms yourself.<br/></p>\n<p>The \"Color Mod\" is a semi-official expansion for Biogenesis by MarcoDBAA (= creator of this page and co-admin at sourceforge for Biogenesis), that adds 39 new colors (functions) to it (see first screenshot), and allows the organisms to react actively and intelligently (because of natural selection), when they touch (TEAL segment) or see (EYE segment) another organism. The colored segments can branch out, mutation rates can be individual, and there are many more changes.\u00a0You can read about them here:\u00a0https://sourceforge.net/projects/biogenesis/files/Color%20Mod/1.9/</p>\n<p>Download Biogenesis (completely free) at:\u00a0https://sourceforge.net/projects/biogenesis/\u00a0The main download includes Biogenesis 0.9 (vanilla), the \"Color Mod\", and the \"X Mod\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>Available ingame\u00a0languages: English, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, German, Russian</p>\n<p>User manual (vanilla Biogenesis) at:\u00a0http://biogenesis.sourceforge.net/<br/></p>\n<p>You may post at the\u00a0sourceforge discussion forum:\u00a0http://sourceforge.net/projects/biogenesis/forums</p>\n<p>You can use this subreddit:\u00a0https://old.reddit.com/r/BiogenesisGame/</p>\n<p>A Biogenesis user also created a discord server a while ago, and I am also active there:\u00a0https://discord.gg/EBCm9NGF8h\r\n</p>\n<p>Have fun! :)\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T04:49:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/439/439b924f91921f157494d336061060e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MarcoDBAA"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
