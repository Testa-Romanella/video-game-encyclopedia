IxI.G-Y, otherwise known by the nickname <strong>\u201cLittle Guy,\u201d</strong> was found to be disruptive in his place of work; rather than focusing on the tasks at hand, Little Guy would instead fold important documents into origami cranes, play with the lab animals, and build small contraptions out of random scrap found throughout the facility.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This is why he is here: one of TRI-AD CORPORATION\u2019s sprawling, state-of-the-art factories. He is scheduled to have a complete restart, and if he is still found to be defective after this process, he'll be deactivated and stripped down for parts\u2026\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Understanding this, Little Guy looks to<strong> escape the factory.</strong> Not only is the huge building against him, but various <strong>other robots found throughout!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 As Little Guy attacks the other robots, they'll drop parts! Pick these up to reinforce your body,\u00a0\u00a0boosting your defense and healing damage!</strong></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0To aid Little Guy through the TRI-AD Corp. factory, please use the following <strong>keyboard</strong> controls:\r\n</p>\n<p> <strong>W/S</strong> -Move Forward/Backwards\r\n</p>\n<p> <strong>A/D </strong>- Move Left/Right\r\n</p>\n<p> <strong>SPACE BAR</strong> - Jump\r\n</p>\n<p> <strong>MOUSE MOVEMENT</strong> - Aim\r\n</p>\n<p> <strong>LEFT CLICK</strong> - Fire\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>After defeating a boss, a teleportation pad will activate.</strong> When it does this, the factory allocates its energy to this pad from other places, so there will be a delay in how quickly it turns on. Please be patient and enjoy a word from TRI-AD CORP. as you wait! <strong>Once it is powered on, simply walk into it to head to the next area!</strong></p>\r\nTeam:\r\n<p>\t-Harry Jaeger: Producer, Gameplay Designer, 3D-Modeler, Concept Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>\t-Celeste Levy: 3D-Modeler, Music and Sound Effects, Concept Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>\t-James Eccles: Programming, Environment Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>\t-Nichole Hall: Narrative and Scriptwriter, Social Media\r\n</p>\n<p>\t-Hobo Roiland: Voice Actor, Artist</p>\n<p>-Sandro: Voice Actor, SFX editor</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T17:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31d1dc6755be6f03361774bab389b53e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["249Studios", "Celeste"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
