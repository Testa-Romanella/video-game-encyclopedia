The more cubes matched at a time, the more power the corresponding grid receives. Don't let any of the grids go offline, and watch out for falling power cubes.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- Left and right arrow keys to move<br/>- Space to jump<br/>- Space while in the air to throw held power cube at the ground<br/>- [Z] to pick up / swap highlighted cube<br/>- [X] to place cube on the ground</p>\n<p>Moving next to or standing on cubes will highlight them to be picked up, or swapped with the cube you currently have.
