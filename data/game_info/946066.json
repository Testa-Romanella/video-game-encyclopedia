Rapture was another theme we implemented with the attack on humanity.<br/></p>\n<p>Here is the credited random gen:\u00a0https://gunnar-clovis.itch.io/game-jam-theme-generator<br/></p>\n<p>My Iron Skin is a survival horror with one mission: avoid the rapture. <br/><br/>An alien species has invaded Earth and has caused the mass extinction of humanity. You are the last astronaut, stranded in space and forced to land in an abandoned space station for supplies. It's quiet.</p>\n<p>Listen and run from what stalks you. Grab the power cells. And escape.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a class project for a university game development course, but there is potential we will expand this into publishing territory. Thanks for playing! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T13:37:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a4/1a4a78fea314c7a3620a4b68e7f8f061.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maddie", "ndlovelace13", "Qrane", "ViperFangs", "wbagley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
