You will be swapping paint and speeding through laps on a selection of unique tracks packed with obstacles and hidden shortcuts. Use either two-handed melee weapons to whack other players or sneakily shoot down their karts, all while trying to cross the finish line in first place.<br/><br/><h3>Wide Range Of Control Options</h3>Enjoy a next-level racing experience with Super Immersive control. You can grab the wheel in one hand and a weapon in the other, or even wield two weapons at the same time! Steering Wheel Support steps up the immersion factor with force feedback, letting you feel every bump, turn, and obstacle. If your hand gets tired from smashing opponents we also have a simpler Rest Mode control option for casual play and a great way to play in tight space.<br/><br/><h3>Full hand Weapons &amp; Power-ups</h3>From machine guns to frying pans, Dash Dash World has an awesome selection of weapons that you can use to get ahead of the competition. But it is not so straightforward with counterplay, where you can blind your opponents with Face Blaster as well as their minions such as Angry Crimson and more. Nothing is certain until you reach that finish line.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Step into the World Of Speed</h3>Racers can drift around tight corners and charge their nitro and boost chain to reach max speeds during those tight finish line sprints. Pro players can use drafting to increase their speed sticking closely behind your competitors, gaining a slipstream effect. Better yet, use your speed off big ramps to start gliding over those spectacular views and clench a victorious landing.<br/><br/><h3>Racing Modes For Everyone</h3>Dash Dash World is great for players of all skill levels. There is a great variety of modes to choose from, including casual matches, a pro challenge, boss fights, and online tournaments! If you want to take things a step further and prove that you own the road, tune-up your engine and turn on the Pro Racing mode. Every obstacle and shortcut will never feel so intimidatingly refreshing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Thrilling Racing Journey</h3>Get your ride ready and go on an adventure in the single-player, open-ended Story mode. You can take on over 100 challenges from tons of cool characters, learning more about them along the way. Make no mistake about it, this storyline has more twists and turns than a Nolan movie! Complete this mode and you will turn into a Dash Dash pro in no time.<br/><br/><h3>Ambitious Online Experiences</h3>During our beta period, we hosted over 10,000 matches. Using this data, we have crafted an all-new flow that minimizes wait times and maximizes the fun during peak and off peak hour. Dash Dash World offers an extensive online experience with over 200 Achievements, Quests, as well as friendly and competitive Tournaments. Overall, Dash Dash World offers 100 hours of exciting content, exclusive items, and a prestigious hall of fame waiting for you to conquer.<h3>All About Social Interaction</h3>Race together and interact with your friends to maintain your position on your Race Team or Personal Ladder. Express yourself during races by sending Personalized Emotes and honking your unique Car Horn at the perfect moment. You can even taunt your opponents at the finish line with a Victory Pose and impress them with your souped-up Profile Card. <br/><br/><h3>Real Motion Sickness Prevention</h3>Tight turns and intense tracks might be too intense for new VR players. To help new players feel more comfortable, we\u2019ve added plenty of accessibility options. There are 6 different Comfort Modes to try, along with special Orientation classes that have been tested extensively with promising results. This lets you stay immersed in the game while staying safe from motion sickness.<br/><br/><h3>Customize Your Kart and Character </h3>There are over 1 trillion customization combinations available, and even more with future tournaments. Pick your favorite parts, right down to the detail of rims, dashboard, interior, and your boost effect. Personalize your character and looks from head to toe so you can stand out on any track!<br/><br/><h3>Made For the Love Of Virtual Reality</h3>For the past 2 years, over 60 talented developers have hand-crafted each circuit, weapon, and obstacle for the best VR experience possible. We\u2019ve pioneered VR specific features such as two-handed immersive driving, dynamic minimap, motion sickness prevention options and more. We will also be launching unified gameplay parity across all VR platforms with a smooth cross-continent multiplayer network.<h3>Drive, Shoot &amp; Drift like never before.
