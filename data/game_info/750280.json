{"id": 750280, "slug": "my-garden-1999", "name": "My Garden (1999)", "name_original": "My Garden (1999)", "description": "<p>My Garden is, just like it says on the tin, a game about gardening.</p>\n<p>You are a young girl who is sent off to your grandmother&#39;s home to help her out with her gardening, as her age is making it more difficult for her to tend to it herself. Much of the gameplay is very reminiscent of Harvest Moon; time passes in days &amp; hours, and players have a life gauge which limits the amount of work they can do in the course of one game day, but it can be slightly replenished by eating sweets or resting on benches. The player character can also interact with other people in the neighborhood, who occasionally come to visit the garden. Indoor sequences are presented in an isometric viewpoint, while outdoor gardening sequences are shown from a top-down angle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T15:52:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31e/31e618fd4f0e8766d540cae1f63f22f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Technosoft"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Technosoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
