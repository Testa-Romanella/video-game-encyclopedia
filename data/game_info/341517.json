I'm still learning Unity and I didn't feel quite confident to start working with it with such a tight schedule for that gamejam.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was created by first trying to put as many vile ingredients (from a gamejam called Glinny's cauldron) as possible in the game and try to make sure that the story was still coherent and the game fun to play.<br/></p>\n<p>It was going really well, but all this time spend figuring out a way to making a good story, with decent animation and cutscenes and creating other very different ingredients from scratch (like a world map with fast travel and bad pathfinding, a name input screen, etc) was, unfortunately not spent making gameplay mechancis, levels, enemy variety and AI. And thus, I think the moment that you are actually playing during my game are probably the worst.<br/></p>\n<p>So, in the end, I have a kinda complete project, as in, the game can be played from start to finish, but I had to patch most of my levels and bosses with simple text describing what would had happen. <br/></p>\n<p>I now fully understand how those devs from the big companies that end up having to do this to cut money/time...<br/></p>\n<p>For instance, I also had two more fully playable character with a different feel from Monkey, but I didn't get the chance to create a level where they would be playable after the player recruit them.</p>\n<p>It's my first game ever, and I think I might keep working on it, even if it's only for fun. I certainly intend on adding those two playable characters, at least 1 level each where their special talent can be used and at least 3 or 4 of all the bosses that I had in mind.<br/></p>\n<p>Or maybe I won't and I'll keep those idea for a future project that I will actually own.<br/></p>\n<p>Important note: I do not own the art or the music of the game.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>EDIT: With Version 2 posted the following day, I can now say that this is much closer to what I was trying to achieve, albeit still pretty far from the full potential, since I still had to cut many things.<br/></p><br/>Made in Construct.<br/>\n<p>How to Play:<br/>Open the folder for Window 32 or 64.<br/>Double-click on nw,exe<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T05:25:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00e48daec7f35b43ac9763d08bbd73be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maxvsthegames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
