After the time runs out the level resets and you respawn. Another character also spawns and executes exactly the actions that you did last round. Within a limited number of resets, you and your clones have to destroy all targets</p>\n\n<p>This prototype was developed by me over the course of three days in 2017 (I never used Unreal before). <br/></p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0 </p>\n<ul><li>WASD + Mouse to move</li><li>Left mouse to shoot</li><li>R to restart</li></ul>\n<p>https://github.com/johannesCmayer/TimeWarperUE</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T08:37:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd0/bd0cb2d333ba76b54d6546da8ca88525.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["johannesCmayer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
