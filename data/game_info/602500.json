This game was developed for the ILRN Game Jam 2021.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Overview of the Game/Player Instructions:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have been living in the city of Burnsville. It is disgusting and the environment is just \u2018Gross!\u2019 Because of these conditions, you're on your way to the bus stop to leave the city to never return. Along the way, your friend, Ray, is worried about you and is asking to take time to talk with them before you leave. Ray is begging you stay and that it is not as bad as you think. You get on the bus to leave but wait...you wake back up again in your apartment from earlier in the morning? But How?\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>In this game, we wanted to show that climate actions do not have to be big in order to show changes in your environment while encompassing UN Goal 13 for climate action. This game is aimed at showing that simple tasks that can be performed on your way to your end goal can affect the environment around you. As you play this game, you will notice the subtle changes that are taking place around you. Climate action does not have to be big, it's the little tasks that help inspire the others to take action on the climate as well!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>To move about the world:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Pane Camera:</strong> Move your mouse around\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Move: </strong>WASD key\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Interact with UI:</strong> Left Mouse Button\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developers:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Matthis Niederschider (University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna)\r\n</p>\n<p>Khang Jer Pang (University College Dublin)\r\n</p>\n<p>Nicolo Allado (George Mason University)\r\n</p>\n<p>Katarena Jarrell (Unity College)\r\n</p>\n<p>Mikial Jonas (University of Westminster)</p>\n<p>Becca Malcom (Northeastern University)\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\nModels\r\n<p>Door <em>by</em> Jan Fidler</p>\n<p>Phone\u00a0<em>by</em> float3D</p>\n<p>City\u00a0<em>by</em> Gnome's Artworks</p>\n<p>UI\u00a0<em>by</em> Landan Lloyd</p>\n<p>Clipboard\u00a0<em>by</em> cookiepopworks.com</p>\n<p>Cola Can\u00a0<em>by</em> YGS Assets</p>\n<p>Other Trash\u00a0<em>by</em> BlankfaceStanislav</p>\n<p>Bedroom furniture\u00a0<em>by</em> Night Forest</p>\n<p>Fences\u00a0<em>by</em> Broken Vector</p>\n<p>Light switch\u00a0<em>by</em> Ferocious Industries</p>\n<p>Grafitti\u00a0<em>by</em> Guetto Games</p>\n<p>Park\u00a0<em>by</em> Polygon-Park</p>\n<p>Car\u00a0<em>by</em> art georg</p>\n<p>Sink and toilet\u00a0<em>by</em> Deployer</p>\n<p>Bike\u00a0<em>by</em> Sirik</p>\n<p>Recycling bins\u00a0<em>by</em> SpaceZeta</p>\n<p>Bus\u00a0<em>by</em> LB3D</p>\n<p>Kitchen\u00a0<em>by</em> Fractured Brain Studios</p>\n<p>Other furniture\u00a0<em>by</em> OneProgram's</p>\n<p>Washing machine\u00a0<em>by</em> South Studios</p>\n<p>Kitchen props\u00a0<em>by</em> Jake Sullivan</p>\n\r\nSound Effects\r\n<p>Glass pickup/throw\u00a0<em>by</em> Anton</p>\n<p>Can pickup/throw\u00a0<em>by</em> cower</p>\n<p>Plastic bottle pickup/throw\u00a0<em>by</em>\u00a016FPanskaLipovska_Katerina</p>\n<p>Switch flick\u00a0<em>by</em> MastersDisaster</p>\n<p>Pen signing\u00a0<em>by</em> florianreichelt</p>\n<p>Water flowing\u00a0<em>by</em> BurghRecords</p>\n<p>Phone vibration\u00a0<em>by</em> lartti<br/></p>\n<p>Door opening\u00a0<em>by</em> qubodup</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Wind of Hope by Mikael Manvelyan</p>\n<p>Down To the Wire by Lance Conrad<br/></p>\r\nTextures\r\n<p>Wooden floor\u00a0<em>by</em> Casual2D</p>\n<p>Bathroom floor\u00a0<em>by</em> randomze</p>\n\r\nSprites\r\n<p>Graffiti image<em> by</em> robertgodo1976</p>\n<p>Graffiti image<em> by</em> unknown</p>\n<p>Graffiti image<em>\u00a0by\u00a0unknown</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T04:54:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55b6b55f65e60eefaaab758a0a047421.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OneThatEatYou", "UNity League Team!"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
