This program was started and dropped because of the difficulty and my lack of motivation, but finally, it\u2019s here! This is a little program that could serve as a reminder of the game Puerto Rico for me, or for you to play with the computer when you\u2019re alone. You could also compare scores with a friend. More about the game could be read in the \u201cprogrammer\u2019s comments\u201d section of the game\u2019s help file.</p>\n<p>This program is a simplified <strong>single-player video game</strong> adaptation of <em>Puerto Rico</em>. The goal of the game is to ship resources from Puerto Rico to the Old World and get famous. To do so, you\u2019ll need to assign colonists to work on seeds and factories to produce goods, which you may ship back for fame or trade for money. Try to get more famous than the computer (or your friend) and you win the game! As of 25/10/2015, there is an added <strong>San Juan Mode</strong> that mimics the gameplay of the card game <em>San Juan</em>, plus an \u201c<strong>Anniversary Edition</strong>\u201d for the bank\u2019s background.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is mostly based off of the original board game <em>Puerto Rico</em> by Andreas Seyfarth, which was published by <em> Alea</em> in German, <em>Rio Grande Games</em> in English and <em> \u039a\u03ac\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1</em> in Greek, though the villa and statue are taken from its expansions. In the 4th picture above are the buildings in the \u201cstandard buildings\u201d mode in my version of the game and their respective prices, and given below is a little guide to the roles and their actions in graphical form (a mashup of the original board game and my version, since only the original uses the words \u201cbuilder\u201d and \u201cprospector\u201d while it is mine that has no role privilege):</p>\n\n<p>This game probably isn\u2019t the best rendition of <em>Puerto Rico</em>, but it nevertheless serves my purpose. In addition, I also tried with making some new things, such as the final bonus screen with the text appearing one after another, the \u201chover hints\u201d, as well as using my own graphics (and not retro graphics) which I\u2019ve put on my <em>Puerto Rico</em> instructions card for my board games club a few years back. This is my third adaptation of a big board game into a video game, with the first one being <em>Shh! Don\u2019t Wake Dad\u2026 </em>and the second one being Monsters Menace America: Rampage<em>.</em> After the game\u2019s been mostly finished, I added the random buildings mode, which wasn\u2019t originally intended, but seems to be something liked by the original Puerto Rico\u2019s players, and I thus put it in, as the original version of my game had little variation. There was an original plan to show the computer\u2019s doubloons as tiebreaker but in the end I thought that only made winning artificially harder and more luck-based, plus complicating the game, and thus I left that out, but the doubloons you have could be used as a tiebreaker when you are comparing scores with a friend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bb/3bb4548619093b1cf63caebbc810fb62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tangentg"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
