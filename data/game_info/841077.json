A Stranger In Your Eyes is a storytelling game with fun swinging around! It focuses on a mom who wants her son to know that even if she passes. He will not be alone. The mother is suffering from a disease called Alzheimer's. This is my first gameJam, and a game that I fully built from scratch, composed, and exported in 4 days. Other than that thanks for supporting me and I hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T07:46:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/958/958725a6e4c6ec7330edc403be6cc463.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skulldude"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
