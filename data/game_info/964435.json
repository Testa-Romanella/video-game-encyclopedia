It was released in 2022 during the Nintendo Indie World showcase!<br/><br/>You will go on a strange rebirth adventure on Babel. The crew would use Memory Extractor to erase your memories before launching you into the afterlife with the cloud cannon. Passengers frequently moan that it's too late to say farewell to the past, but the crew's prime focus is gathering memories as fuel!<br/>If you enjoy absorbing stories and mind-boggling puzzles, you've come to the right spot! Across four chapters, you'll need to go\u00a0back in time and subtly rewrite history, trigger the butterfly effect, solve the puzzles hidden in it, and even change the future of Babel!<br/><br/><br/><br/>From the drenched deck to the bustling Central Station, the busy Memory Factory to the empty Giant Boiler...... Explore the Babel, meet panic-stricken humans and tough crew members, and investigate unprecedented instruments and strange creatures!<br/><br/><br/><br/>You need to help the trapped characters overcome difficulties: escape from the Interrogation Room, collect Stonehearth Crab Egg, and find mysterious signal sources... Don't expect to succeed with brute force!<br/>Fortunately, you can travel back in time and discover what put them into trouble. Once you've located the crucial event, you can rewrite it with the pen in your hand. This move will immediately trigger a butterfly effect, change the plot's path, and reverse the current situation!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Feeling clueless? Then make use of this notebook.  It will guide you through the process of assembling the collected evidence into a comprehensive reasoning chain!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pilot stuck in the monsoon, the head chef worrying about the canned food, the swimming team captain chasing fugitives...... Oh, and the poor circus clown looking for his daughter! The fates of the characters complement each other, and this is destined to be a tragicomedy about separation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Combining cute and funny, retro and cartoon, Babel is about to set sail. Grab your boat ticket, step on the deck, and enjoy the carnival!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-04T05:40:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aee/aee986e20c266b15d711d48cb93d2947.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 388, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["StarryStarry"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixmain"], "esrb_rating": null}
