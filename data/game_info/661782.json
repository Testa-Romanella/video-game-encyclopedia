CrossOver Ubuntu works, but also flaky, but it's not noticeable. CrossOver on macOS works but popups won't work.)</p>\n<p>I might even make a version for Android.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Developer: Skoopyy (youtube.com/SkoopyyYouTube)</p>\n<p>Music: Skoopyy (youtube.com/SkoopyyYouTube)</p><p>Music: ibrahim (https://open.spotify.com/artist/38osEo6ebgNhOrlD5Xi4iZ)</p>\n<p>Testers:</p>\n<p>Asymmetrical</p>\n<p>gamer supreme</p>\n<p>Koverra</p>\n<p>Nishikata</p>\n<p>Soulgaming1</p>\n\n<p>This game was made using GameMaker: Studio 1.4 with Audacity and Adobe Audition for audio,\u00a0 Ableton Live 10 Suite\u00a0for music, GIMP and Paint.net, Photoshop was used for making the UI elements and logo.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T00:44:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b8507cb52ec566381a4bef60248078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skoopyy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
