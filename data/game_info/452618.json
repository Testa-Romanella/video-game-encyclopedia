The project is very ambitious and we don\u2019t know the exact final scope yet. We\u2019re inspired by games like Stardew Valley, Minecraft or Factorio.</p>\n<p>You can play the game right now at  https://pony.town/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-05T02:47:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38a834019a8740cd002fe872c07f782d.JPG", "website": "https://pony.town/", "rating": 4.19, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 36, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 5, "playing": 15}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 47, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 57, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
