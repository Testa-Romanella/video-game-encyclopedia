We were not able to actually implement all the movement of the tiles in time so all we got is one simple level to show the buttons and some of the tiles moving. We actually finished 3 levels\u00a0but could not implement them because we were not fast enough for the deadline :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a29d8d13ede9adbbe0a1a878d6f6567f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xadrol"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
