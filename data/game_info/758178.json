I said TAPES, because the Commodore programmers also throw FLOPPY DISKS. Its not your quest, but if you catch them, it holds a place in your hand.  You can hold 5 items, so you should count it in your head. After that it will dropped next items, and your T-shirt changed to red.\r\n You have to put the items in the taxi, just go there and hit.\r\n Now you can earn points: casettes only, disks worths 0 point (but your hand is now free again). Your T-shirt is green again.\r\n You can miss 10 casettes then the game over.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Hope you will enjoy the game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>If\u00a0 you like the game, come back to next season of Basic 10 liner contest, i hope i can write another game based on the soon released Moleman 5 movie.\r\n Moleman 4 is my favorite in the series you sound watch it, I also recommended Moleman 2, and i know Moleman 5 also will be great. Please check https://moleman4.com/ or https://vakondok4.hu/ for more information.s\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n  </p>\n<p>You can use arrow keys to move, catch the items and count them, because you cannot hold and will drop after 5 of them.\r\n Go to the taxi on the left side and press \"left arrow\"\u00a0 key to put the items to the taxi (Disk: 0 point, Casette: 1 point)\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you missed 10 casettes the game ends. You can restart by pressing \"Y\" or quit if you press other key.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Enjoy the game!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>left arrow - left move\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0right arrow - right move\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>at the end: Y key pressed restarts the game others will exit.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>CODE DESCRIPTIONS:\r\n  </p>\n<p>I have to used constants to reduce the size of the lines.
