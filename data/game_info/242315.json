There is no police to slow you down and no one to tell you off for driving into buildings. Practice your jumping skills or just drive as fast as you like, but be careful not to roll the beat on its side. If you do crash, don't worry a quick reset will have your truck all shinny and new again.... Ready for you to smash it up again. Don't forget to use the different camera angles to give you either the real behind the wheel feeling or a cool view.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d6/9d6d853d1939dd3e3c62b6c86ebd037e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["freeonlinegames.com"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["FreeOnlineGames.com FZE"], "esrb_rating": null}
