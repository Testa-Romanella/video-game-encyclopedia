{"id": 248494, "slug": "asterion", "name": "Asterion", "name_original": "Asterion", "description": "ASTERION is a 3D action and adventure game with puzzle elements, very much in the vein of Zelda games with a dash of Souls-like. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are Asterion, last in a long line of minotaurs bred to brave the dangers of the Labyrinth of Crete: an ancient, enigmatic, massive structure.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIts purpose is a mystery, but yours is not: you must go in and keep the world from ruin. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInside the cyclopean dungeon you will explore the Five Warden Realms from a central hub. Each is a unique, hand-crafted and interconnected environment with its own fierce enemies and challenges to overcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo aid you in your quest and face the risks of the Labyrinth, you are equiped with the mighty Labrys: a powerful ceremonial axe of heros of old, key to unlocking the mysteries of the past. Without the Labrys by your side, you'd be doomed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn each Realm you must seek one of the Five Wardens: powerful entities that will test your mettle in epic boss battles. Why they are here and what they are guarding is yours to uncover. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOvercome their challenge to prove worthy of their Blessings: fractions of an ancient ritual and key to unlocking new, upgradeable abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnly then will you be ready to face the final challenge and risk saving the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe world hangs on a thread, Asterion: heed the call of the Labrys, face the Wardens, acquire their Blessings, uncover mysteries and prevent catastrophe! Fulfill your destiny!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTLDR: Your classic, Zelda-like get-the-five-McGuffins-save-the-world action/adventure set in a mix of Bronze Age Mythologies. Also, you are a minotaur, Harry.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37d/37d1bdb1f47bd0c0fc20d02249599384.jpg", "website": "http://glass-bear.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glass Bear Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Glass Bear Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
