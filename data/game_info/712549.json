It's a thinky turn-based game in which you get three actions per turn and use them to lay and destroy electric walls hoping to catch the different fireflies and add them to your jar. It's not about having the most fireflies overall but the most of the most different colors.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach type of fly rewards the player who caught it with different special abilities: extra actions, bubble freeze, lanterns, and bringing in the love bug. These bonuses must be strategically used at the right times to capture the most bugs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T03:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/406/40645f04879949d0664d689154cbea27.jpg", "website": "https://offbitstudios.com/little-sparks", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Offbit Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Offbit Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
