The player walks around the town as the main character, but takes control of the model robot during fights. There are six robot models available, each with different stats and special moves. The models are Max, Gong, Axe, Speed, Lon and Borot. Over time, the player earns credits and buys parts to improve their model. In addition to the story mode, there is a simple versus mode that allows the player to fight immediately.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/639/639d3771461474f3084f2e6c90af10cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Japan System Supply"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Capcom", "Sunsoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
