There isn't going to be any mechanics in the game really but the player is free to explore around the level as much as they want.</p>\n<p>For the controls use the mouse to look around and you can use the arrow keys to move around. Right now you can fly around the level but in the final stages of production I am going to change that and make a first person camera so you can walk around the level.\u00a0 When you first load in make sure to click on the screen because the camera goes all weird and all over the place if you don't.</p><p>When giving feedback I would like people to comment on what they think about the level as a whole but also what you like the look of in the environment and what you think could look better.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:37:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a39/a393a336df421b5d54b5283ceef58937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael_j_123"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
