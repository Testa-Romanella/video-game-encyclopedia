{"id": 736167, "slug": "osman", "name": "Osman", "name_original": "Osman", "description": "<p>Osman[a] is a side-scrolling action platforming game produced by Mitchell Corp. that was released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1996. Many ex-Capcom staff including Kouichi Yotsui (credited as Isuke), worked on the original arcade version of Strider and designed Osman as an unofficial sequel to Strider. Yotsui directed both titles.</p>\n<p>In contrast to Strider&#39;s futuristic Kazakh-Soviet setting, Osman is set in a neon-lit cyberpunk Arabian setting, while Strider Hiryu is replaced by a Middle Eastern protagonist named Kirin who fights without any weapons. 1UP.com included the game in its &quot;Games to Play Before You Die&quot; list. The game&#39;s bizarre plot supposedly mocks director Kouichi Yotsui&#39;s experience at Capcom after Strider.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T16:48:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/1684ba7a5fb1723b7848277a9390f21f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": [], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
