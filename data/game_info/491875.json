The only thing he can do to escape this painful routine is spend his money on shady apps he finds on the internet! On a day much like any other, his boss Erika is giving him a lecture about his poor performance. Our protagonist finally tries out his latest purchase, a Hypnosis app, and to his surprise it actually works!<br />\nHe starts innocently enough, asking Erika why she picks on him so much. After hearing her honest answer, that she just hates him for being an unattractive loser who is a total eye-sore, you bet its time to put this hypnosis app to use by throwing her common sense out the window and warping her mind into the perfect cock-hungry slut to make up for all the misery she caused!<br />\nTranslated version of the original Japanese Visual Novel<br />\nErika is fully voiced with their original Japanese dialogue.<br />\nOriginal artwork HD upscaled with 16:9 and 4:3 variants.<br />\nHours of story content.<br />\nAudio including music and special effects.<br />\nEnhanced with character sprite animations.<br />\nGallery and Scene selections.<br />\n15 twisted sex scenes each more depraved than the last as Erika falls deeper under your control!<br />\nBitchy Boss&#39; Bimbofication is the English localization of a Visual Novel originally created by prolific Japanese developer Norn/Miel.
