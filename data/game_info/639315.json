GERALD!! The Quest For Chez! is a game developed by a 12 year old, alright? dont get cheesed in the comments of how trashy it was, I made this game because it was an idea I had for a long time. me and my friend were on my DSi, and we made this silly little animation, titling the character's name \"Gerald\". if your name is Gerald, then you are really cool. Have fun playing the game.\u00a0I will accept criticism as if it were a happy meal. or if you experience any bugs while playing the games, feel free to let me know in the comments. heed in mind that part 1 can no longer be updated, not unless i make a remaster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T07:06:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c0/7c05917bf2661d2abeb9255aebb52e99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zuk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
