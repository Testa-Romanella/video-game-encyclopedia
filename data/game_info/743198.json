Each drink will raise the Drunk Point by X points, X being the number of different types of MindBlocks eliminated.<br/>When DrunkPoint &gt; 10 you will move on to the next stage of drunkenness.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals:</strong><br/>To score 100 points or more, which means that the character will have a relaxing and trouble-free sleep for the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br/>As MindBlock only has 3 colours, blocks of the same colour are not necessarily the same block.<br/>It is recommended to slow down the game to appreciate the sound. There is no need to rush, time does not cause a penalty.<br/>As you get drunker, the character becomes more relaxed and the difficulty decreases accordingly, so when things get tough, just drink!<br/>Just drink!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T10:38:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ef/0eff54eeef2bc8f594c7b7460a12ab9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zjliuzj"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
