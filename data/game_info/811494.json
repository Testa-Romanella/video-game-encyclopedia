This is a fun top-down puzzle game staring Mousey, trying to stop Meowsy. Venture into the maze and collect all the cheese using Mousey's Kirby-like inhale ability. Unlike the original game, there is an additional world, being a science lab where Mousey was born (as well as Lario). We wouldn't have this game without Videodojo, the GBG community, and Construct 3.\u00a0 (Clips and pictures of the original game\u00a0 are down here)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T11:39:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df7d75e513932f9ea9186dfa737b9881.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChunkyDaGameDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
