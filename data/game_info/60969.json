The main goal was to create a slow, immersive ride throughout rocky trails, forest hills and flat deserts. That kind of ride is the best way to admire beauty of rock crawling.THE CHALLANGE - Pure and Simple<br />\nThe challange is simple: on trail you will find ten gates composed of two cones, none of which should be touched or tripped. For every gate passed you will be awarded with points, for every cone tripped you will loose them. Be precise and concentrated to gather as much points as you can, but be aware of the ticking clock. You have  only 5 minutes to complete each stage, so be carefull with the throttle ! Too much or too little can doom you.<br />\nPure Rock Crawling  encourages you to take on this challange to unlock new maps and vehicles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T13:41:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/365/365ea6d48abb0716dc13f6609d6fc56f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.29, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 24, "toplay": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 339, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maciej Kuzianik"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Maciej Kuzianik"], "esrb_rating": null}
