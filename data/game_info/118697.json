In celebration of this milestone, I recreated the Where's the Cheat game from the \"Everything Else Vol. 3\" DVD - completely from the ground up aside from the sounds, which were ripped from the DVD itself. I even re-sprited all the characters and objects since the quality of them on the DVD weren't too up-to-par for ripping.</p><p>This remake is available for Windows PCs and Android devices!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd9/dd9e928f7696da97d3c8808843974017.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Jack-of-All Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
