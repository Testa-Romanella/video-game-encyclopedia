He teams up with Professor Discovery to recover the Crystal of Amol from the Caves of Gehenna. Will Benjamin find what he is looking for, or is this adventure way more than he asked for?</p><p>While this is very much a traditional RPG in style, the unique types of powers and how they \"damage\" the enemy is hilarious. The world doesn't take itself seriously, and there is humor everywhere. The story is quite different as well, and doesn't end the way you'd think. Reality, sometimes, can be harsh.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54ed845f6fb91e8d010c366a30b041c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ruth_Studio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
