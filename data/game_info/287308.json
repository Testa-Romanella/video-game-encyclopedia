The player controls Tulho, a pig tha lives in the decaying town of Baycomsville who, upon completing his 5-year birthday, sees himself free to try to lift higher flights. Perhaps so high that they take you to the mythical promised land. <br/><br/>\"Sa\u00edda\" has its greatest fun and replay in the transposition of the obstacles, which hinder the progression of the player, while at the same time, if used correctly, serve to propel him. These obstacles are meticulously organized at each stage according to the rhythm of the soundtrack, giving very pleasurable rhythm to the gameplay. By any small mistake, the player may lose the flow of his movements in a way that does not have a return. But as you play more and more, the player learns to use the powers of Tulho better, adapts to the rhythm of the soundtrack, and through repetition, enhancement of the character's abilities and motivation to follow where the journey of our little pig will lead, dominate the game and feel his evolution as a player.<br/><br/> The development of \"Sa\u00edda\" MVP for the Game Jam Gamethon Hacktudo 2018 was carried out by the team consisting of: <br/></p>\n<p>- Raphael Sanguinete: Concept, Production, Narrative and Game Design<br/>- \u00cdtalo Nievinski: Concept, Production, Game Design and Level Design<br/>- Diogo Souza: Concept, Programming and Game Design<br/>- Enrick Magellan: Concept, Illustration and GameArt<br/>- Bettina Calmon: Concept, Soundtrack and Sound Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T04:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6d/c6df03b1efd87a78d581fea422a790dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Italo Nievinski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
