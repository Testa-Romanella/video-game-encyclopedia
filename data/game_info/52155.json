So when I started making games for iPhone, I was keen on building a proper platformer for the system. I think my first attempt, SHAARK!, turned out fun but also quite short. <br/><br/>Dig Dog is a much larger and richer experience. Each time you play, the levels are freshly generated. Of course the worlds get steadily harder, but as you dig more you\u2019ll discover a variety of challenges and goals. Will you spend your coins on a helpful item at the shop in 1-3 or horde them in an attempt for a high score. Maybe you\u2019ll try to unlock new Warp Bones or try and beat all 4 worlds without dying. Or maybe just chill out in Free Dig mode with some cathartic digging.<br/><br/>I love destructive environments. You can pretty much dig up a whole level if you want. (Although that can be quite dangerous.)<br/><br/>As you dig more, you may start to find some of the game\u2019s hidden depths. For instance, if you fast stomp on an enemy you\u2019ll create sparks that ripple to the left and right. These sparks are both useful and dangerous. It depends on when and how you use them.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy Dig Dog. I think there\u2019s a lot to uncover here!<br/><br/>-Rusty", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44c/44c26a865e8f198fab7a7d5353ff11d1_luqEqJd.jpg", "website": "http://rustymoyher.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Rusty Moyher"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Rusty Moyher"], "esrb_rating": null}
