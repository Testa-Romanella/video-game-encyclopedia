Sounds a little bit like hell. You find yourself in a room with two doors, as soon as you leave the room you notice to be in a maze together with other guests and you better GET THE FUCK OUT and do so FAST! Use the cocaine in your left hand in order to not run out of Stamina (because you might be dead if you run out) and keep sprinting! DON'T! STOP! SPRINTING! It kinda seems you have an addictive relationship with substances hmmmm.</p>\n<p>Find your way through the maze to one of the endings... one of the endings? :O</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the time that you spend with the game :) ...didn't I do it for you...</p>\n<p><strong>WHY WE MADE THIS GAME:</strong></p>\n<p>Markiplier uploaded a Video called \"Need Some Help\" in the beginning of March 2023, in which he asked his community to send him recommendations for short horror games, because he was super busy with his movie (which he was filming at that time). That's why we decided to F*CKING MAKE A SHORT HORROR GAME!</p>\n<p>We're 2 noobs with no experience in Unreal Engine 5 and set ourselves the challenge to complete the game within 7 days... WHICH WE F*CKING DID! lol\u00a0</p>\n<p>So if you wanna make a game, throw yourself into the cold water and start making on! :D Make use of YouTube Tutorials and forums!</p>\n<p><strong>WHO IS THIS GAME FOR?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, Markiplier. BUT! Also for everyone who likes a quick and fun horror games with a huge-ass maze, cocaine, shit load of enemies and multiple endings! YOU WILL BE STRESSED! hehe</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T23:24:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd6/cd689f63f578cf4518aaeaf5e16e04eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 294, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RubenStubenGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
