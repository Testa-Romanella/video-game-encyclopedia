Unlike most of the humans of this world, she can use magic and communicate with intelligent creatures. In trying to live up to her motto of always doing what's necessary, she often finds herself in uncomfortable situations.<br/><br/>Along the way to exploring the land of Xanthia, you'll gain allies to help you face the many challenges that await. Do you have what it takes to stop the Taint?<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/>Old school, 2D style RPG<br/>Turn-based combat<br/>Partial spell customization<br/>Mature/immature humor<br/>Mini-games<br/><br/><br/>The Tainted was created using the RPG Maker MV engine and makes use of a lot of content created by the RPG Maker community. It attempts to tell a unique and funny story, as well as show off some of the talent found in this often overlooked community. Much of the humor is of a mature nature and is not intended for younger viewers. So, if you enjoy classic RPGs with turn-based combat and are also an adult that still thinks farts are funny....you might also enjoy The Tainted.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T03:58:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/762/762c42d8b91691c295f73be57dbdee6e.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/The-Tainted-102886545469345", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 471, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Celestial Software", "Chris D Herring"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Twilyt", "Chris D Herring"], "esrb_rating": null}
