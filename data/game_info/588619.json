The more enemies you kill, the more bullets you shoot, thus increasing the chances of killing yourself (bullets bounce off the walls).</p>\n<p>I <strong>strongly </strong>recommend downloading the game over playing the WebGL version, as it runs much smoother and the effects are a bit nicer (the WebGL build feels a bit laggy in my opinion! Please use fullscreen if you do want to play the web version).</p>\n<p>You can earn up to three achievements if you are tough enough to survive this jungle bullet hell:</p>\n<ul><li>Survive 1 minute</li><li>Shoot 200 bullets in one game</li><li>Shoot 100 enemies in one game</li></ul><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>WASD to move, aim with mouse cursor, left mouse button to shoot, that's it :)</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>All assets (with the exception of the font: \"Bad\u00a0Signal\"\u00a0 https://www.dafont.com/bad-signal.font) are created by myself.
