Remove it by clicking and dragging the\u00a0mouse. Players find themselves with ID cards that represent their respective characters. On all of the ID cards, the badge numbers begin with a zero and then a single digit number from 1 to 9. Because there are four players, they must figure out the order of their ID numbers to discover the code. In our prototype, the order is indicated by a big number on the card. The players must enter the code (5917) to open the door. Old Palettes block the door to the next room. Move them by clicking and dragging the mouse.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PART II</strong><br/>They now find themselves in an escape pod (cargo plane inspired). They see four chairs alongside one of the walls. Underneath all four chairs is a rail for a sliding drawer. However, all\u00a0the drawers are missing except for one. The one drawer still there is locked. The three chairs that are missing the drawer can be adjusted and clicked into place in an upright position, but the\u00a0chair with the drawer cannot. Opposite to that is the door they are trying to get into. Hidden in the second stacked drawer by the door is the key to the drawer underneath the chair. Inside the drawer they find an airplane infographic that tells them to put the chairs upright for \u201csafety reasons\u201d in order to manually override the door. After pulling the drawer out from under the chair, it is unstuck and the players can move it. After the players position all of the chairs upright, the door opens automatically.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T04:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d3/5d336b5eaa6a6413b91003e47f12fa4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["justin2jam", "ACStudiosX", "Cashel Condon", "Amber Smith", "Stephanie Wilhite"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
