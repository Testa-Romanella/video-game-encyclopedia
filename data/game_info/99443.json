With the combined efforts of historians and robotics engineers, Joust is brought to the public and reaches global popularity. A historically inaccurate recreation of the classic medieval sport with robotic combatants set in an arena that sits in the sky.</p>\n<p>When the very damaged manuscript describing jousting was unearthed, the galaxy at large took great interest in its craft and has done its best (very poor) job of recreating the age-old craft of the proving sport of knights. \u00a0Players controls one of these knightly champions as they charge on unconventional mounts through equally bizarre arenas in an attempt to defeat their opponent and be crowned the champion of the Joust.</p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a7</em><em>Gameplay Description</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>At an overhead level, Joustaposition is a split-screen first-person game where two players ride their own mounts through a minigame where they earn points based on them completing the game successfully. \u00a0At the end of the mini-game the players enter a joust where they will attempt to hit each other\u2019s shield to reduce their opponent's \u201cStability\u201d (health) to 0 and increase their own personal score. \u00a0When the opponent\u2019s Stability is reduced to 0, they are Vulnerable, and a single critical hit\u00a0on a subsequent joust will unhorse them, leading to victory for the player.<br/></p>\n<p>\tThe gameplay of Joustaposition is composed of the players controlling a lance and shield (lance controlled via the right analog stick, and shield controlled via the D-pad) while they ride on-rails atop their mounts around the arena. \u00a0From a first-person perspective the player will be aiming the lance (within a controlled margin) around the screen to make contact with targets (rings, dummies, the other player\u2019s shield). \u00a0Additionally, the player will control the shield via the D-pad to play a number of set animations during the jousting phase to make it move.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a7Controller Scheme</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><p>D-Pad</p></li></ul>\n<ul><li><p>Up, Right, Down, and Left all play unique animations of the shield when pressed at the beginning of the joust phase</p></li></ul>\n<ul><li><p>Right Analog Stick</p><ul><li><p>Directly controls the motion of the lance.</p></li><li><p>Moves in a shape equivalent to the spherical range of the analog stick</p></li><li><p>Used to navigate the in-game menus via cursor</p></li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><p>A-Button</p><ul><li><p>Used to confirm selection of a player`s character in the character select screen</p></li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><p>Start Button</p><ul><li><p>Used in menu navigation</p></li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>**PLEASE NOTE YOU CAN PLAY WITH A KEYBOARD - PLEASE CONSULT THE INCLUDED TEXT FILE IN THE KEYBOARD BUILD FOR INSTRUCTIONS**</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3a/e3a1aa64c3aca39d961d54e5b5ebf870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joustaposition"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
