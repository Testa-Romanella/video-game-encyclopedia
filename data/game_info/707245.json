If you've followed me on twitter (@KelvinvanHoorn) or my website, you could see that most of this prototype was made a few months back but I've only now gotten around to making a proper menu with settings and releasing it in a playable state.</p>\n<p>If I were to continu work on this prototype I would focus first on improving the performance, updating the shaders, adding music, and\u00a0adding more settings like reversed inputs.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>A gamepad is recommended but not necessary.</p>\n<p>The game should work with mouse/keyboard and generic gamepads (PS and Xbox controllers should be fine, but haven't been tested).</p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Mouse &amp; keyboard</strong><strong>Gamepad</strong>Plane pitchW/S, Up/Down arrowLeft stick (y-direction)<br/>Plane rollA/D, Left/Right arrowLeft stick (x-direction)Plane yawQ/ELeft/Right triggerPlane throttleShift/ControlLeft/Right bumperCamera rotationMouse positionRight stickReset cameraLeft mouse buttonRight stick pressReset plane/mapSpace barSelectOpen menuEscapeStartMac &amp; Linux<p>I don't have a Mac or Linux system, so I have no clue if these versions work or not, nor do I plan on supporting them anytime soon.
