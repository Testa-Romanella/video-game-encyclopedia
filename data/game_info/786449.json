You can do nothing when you fall. So take out all your gamer accuracy and basic physics knowledge to go up.</p>\n<p>This game is a submission for the mini jam : frogs. As for the limitation part, I added a 30 second timer that increases the time speed by 10% every time it ends. Hardness limits are off the charts with this timer.</p>\n<p>Anyone who manages to win this game can send me an email on devanshu94537321@gmail.com and I will probably respond (Make the topic titled [game related]). I will be shocked if there is even one.</p>\n<p>So there you go! Enjoy playing this game and do not forget to donate as it helps me.</p>\n<p>Oh! And one more thing left click to jump wherever you want. Click farther away if you want to jump higher. There are no more controls. Press escape to pause (It will not stop your timer)</p>\n<p>All the things are made by me in 2 days. ( I did nothing on day 1)</p>\n<p>*This game has many bugs and glitches you can tell me in comments</p>\n<p>*I could not win my own game :|</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T10:12:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a277acc29a552484f83ed6b71731c885.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deadpool945"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
