It does have scoring, lives, and a lose condition, but was mostly coded to wrap my head around some concepts and prepare for an eventual fleshing-out of the core mechanics into a more fully realized game.</p><p>If you want to play it, you'll have to sideload it onto your phone. This may change in the future. I mostly am uploading it to itch.io for 1GAM.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dac/dacaf20788bf492b7414427d7e0f5d5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A Person of Note"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
