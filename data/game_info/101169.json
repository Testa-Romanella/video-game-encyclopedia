You cannot jump on or attack enemies so you must instead lure into traps such as jumping when they're above spikes to leave them to splatter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 4 areas and each is quite short, though when you get hit, you're dead and must start again so winning is an impressive accomplishment that I'm not sure anyone has yet to achieve! Good luck!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c31bcec2289ff7afd78487b9da54e469.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["b_random9"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
