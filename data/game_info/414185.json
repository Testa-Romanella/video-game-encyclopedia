However, you can not take too long, as that would lead to death from the freezing temperature.<br/>On your path, you may find clues about what happened to the previous survivor group that never returned.</p>\n<p>Headphones are recommended.</p>\n<p>Keys:<br/>- Arrow keys/WASD: Movement<br/>- E: Leave a light marker on the ground. If close enough to an already laid-down marker, pressing E will pick it up again.<br/>- R: Throw a flare to get a temporarily larger zone of light.<br/>- F: Drink a bottle of whiskey to temporarily maintain some warmth. Use sparingly, as you have a limited amount of whiskey.</p>\n<p>Made by:<br/>- Alejandra Mesa: Designer<br/>- Simon B\u00f8g: Programmer<br/>- Mathies\u00a0Wiencke: Programmer<br/>- Ingi Muller: Designer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:55:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e93/e938efe15aa3c2c301acdc80a1772cdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattWild"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
