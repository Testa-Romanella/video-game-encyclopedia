The game features full\u00a0freedom of movement and combat strategy. This project is in early development, but my plans for the final game include a wide array of fortresses and a deep combat system with different options and upgrades. In the meantime, enjoy this brief window to the game in the form of the first boss' legs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/718/718e581fdb47726ce7b1cd0c283819b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["tedAgriogianis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
