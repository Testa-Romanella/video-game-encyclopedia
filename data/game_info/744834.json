Original version: Evan Parton - Mr. Micro Ltd / CBM.\u00a0Commodore 16/Plus4,\u00a01986. Created with GB-Studio 2.0.0 beta5!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Original Story:</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>You are about to tee off on the CRAZIEST golf course you've ever seen! Featuring ten holes, each with its own unique set of obstacles which must be either avoided or used to your advantage. The ball's path will restart if it falls into a black hole or touches the wire. Each hole has a \"par\", this is the number of strokes in which it is possible to sink the ball. If you're lucky you may be able to complete a hole \"under par\".</p>\n<p><strong><em>How to play the game:</em></strong></p>\n<p>When the title screen appears, press the START button. There are eight possible directions in which you may hit the ball. There are displayed in the window at the bottom side of the screen. You also have control over the strength with which you hit your ball. This is displayed as a yellow bar at the bottom of the screen, next to the direction pad. The longer the yellow bar, the harder you hit your ball. Finally, information about the hole, its par, the number of strokes taken for the game are also displayed in the window.<br/></p>\n<p>Before you take a shot, you must choose the direction you want to take. This is done with the UP and DOWN keys. Move the direction anti-clockwise and moves the direction clockwise. Next you must decide on the strength with which you wish to hit the ball. The LEFT key decrease the force, and the RIGHT key increases it. Finally, press the \"A\", \"B\" or \"START\" button to to hit the ball. If you wish to skip a hole, and go on to the next one, you may do so by pressing the \"SELECT\" key. However, this carries a +10 stroke penalty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game ends when you have completed all ten holes, or if you reach 100 over par. See you in the clubhouse!</p>\n<p>Also available for download in .CIA format for the Nintendo 3DS virtual console!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Start the game</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong>Start\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Directions:</strong>\u00a0Cursor UP/DOWN<br/><strong>Strength:</strong>\u00a0Cursor LEFT/RIGHT<br/><strong>Hit the ball: </strong>A or\u00a0B or START\u00a0<br/><strong>Exit to the next hole:</strong> SELECT</p>\n<p>Controls in the browser:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game:\u00a0</strong>Enter<br/><strong>Directions: </strong>Arrow UP/DOWN<br/><strong>Strength:\u00a0</strong>Arrow LEFT/RIGHT<br/><strong>Hit the ball:\u00a0</strong>X, Z, Alt<br/><strong>Exit to the next hole:\u00a0</strong>Shift</p>\n<p>Original game (Commodore 16/Plus4 ) link:\u00a0http://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Crazy_Golf</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T10:03:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb9/bb9d4cb928a438a4f2b61531992aaf9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rajcs\u00e1nyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
