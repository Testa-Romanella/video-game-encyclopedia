{"id": 733697, "slug": "azerpg-marinoman", "name": "AZERPG (MarinoMan)", "name_original": "AZERPG (MarinoMan)", "description": "<p><strong>Introducing AZE-RPG</strong><br/></p>\n<p>AZE-RPG is a demake of the hit MMORPG World of Warcraft, aiming to emulate the gameplay and feel but with the 2d Game maker aesthetic. The game currently utilises basic RPG maker MV sprite work and tilesets with a goal to slowly change them once I'm able to pay a proper pixel artist.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Goal of the project is the completion of the zone Durotar (mapping has been fully completed, a total of 130 maps) and then see if there is any interest in the steady development of the other zones. Several dungeons have been designed as well and 1 Raid will be included in the future (Guess Which one).\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Durotar\u00a0</strong>has a completed story and will work as a microcosm of the world at large.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The game follows the traditional 2d style approach we are all familiar with and supports both keyboard and mouse and Gamepad.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Classic\u00a0</strong>tropes such as\u00a0<strong>quests</strong>\u00a0are present and litter the world. Some important, others not so much, but all of them work together to present a living world that doesn't necessarily need the hero to thrive.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Combat\u00a0</strong>utilises the amazing Action Battle System Plugin by AlphaABS. No longer do you have to wait between encounters and fading screens. All your enemies are there in front of you. Utilise the Skill system to defeat your enemies and consume helpful items on our road to glory.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story so far...</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The current iteration of the Demo allows the player to fully explore the first area of\u00a0<strong>Durotar\u00a0</strong>known as the\u00a0<strong>Valley of Trials</strong>. There you will uncover a growing plot and discover friendly and not so friendly npc's. Fight the Burning Blade and exterminate Boars and Cobras, all in the name of the orcish way!\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Explore!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Explore the land of Durotar, defeating foes and\u00a0<strong>fishing\u00a0</strong>small and medium fish on your way. A lot of detail has been given into making every location feel similar to those seen in World of Warcraft. Talk to the natives and make friends thanks to clever event scripting, number crunching and soul crushing text writing.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Fight</strong>\u00a0With allies in dungeons and uncover the hidden secrets and Loot that they hoard.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Manage\u00a0</strong>your inventory and wealth or spend it all on uncommon, rare or epic upgrades through the (in progress) Auction system.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Craft\u00a0</strong>upgrades or Fish your way to glory.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>What are you waiting for?\u00a0<strong>Download\u00a0</strong>the Demo at: https://marino13.itch.io/aze-rpg\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Join\u00a0</strong>my discord and personally talk to me at: https://discord.gg/p6KJqZ2u\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>All\u00a0<strong>Criticism\u00a0</strong>is welcome. The game is currently actively being worked on and troubleshooted by me. It will be provided for free through all the iterative updates as well as the finished product. As you can see this is an ambitious project, as such work on it is slow and methodical as I have to balance work and personal matters as well. Full Completion of the game will come slowly but steadily.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Pssst.... hey there! :D</p>\n<p><strong>Cinematic Trailer :\u00a0</strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YITDyg5Rgos\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:37:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f0/4f03651286aa1751b0c5d97128c69c02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarinoMan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
