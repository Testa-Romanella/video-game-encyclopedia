Unlike many other car games, which often focus on fast sport cars, here you'll be able to enjoy a true wagon, whose purpose was not to race, but to carry a lot of stuff and be cheap.\u00a0<strong>BUT</strong>, who said you have to use the car according to it's purpose? This game lets you experience driving in a car, with an almighty 90HP engine, and a max speed of 162km/h (allegedly).\u00a0</p>\n\r\nWhat makes this game better than many other crap games?\r\n<p>The main feature of this game is multiplayer!<br/>That's right! <strong>You can play this game with friends, and drive your Dacias together!\u00a0</strong>You can race, play carball or just mess around! Anything can be fun with friends!<br/><br/>Aside from that, this game also supports custom textures. But what does it mean?<br/>Well, basically, if you can use any graphical program and a notepad, you can easily <strong>make your own texture pack, and use it in multiplayer</strong> with your friends!</p>\n\r\nWhat is planned for the future?\r\n<p>I plan to not improve stuff currently in the game, but also add something new, for example new gamemodes or maps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nBut why? Why even make a game about a car like this?\r\n<p>The answer to that is simple - I have a Dacia car, and I wanted to make a game with my car. Besides, not many other games feature cars of this class, ain't I right?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nSo... what are you waiting for? <br/>Download the game and check it out!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T05:52:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/190/190add5968d165f1239a68e7004069e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oskiek"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
