People stopped taking money for garbage collection, companies that cleaned garbage before went bankrupt and closed. And people don't want to pay money for the export, because it has become so expensive that they have better worries. And only volunteers save the city by cleaning playgrounds, parks, squares.

He does not die, but falls ill and lies in bed. The main character decides that his son's life is more important than money, time and everything else. He doesn't want anyone else to get into this situation.<br/></p>\n<p>The player will have to take control of a volunteer whose task is to clean the streets of the city from garbage, restore its ecosystem.
