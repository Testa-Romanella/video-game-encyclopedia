mature in nature, so I shall not link them with this safe demo.\u00a0 However, all the characters in this demo DO appear in all my massive lore.\u00a0 I will be writing safe for all ebook versions of the novels eventually, so if you are young and want to learn about the lore, you will be able to!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Live Dev Question and Answer</strong><br/><br/>Next Q&amp;A is scheduled for Dec 6th at\u00a07pm\u00a0Eastern/6 Central/5 Mountain/4 Pacific time</p>\n<p>https://picarto.tv/TheAnax<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Full Game Overview</strong><br/><br/><strong>Greetings, it is I, The Anax, and this time I bring you my very first video game!\u00a0 For months, my programmer, BlankSubroutine has wanted to keep the gameplay of this title secret, but finally, a year after our first discussions, we are proud to show it off!\u00a0 The video above goes into detail, but this thread will also have information and be updated on future builds.\u00a0 The demo will be a rough draft (though as you will see even for something so rough it is of immense quality), and since this will be so expensive to make, how far this project gets relies on how much interest/income I am able to muster (as Blank programmed the demo for free, but will be a contracted employee on the main project, so I will need to pay him for work).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The first Anaxverse game is a \"match three\" game where one matches colored gems.\u00a0 These, in turn, will grant the character power.\u00a0 Once the correct requirements are met, the player can unleash the power as an attack on their enemy.\u00a0 The key is to keep your resistance above zero while bringing your opponents to nothing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>However, those with skill will want to meet the criteria needed to convert the enemy into one of your own minions!\u00a0 For example, if one is playing as the succubus Dionyza and they manage to get the opponent to gain two \"seduced\" debuffs, and then manage to break the right gems, they can cast Lillith's Love which would defeat the foe.\u00a0 What would follow is a conversion/transformation scene where the player's character uses their powers to warp the enemy into their own ilk.\u00a0 (The demo has a quick watered down version of this to show the proof of concept)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Replayability:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Due to the nature of the mind control, corruption, and transformation abilities of the characters in this project the replayability is vast!\u00a0 Imagine any given character from my Anaxverse.\u00a0 Let us say, Justine Day.\u00a0 Now, imagine not just as Slugs and Bugs version of her, but an undead Justine, a\u00a0cereborg\u00a0Justine, succubus, reptilian, shadowed, and the list goes on.\u00a0 By fighting through the game on one character, the player has the chance of converting that character into the same faction that it belongs to.\u00a0 Then, in a future run, the player could select the newly unlocked version of the other character and go through the game again to see all new scenes, stories, and unlock other versions too!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Adult Content:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This version of the demo has NO ADULT material.\u00a0 There will always be two versions of this game, an explicit, mature version, and this safe for all version.\u00a0 If you are interested in playing the adult version which contains nudity and sexual content, you will need to find and download it instead.\u00a0 I feel everyone should be able to enjoy my games, so it is worth the effort to make two versions!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Story/Lore:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So far my novels number well over half a million words and are still growing.\u00a0 This game will be relatively easy to follow in the story, but the Factions have huge amounts of lore gleaned from my novels.\u00a0 Easter eggs will abound, and strategies and knowledge from my massive story projects will be found in every level of Factions: CoC.\u00a0 So, if one ever wanted to get further information, they could find an immense amount of character, location, and attack information in my novels.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Blank and I will also be holding occasional developer question and answer sessions, so check my blog,\u00a0patreon, and the Hypnopics gallery to look for those.\u00a0 If I am able to gain enough income, this project will become huge!\u00a0 There will be a Faction for everyone!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Factions/Starting Character IN FULL GAME:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There will be male and female.\u00a0 (For those that like it, there will even be possible ways for doing M to F transformations in some cases too- no promises but if I can earn the income, I don't see why not!\u00a0 If the player wants to choose that on some scenes), however, as far as just male and just female- every Faction has one of each.\u00a0 Factions, themselves, work with two main characters.\u00a0 When you are going through the game fighting them, one of the two will be a \"mini-boss\" halfway through the map, and the other will be the \"boss\" at the end.\u00a0 As of right\u00a0now\u00a0it should be:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Faction Name: Female / Male</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Invaders: Justine Day/Overmind</strong><br/><strong>Giggle Gang: Trixie Goodwin/Giggler</strong><br/><strong>The Shadowed: Evelyn Addams/Me</strong><br/><strong>Nergalian Demons: Karen/Bo Wyatt</strong><br/><strong>Lilin Demons: Dionyza/Walter Riley</strong><br/><strong>Aka Manian Demons: Getty/Aka Manah</strong><br/><strong>Ophidian Demons: Eleanora/Ophion</strong><br/><strong>Undead Horde: Absinthe/Ivor</strong><br/><strong>Cereborgs: Chieko Naru/Cerebrum</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So, as the player, if I make enough money to make this game, you would choose which of these starting characters to play as and then go through the game as that character.\u00a0 So, every Faction WILL have a playable male or female protagonist that you can play as with unique conversion scenes/dialogue just for them.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image":
