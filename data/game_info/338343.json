You must play through different rooms that each contain puzzles. Solve the puzzles and work your way to stop the mysterious aliens on board.</p>\n\n<p>Note From Developer: This game is still in development.\u00a0This is my first game ever. On top of working a full time job I'm a father and a husband. I really enjoy games and I've always wanted to make them for myself. This project has been 1 week of learning Aseprite and GbStudio. I've loved every second of it.\u00a0\u00a0I'll be expanding on it a lot more if you're interested. Thank you for taking the time check out my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcdcc2710751ce5a3420a8eb020cac78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gorbles Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
