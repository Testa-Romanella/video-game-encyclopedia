It is a runner game in which you will have to overcome different obstacles on your way to the top of Mount Fuji.</p>\n<p>Our game is a metaphor for the cycle of life, represented by 3 levels (Spring Level, Autumn Level, and Spirit Level). After each level, you will have to decide if you are going to continue the trip by yourself or you rather stop and be part of something else.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>How to play:</strong></li></ul>\n<p>At the start of the game, you will control a carp\u00a0with 3 stats: Size, Velocity and Health, all of them with random values.</p>\n<p>Your mission is to avoid the obstacles and reach the lake at the end of each river section.\u00a0There, you will have to decide whether to continue or reproduce with another carp to improve your stats. If you choose to reproduce you will restart the game with your child. If you die with a Gen. 3 child, you will respawn with a random Gen. 1 carp with random stats.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- River controls:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Move the carp: A / D</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Dive:\u00a0 Left Shift</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>- Lake controls:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Move and Select :\u00a0Left Click Mouse</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>- General:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Pause: Esc</p>\n<ul><li><strong>List any content that was created before the jam that was included in the final submission</strong></li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>- Models:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Turtle Shell (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sculptjanuary18-day-25-shell-c4ae6ed7e50f44fb8db...)
