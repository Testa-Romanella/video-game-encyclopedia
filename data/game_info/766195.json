Your thirst must be quenched or you will fall victim to your fever. Quench your thirst by killing people in a small town and consuming blood vials. You may pick up weapons off your victims which can boost your attack damage and attack rate. Hide in pots or go to the forest to evade attackers. Learn your enemies schedules to find the opportune time of attack. Some enemies are stronger than others so you must strategize who your first victims may be. You only have two options kill or be killed.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ol><li>Move:\u00a0 WASD</li><li>Interact/Pickup: F</li><li>Attack: Space /\u00a0Left Mouse</li></ol>\n<p>Developers: Ryan Carpenter &amp; Khoa Nguyen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T14:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0c/b0c8ef53ec3f1ad1be5469ad2b785d4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaDness1184"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
