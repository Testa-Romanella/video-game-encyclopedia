I do have plans to continue this at some point, but with the help of a co-dev.<br/><br/>It's empty, buggy, and you might get stuck in a couple places, so please keep this in mind. Any suggestions or requests for more content, please e-mail me (eco) at ecojak777@gmail.com.<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/>ARROW KEYS - move<br/>z - interact (tap twice to speed through dialogue)<br/>x - default rpgm menu and backspace<br/><br/>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:<br/>- Extract the .zip and navigate to Game<br/>- RTP data is included, but if you still run into issues running the .exe, try downloading the free RPGmaker VX Ace demo off the Steam page. If that doesn't work, contact me at ecojak777@gmail.com and we'll work something out.<br/><br/>Music and wolf alternate sprite by RainbowCemetery:\u00a0https://rainbowcemetery.itch.io/<br/>https://www.patreon.com/RainbowCemetery/posts<br/>https://twitter.com/RainbowCemetery<br/><br/>Please consider helping me financially by donating upon download, or becoming a patron here!<br/><br/>KO-FI:\u00a0https://ko-fi.com/A2867QZ</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:29:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/035/035175956fb9224531f31004a0f96517.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vulture Party"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
