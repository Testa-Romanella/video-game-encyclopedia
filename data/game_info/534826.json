It's time for you to leave and plant new roots.</em></p>\n<p>Vinekid is a momentum-based platformer inspired by difficult, room-based platformers. Armed with nothing but a grappling-hook vine, you have to walk, jump, and swing your way to the end of over a dozen rooms.<br/></p>\n<p>The source code for the entire game is available on GitHub. Feel free to play with it however you see fit! Full game credits are included in the game and repository.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Note: There is a known bug where the player flickers in and out for... some reason. If this happens try running the GLES2 build instead.</em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85ad5338f9d8288c1cd98cc80421de10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sciman101"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
