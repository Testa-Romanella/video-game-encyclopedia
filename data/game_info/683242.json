We love Co-op games that allow for more than 4 players even more. <br/><br/>We also think it's important to bring VR and Desktop players together because it could still be a while before everyone has access to high quality VR hardware.<br/><br/>Finally, we are children of the 80's, so if you're into 80's &amp; 90's Sci-Fi / Horror, we hope you'll love what we have in store for you in this game.<h3>| Notes from the Developers Xtian &amp; JesV |</h3><br/><br/>We put a lot of value in the feedback of our users, and we want to hear what you think would improve the game. One of our favorite aspects of this process is getting a request for a change that would make the game better, and showing it off to the person who made the suggestion.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering trying out this game while it's in its prototype phase. We were lucky enough to have Valve give us access to their new \"Playtest\" feature on Steam, so if you want to try the game right now for free you can, and we'd LOVE to have you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T03:07:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/7593629aa8f70ef99cb54a637d4e4b35.jpg", "website": "http://www.voyagervr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 490, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VoyagerVR"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VoyagerVR"], "esrb_rating": null}
