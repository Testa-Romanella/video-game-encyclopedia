I made this game over ten years ago but I think it&#39;s still a pretty good game. It&#39;s more difficult than most of my other games, so this is not for casuals.<br />\nThis is from an older build of the Clickteam series so it requires a certain dll file to be present in the same directory as the game. The dll file is included in the zip, so just extract it to the same directory as the exe, and the game will work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-27T00:56:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df78c3838eb8724ecce77091b697bf98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scott Cawthon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Scott Cawthon"], "esrb_rating": null}
