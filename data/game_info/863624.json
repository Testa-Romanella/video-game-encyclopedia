Our approach started with trying to use python to make a simple demo game to use in our demo video. We used pygame to understand how the game would work and made our first level. Afterward, when we wanted to add more functionality, we realized that our code was unorganized and unclean, so we decided to work on the video first, and remake the game in Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T22:35:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e88/e88a62323f9ca84d14798aa7722ae1a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["xingruichen2@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
