Please take some time to fill out the feedback form found linked at the bottom or provide bug reports/polish ideas\u00a0:)</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>At Menace Labs you will be given charge of a clone. This clone will be allocated a goal that will have to be reached within its lifespan of 6 days. Upon completion of the goal, it will be freed to live out the remainder of its days as a successful clone. The Menace Director will be monitoring the clone's performance and stress levels so it can adjust the environment and send the clone for tests to ensure true success.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You will be able to direct the clone by clicking on some objects in its quarters. Aim to keep its needs high and improve its skills as quickly as possible as these will have an impact on both the Director's actions and the success of any tests the clone is sent to.</p>\n\n<p>The following links will take you to Google Forms.<br/></p>\n<p>Feedback Form: https://forms.gle/ZmGYvCY4z9oypSoBA<br/></p>\n<p>Bug Report: https://forms.gle/iCjAAPPnSDJE6CRS8<br/></p>\n<p>Polish Ideas: https://forms.gle/REMEMEAQbmTKQY6V7<br/></p>\n<p>More About Menace Labs: https://www.dominiquerussell.co.uk/menace-labs<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T14:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc3/bc39ab14a3f7fc39816f80d96ca9ffee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuncloudEntertainment"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
