{"id": 697068, "slug": "yags-falling-for-you", "name": "YAGS: Falling For You", "name_original": "YAGS: Falling For You", "description": "<p><strong>YAGS: Falling For You</strong> is a YAGS-universe game\u00a0created for BaraJam 2021.</p>\n<p>It consists of two distinct portions: A traditional visual novel and a puzzle-y minigame. The two portions are completely separate, and are enjoyable independently.</p>\r\nThe Visual Novel\r\n<p>The VN portion of the game\u00a0is a direct followup to the secret route in Yearning: A Gay Story. As such, it is strongly\u00a0 recommended that you either play through the route first or watch a YouTube LP of it (I recommend Chloe Spencer).</p>\n<p>(If you haven't completed even a single YAGS playthrough yet, definitely do that first. YAGS is free!)</p>\n<p>The visual novel features:</p>\n<ul><li>23.8k words</li><li>Censored male nudity and explicit gay male\u00a0sex (uncensoring patch\u00a0and censoring option\u00a0available)</li><li>2 CGs (by the talented Deevilj)</li></ul>\r\nThe Puzzle Minigame\r\n<p>The puzzle minigame requires no prior knowledge of YAGS (or ZAGS) and does not tie in to the universe at all other than utilizing art of the same characters.</p>\n<p>The minigame involves stacking Tetris-like blocks to fill the top row of a varying-sized grid. All puzzles are deterministic, non-timed, and infinitely retryable, and all moves are undoable. It is intended to be a friendly spatial reasoning puzzle rather than a test of reflexes or quick thinking.</p>\r\nAdditional YAGS-verse Games\r\n<p>See the entire YAGS universe here, or check out the following games:</p>\n<ul><li>The original (free) game: Yearning: A Gay Story</li><li>The (paid) full-length sequel to YAGS: Zen: A Gay Sequel</li><li>Free click-and-drag minigames with unlockable VN scenes: YAGS: Booty Call</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T10:00:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fb/7fbf4752dd4fd02df94102d12c671928.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["bobcgames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
