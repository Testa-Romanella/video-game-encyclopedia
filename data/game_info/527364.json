But, the development will be continued anyway to develop fully completed game. Thank you for your time and have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p>You are a <em>space science engineer.<br/></em>Once, you look up to the Earth sky and thought:<br/>- Why we always shooting, exploding, trying to kill all unknown, like barbarians centuries and centuries ago?<br/>- Who knows, maybe in this asteroid or in piece of it, can be lyfe, just not the same life as we looking.<br/>- What can I do to really start act as Human, and not from drilling and crashing all around, but carefully testing and studying first?</p>\n<p>And then, you started experiment <em>Moon Defence</em>.<br/>The experiment, that purpose to scientifically defence moon settlement by shooting droids to night sky to\u00a0catch asteroids and go to study unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play and purpose</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Purpose - survive as long as you can.</li><li>How - you can use droids to catch asteroids and rover to load asteroids and droids to refuel Space Module (in center).</li><li>Every droid can be started from droid platform\u00a0\u00a0on the left corner (select platform and left click at any space, to deselect - right mouse click or left\u00a0click again at the platform)\u00a0<br/>Be careful: droids limited by quantity - 5pcs and\u00a0they are refueling some times in that platform!\u00a0</li><li>Rover in center can pick up droids and asteroids; also it is refueling at Space Module in center and automatically unloading loaded asteroids and droids.</li><li>Asteroid will fall every 7 seconds</li><li>Highscore remembers\u00a0 records for\u00a0any droids crashed and asteroids fell</li><li>And warning: all objects\u00a0\u00a0destroyable - it means that droid cannot fly through droid - it will crash it. Rover cannot just move through droid - it will need load it or it can also explode. Asteroid can beat droids and rover and all buildings, so be careful.</li></ul>\n<p>Live long and prosper \\/ :)</p>\n<p><strong>Control</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button -\u00a0</strong>select/deselect droid platform, select/deselect droid, select/deselect rover\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Right Mouse Button</strong> - deselect all selected objects</p>\n<p><strong>Tab on top left\u00a0corner</strong> appears to choose positions\u00a0 to land asteroid, to droid platform and orbit position.</p>\n<p><strong>Tab on top right corner</strong> has information about debug tools and current highscore and droid limitation.</p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs</strong></p>\n<ol><li><ol><li><strong>Bug: </strong>Sometimes energy field around droid suddenly is not working, what to do</li><li><strong>How to solve</strong>:\u00a0Select the droid and click\u00a0button \"reboot power\" at the right\u00a0 tab.</li></ol></li><li>\n<ol><li><strong>Bug:\u00a0</strong>Droid and rover waypoints do not resetting if droid was selected and crashed.</li><li><strong>How to solve</strong>:\u00a0 Unfortunately this bug is not handled, please reboot game entirely, restart button in menu will not help:(</li></ol></li><li>Sometimes droid and asteroid suddenly disappear -\u00a0 reason unknown yet.. maybe\u00a0 \u00a0by UFO:))</li><li>Droids on air information doesn't updates correctly when droid crashes. That unfortunate, but will be solved.</li><li>Toogles in Droid waypoint window is not working correctly, use right text.</li></ol>\n<p>Very welcome to any comments and ideas\u00a0 !</p>\n<p>Thank you again!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T10:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c00/c008468bfb9be6db2ec6a95c0cb10584.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["arenukvern"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
