You've created a list of things you want to do before you go, one of them being to finally tell your crush your feelings. But for that to happen, you'll have to get into a party she's attending, and the party is being thrown by your high school rivals. Chaos, drama, fun, and hilarity ensue when you do everything possible to get into the party and complete your ultimate task. Multiple choices and paths are possible, but all roads lead to the lesson of a lifetime.\u00a0 Will you play it safe or take a risk in hopes of having the best last day ever?
