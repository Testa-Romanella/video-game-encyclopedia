This project is a product of my need to learn more about Godot and GDScript and level design in general. And even though it's serves as my playground to try new things, in the end the priority is to have something that is fun to play. Hopefully the project will serve as a learning tool for others as well.</p>\n<p>The game contains seven levels with various gameplay elements. The first playthrough can take 15 - 30 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD \u2013 movement<br/>Spacebar \u2013 dash<br/>Mouse \u2013 aim and shoot<br/>ESC/Tab - pause menu</p>\n<p>Please visit my Github page for complete source code.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T13:02:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e20/e20fb74df7c44373c8b3ae1d8e1347d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Paar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
