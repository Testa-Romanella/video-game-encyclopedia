{"id": 400290, "slug": "bus-simulator-2", "name": "Bus  Simulator", "name_original": "Bus  Simulator", "description": "<p>Your Bus. Your Route. Your Schedule.<br />\nWhether in the industrial or harbour zone, downtown, in the surrounding villages or the business park, in Bus Simulator, you experience up-close the exciting everyday life of a bus driver in a vast and freely drivable urban area. Get behind the wheel of your 8 original licensed city buses from the great brands of Mercedes-Benz, Setra, MAN, and IVECO and transport your passengers safely and punctually to their destinations, either solo in single player mode, or with friends in real-time multiplayer mode.</p>\n<p>As a bus driver in the 12 different districts, you\u2019ll face the challenges of the traffic in a big city and everything that entails. Don\u2019t be deterred by freak weather conditions, potholes, traffic jams, fare evaders, accidents, construction sites, night driving and specific passenger requests. On the contrary, take full control of your bus, earn money, gain a good reputation owing to your safe and punctual driving style and enjoy almost limitless driving pleasure in the authentic urban locations. Use the thousands of miles of virtual roads and streets to gain new districts, new buses and new customisation options.</p>\n<p>But drive carefully with the buses you build! Don\u2019t cause any damage or accidents and watch out for the speed cameras located around the city, or it could have a negative effect on your reputation, not to mention your wallet.</p>\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Your shift has already started!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T16:21:41", "background_image": null, "website": "https://www.bussimulator-game.com/buscon-en.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["stillalive studios", "Unreal Engine", "Astragon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
