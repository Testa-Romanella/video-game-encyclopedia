Once you\u00a0 posess them, you can unlock their true power with a demonic ability and an ultimate. Below are the different elements and their abilities.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fire</strong><ul><li>Primary: Shoot an explosive fireball</li><li>Demonic: Combust spontaneously and damage all surrounding enemies</li><li>Ultimate: Set an area in front of you on fire, dealing damage to any enemies in that area</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ice</strong><ul><li>Primary: Shoot an icicle that does a large amount of damage<br/>\n</li><li>Demonic: Set a mine that freeze enemies when it explodes</li><li>Ultimate: Shoot out a blizzard that freezes enemies that hit it<br/>(Frozen enemies move slower and take more damage)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Thunder</strong><ul><li>Primary: Zap the area in front of you with continuous bolts<br/>\n</li><li>Demonic: Dash briefly in the direction you're moving</li><li>Ultimate: Unleash a thunderstorm around you, damagine enemies in the nearby area</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rock</strong><ul><li>Primary: Fire a burst of rocks in random directions in front of you<br/>\n</li><li>Demonic: Create a moving wall that damages enemies and blocks projectiles</li><li>Ultimate: Construct a large circular walls that traps enemies in a small zone with you</li></ul></li><li><strong>Grass</strong><ul><li>Primary: Slash in front of you with a grass sword<br/>\n</li><li>Demonic: A large slash with a damaging claymore</li><li>Ultimate: Dash in a direction and slash in front of you, instantly killing any enemies in the way</li></ul></li></ul>\n<strong>HEALTH</strong>\n<p>The bar wrapped around the screen is your health. Due to your powerful demon presence, the monk you have posessed will begin to break down over time, and so your health will rapidly\u00a0decrease .</p>\n<p>BUT, its not all bad, you can posess a different monk and utilise their abilities, and deplete their health instead. Use this to your advantage and keep up the onslaught!<br/></p>\n<strong>ULTIMATES<br/></strong>\n<p>You'll notice a number in the corner, this is the number of ultimates you have. To gain ultimates, you must kill a certain number of enemies in a short amount of time. Each time you kill, the combo meter will go up, once its full, you gain an ultimate.</p>\n<p>Ultimates are truly destructive, and when combined together, you can unleash true havoc...</p>\n<p><strong>OTHER STUFF:<br/></strong>This game is still VERY rough around the edges, no sound, no sprites etc. I am planning to add a lot more to it, but will take a while cause I'm a busy guy lol. <br/><br/>But if somehow you find this page and can bare the long ass wall of text tutorial, feel free to leave a comment and criticise!<br/><br/>Source Code:<br/></p>\n<p>https://github.com/Enopa/Eradicate<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:37:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b39/b39a86a520ed0f0e1f4512e4ca2a76aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Enopa"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
