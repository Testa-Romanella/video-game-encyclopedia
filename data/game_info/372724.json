Human cities develop independently: peasants obtain resources, new buildings and troops are being built. From time to time, people gather troops and hike to other settlements.<br/>\r\n6) Karma. The dragon can participate in the life of every city. If the dragon sets fire to houses and kills ordinary people - the development of the city is inhibited, and the dragon\u2019s karma falls, but if it saves people from robbers and other monsters, then this helps the development of the city and its karma grows. Depending on karma, people will interact with the dragon in different ways. For example, troops will attack an evil dragon, but not good.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T14:41:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/211/21121783f696c0c06b7d18d801a838fc.jpg", "website": "http://elmarion.ru", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 17}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 473, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fleon Games", "Leonid"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fleon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
