Place musical elements, experiment around and create your own beats, rhythms and tunes. Play with the many possibillities and try out the countless combinations.</p>\n<p>From a randomly generated map, to big and empty maps to prebuilt maps, there are maps for every playstyle!</p>\n<p>This is an early prototype that I made for my Bachelor project at ZHdK in game design. I started around february 2022 and finished the first major milestone.</p>\n<p>Have fun creating your own tunes and share the game with others:)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T09:15:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31c/31cad2cc96153b8750f54ebf58d12546.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SBurckhardt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
