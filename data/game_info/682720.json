The game is a 3D puzzle game with a story, inspired by classic rhythm action games across the years.<br/>\nPart of the game concept is being a fictional character that can manipulate and use the \"spiritual power\" of various elements made of spiritual energy. This is done by adding an element of \"graphics\" to the game. In essence, the element of graphics allows for the player to have a bigger field of view and to have more control over these elements, thus making gameplay more fluid.\n\n\"A boy is born with a weird gift for activating elements within his body,\" says Outhouse Media's Executive Producer. \"Once he learns to use his power, the story changes, and the boy becomes more powerful than his surroundings.\"\n\n\n\"This was an excellent choice for the game because it is almost impossible to make a puzzle game that doesn't create a sense of possibility and adventure for players,\" says Outhouse Media's creative Director, Federico Schaefer. \"The moment we saw the game in action we knew we had a unique opportunity in developing a story that is accessible to all ages.\"\n\n\n\"I do a lot of work on stories for various genres,\" says Outhouse Media's Director of Production, Renato Colombo. \"A lot of my own work revolves around 'science fiction' themes, and Henry Game could easily take better advantage of that.\"\n\n\nSchaefer, Colombo, Schaefer, and Schaefer are excited</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:38:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69e/69e600cd326f58404e921eed8f54c86a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
