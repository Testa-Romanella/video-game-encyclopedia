THAT IS THE POINT OF IT**</p>\n<p>The game is obviously inspired by the big hit off, Among Us, and yes, I know the jokes died a while ago. Just trying to get something out there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play as familiar and funny characters! Choose nametags! Collect sprite cranberries!</p>\n<p>**MULTIPLAYER**</p>\n<p>to create a room so other people can join, click the \"Create Room\" button after choosing a name for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>to join another players room, just enter the same name they named their room, and click \"Join Room\".</p>\n<p>You can also just play solo by pressing create room. (new solo feature coming soon).</p>\n<p>Slendy Mungus! This game is still in it's very, VERY early pre-beta alpha stage.
