It isn't my first video game I made though as I made games over on Roblox.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong><br/>The goal is simple (For now anyways), it's to try to escape the house while trying to avoid your Father. To escape the house, you must find a key to unlock the front door to escape.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br/>this is pre-alpha, so try not get attached to anything in the game as it may change. As progress goes on, the game may take longer to beat, more ways to escape, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Horror</p>\n<p><strong>Kickstarter:</strong></p>\n<p>I have created a Kickstarter to help gain support. So help by supporting over there as well as sharing.</p>\n<p>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jonathanpecany/nightly-escape/description<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-18T01:19:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95b/95b23ff78bce769b4a362a57dbe9cdac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jonathanpecany"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
