You can also launch a multi-ball trigger when you wish.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis makes the game very different from the standard block-breaker, and you can play in a stress-free way to your heart's content.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nShuriken have a power level -- once the power fills up, you can launch piercing attacks that rip right through the blocks without bouncing back.<br/>\r\nUsing this power and the right timing, you can pierce through blocks and enjoy seeing the walls crumble before you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSelect from one of five playable characters!<br/>\r\nEach character has a unique Ninjyutu (ninja art) that can be used to further bust the blocks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce you get the handle of the controls, you'll enjoy the brisk feeling of breaking through blocks with reckless abandon.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80f5f7968e32217803b29d84b7ad44a0.jpg", "website": "http://www.geocities.jp/syuuyuusya/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["syuuyuusya"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["syuuyuusya"], "esrb_rating": null}
