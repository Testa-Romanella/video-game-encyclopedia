You must position your line to intersect with objects.</p>\n\n<p>Intersecting with the blue circle will give you a point. Intersecting with the red \"x\" will remove one point (so try to avoid it). The remaining two green icons are abilities. Intersecting with them will allow you to use them at any time. The clock gives you the ability to set the game to slow motion for 8 seconds. The reverse icon gives you the ability to change the direction of the circle.</p>\n<p>If your score drops to 0, the game ends. See how long you can last. How high can you get your score? Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:48:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c4/4c436a9936b21ee987b08383d498d50b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Brainiac Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
