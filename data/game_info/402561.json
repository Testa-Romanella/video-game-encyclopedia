The goal is to get the treasure of Blackbeard's Ghost by unlocking the last of 5 chests. Compete with the other pirates (controlled by an eccentric and about 25% broken\u00a0AI). To unlock chests, you must first get a\u00a0key, which is guarded by a monster. Don't get hit by the volleys of cannonballs fired from Blackbeard's ghostly galleon!<br/></p>\n<p>Press Z or space to swing your sword, and use the arrow keys or WASD to move. If you have a gamead plugged in, the dpad will move you and the A button will attack (or whatever A is mapped into on your gamepad if it's not an Xbox One controller). Escape quits.</p>\n<p>The original structure for this game is borrowed from an old children's board game released in 1991, called Ghostly Galleon, but it's now a real time action adventure type thing.</p>\n<p>The game was intended to have a lot more upgrades in the inn (which apply in a manner similar to Binding of Isaac) but I didn't have time, so there's only grog which increases your maximum health, costing 10 pieces of eight.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Music by Kevin McLeod</li><li>Sounds by soundbible</li><li>Any graphic that doesn't look completely awful was taken gratefully\u00a0from\u00a0https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-pirates-tileset</li><li>Framework by love2d</li><li>Everything else by me</li></ul>\n<p>Known problems</p>\n<ul><li>Frequent jitters.
