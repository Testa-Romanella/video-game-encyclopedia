It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board.  Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gobang may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.\r\nPlayers alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T04:16:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa5/fa5ecfda8808caef3400a2c671671d57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
