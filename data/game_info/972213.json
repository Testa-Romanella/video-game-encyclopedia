A planet for humanity to start a new life on. But when you awaken, you are already on the ground amongst the wreckage of your ship with no one else in sight. Stranded and surrounded only by debris, you start your journey under an unfamiliar sky.<br/><br/>The planet has a breathable atmosphere, which is a good start. Strangely enough, it is also already filled with plants and animals. The old seedlings from Earth must have survived the crash somehow. What happened to the ship? How long have you been frozen in cryo since your arrival? You don't have the answers, but...for now, you have more pressing concerns. You must find a way to survive and make this foreign planet your new home.<h3>Survive</h3><br/><br/>Face hunger, thirst, weather, and hostile fauna while the days pass by. Treat your wounds and keep your eyes open, some old machines still roam the landscape. The scorching sun above is unforgiving.<h3>Explore</h3><br/><br/>Discover various islands, underwater locations, old wrecks, and more. Find out what happened to your crew, where you are and what went so horribly wrong with your ship.<h3>Craft and build</h3><br/><br/>Harvest the resources of your new surroundings, refine materials and craft new tools. Find your way to the top of the food chain and build yourself a new home!<h3>Sail the sea</h3><br/><br/>Adjust the sails and follow the wind! Just like our ancestors sailed over the sea to discover new land.<h3>Gather electricity</h3><br/><br/>Scavenge the wreck and its remains, adapt the pieces to your situation as you build something new.<h3>Interact with the world</h3><br/><br/>Interact with several different types of workstations in a unique and immersive way to refine resources and take your next step forward. Instead of navigating endless menus, you physically interact in-game with your items.<br/><br/>For example:<br/> \u2022 Make cloth on a loom<br/> \u2022 Split wood into planks<br/> \u2022 Process raw hides into usable leather<br/> \u2022 Smelt ore into iron, and forge it into tools<br/> \u2022 Potter and fire clay into usable objects<br/><br/>...and more!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T07:00:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/615/615cc59b9c3813039349177fd2cf9ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["New Horizon Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["New Horizon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
