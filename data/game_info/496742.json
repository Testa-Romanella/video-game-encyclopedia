{"id": 496742, "slug": "kasi", "name": "Kasi", "name_original": "Kasi", "description": "Kasi is a simple game where you play as a plant. You start as a humble seed planted in the ground. You can create branches and leaves to collect sunlight, and roots to collect water. Having these in a good balance gives you energy to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou design the shape of your plant. You can go straight up and grow into a mighty tree, or you can stay low to the ground and be a nice hedge. You can grow vines which can snake along branches and across the ground. You can use regular leaves that collect sunlight, or special ones that collect moonlight. Growing flowers allows you to be pollinated and grow fruits.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe world around your plant is simple. The days lead into nights. Rain can fall and give you extra water. Birds come and go from your branches. The sun and moon move at different speeds, so sometimes there are eclipses. Stars can burst for extra light at night.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKasi is rendered without any texture art. Everything you seen on the screen apart from text is just colored shapes. The goal here is a minimalist aesthetic with only a small amount of visual flair.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T02:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/615/6159844c259612abafe5f4552474ae07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaikalii"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Kaikalii"], "esrb_rating": null}
