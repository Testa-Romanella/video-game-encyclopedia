Control Mort as you run and jump your way through short stages, collecting stars and powerup as you go.</p>\n<p>This very early technical demo with tons of <em>very placeholder</em> assets contains nine levels with a variety of movement based powerups to aid you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you've had fun with it, come hang out in the Mokuzai Studio Discord and share your thoughts as well as your run results!</p>\n<p>Development on this game started on January 28th 2023 and will hopefully finish before the end of the year. There's very obviously a lot to do, but I'm excited to share the current state of the game and get impressions and feedback from early players.</p>\n<p>Notes: There's currently no music, but I'll be working with the brilliant James Bennett. For now, please listen to the LOVE 3 soundtrack on repeat while you play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:58:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/410/410f9aaf8ad90c0874f3471467219325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fred Wood"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
