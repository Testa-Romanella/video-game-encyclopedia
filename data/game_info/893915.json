You must protect what's yours.</p>\n<p>You have made a place for yourself. You thought nothing could take it away from you. Now, they have come.</p>\n<p>Attack the agents of the\u00a0Dark and solve their mysteries. You must figure out why they're here, and why you are.</p>\n<p>The Dark has employed many agents to attack. Among these are:</p>\n<p>Knosins: These creatures will hide in darkness. You must click on them to send them away. They may also infect objects around you. You must click on these anomalies to get rid of them.</p>\n<p>Malthought: This yellow humanoid will appear near the same places as the Knosin, although less hidden. If you don't click on them, they will obstruct your view and make it easier for the Knosin to attack.</p>\n<p>Lava:\u00a0If there are meteors outside, click on the sky to get rid of them. Lava may also appear in doorways; click to get rid of it. If you don't, you will become slower.</p>\n<p>The Figure: If the room begins to appear white, you must click on the room. Otherwise, it will become hard to see.</p>\n<p>The Dark: You must click the Knosin that appears opposite of where he does. There will be many Knosins throughout the level, but only one is valid.</p>\n<p>This game is currently in alpha and only has the complete first level, with Knosins only.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T10:32:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/747/74775a3b67829e6139d51b2c9e76cc85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Qwertious"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
