Keeley is a manager in an accounting firm who recently kicked her husband out when she caught him cheating on her. Deeply hurt, she's now somewhat adrift emotionally.<br/>\r\nYou can play as two different characters with four main paths and a number of endings. The story is varied across the paths, hopefully providing enough variety that many different types of people will find something they like. While there is both story and sex in all paths, the focus is different for the two player characters.<br/>\r\nJames' paths are more focused on sexual situations. The story is less involved and the sex scenes are hard to miss. Your choices involve deciding whether James should regret his transgression and try to make amends with Keeley, while avoiding a lot of temptation, or whether he should enjoy his new freedom and have sex with as many people as he can.<br/>\r\nClaryce's paths are more complex and focus on story and relationship building. While there are steamy sex scenes here, you have to make the right choices and behave the right ways to get to them. It's much more possible to \"fail\" in these paths. Claryce is romantically interested in Keeley but will decide whether to try to be her friend or her lover.<br/>\r\nThere are 9 main endings spanning a variety of outcomes for Keeley.<br/>\r\nThere are over 20 explicit sex scenes of varying lengths.<br/>\r\nAnd there are over 1600 fully rendered images with complex backgrounds and extremely attractive characters.<br/>\r\nThis is an adult game which is not appropriate for minors nor for playing while at work.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T02:33:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/218e511f61f4f588ee4bcad681dabc80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 502, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tora Production"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Drunk Robot"], "esrb_rating": null}
