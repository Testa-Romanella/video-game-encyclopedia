If you try to hide, your energy\u00a0shield will slowly drain down to nothing and you will still die regardless. Try to get as high of a score as you can!</p>\n<p>This game is a one-man project (despite that typo in the main menu) and one made of passion. However, don't let that stop you from giving me feedback on every aspect of the game! Maybe something that I'm fine with fixing later is actually a super critical issue and I\u00a0just don't realize it as a developer!</p><p>Music by Waterflame - Lightspeed\u00a0<br/>Patch notes and future plans: -\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sZDLHZfDEMnJpJ5zhH38PQfSqjNBnhwpWzD9iypCKbY/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/21465abd6cfb339a716f0411e5192e58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DamienJS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
