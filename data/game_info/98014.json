The setting is the under ice sea on Jupiter's moon Europa. The bubbling mechanics were sort of inspired by Bubble Bobble.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt's playable but incomplete. After the jam the following will be updated:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>infinite scrolling background</li>\n<li>better collision detection</li>\n<li>flares/pulses to lure/repel certain fish</li>\n<li>powerups</li>\n<li>bosses</li>\n<li>max depth of 100km</li>\n<li>progressive difficulty</li>\n<li>more alien fish</li>\n<li>gfx polish</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tI'd like to give a big thank you to \r\n\tSophie Houlden for hosting the event and Andrew Anderson for creating a very cool MIDI to P8 music convertor tool.
