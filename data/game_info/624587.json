Each game shall have some focus on different topics, in this case, game-feel, difficulty, visual design. Furthermore, each game is some sort of experimental take on previously existing designs. In this case, a game in the style of the Binding of Isaac's Greed-mode with the progression system turned on its head. Other, more or less minor ideas I want to explore in this game are\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) Auto-difficulty -\u00a0the game adjusting its difficulty based on the way the player plays the game. This feature can be turned on or off at any time and the player stays in complete control.</p>\n<p>2) Multiple control-layouts - support for keyboard-only, mouse+keyboard and several gamepads (XBox 360/ONE, PS4, Nintendo Pro Controller) for directional input or twinstick-controls. I have yet to come up with a reliable way to implement control-remapping, though.</p>\n<p>3) Run-History - The game records all notable events in the game and plots them in a graph. <em>This is not implemented in the current version, yet.</em></p>\r\nHow to report bugs/give feedback\r\n<p>Any way you want, really. I'd prefer it if you wouldn't yell or cuss at me too much, but other than that, there are no wrong opinions and no unreasonable suggestions. However, it would help me a ton if you could be <strong>as specific as possible</strong> with everything you're addressing because otherwise it's really easy to misinterpret your criticism and miss the entire point of it.</p>\n<p>Please don't forget to include what OS you're playing the game on, which version of the demo and which controller-layout (keyboard only? PS4 Gamepad?). If you have issues with performance / framedrops or lags, it would be helpful to know about your computer's CPU, GPU and RAM.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>My twitter DMs (@meloonicscorp)\u00a0\u00a0are open and the comment section on this page works as well.</p>\n<p>I appreciate your support!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:37:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39b3da40ee6e191a178018bfb0df60fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["meloonics"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
