After the invasion of an unknown cake species from HE0450-2958, humanity was wiped out entirely. </strong></p><p>Witness the apocalypse as you play the last remaining human in a world that was devoured by high-calorie foods which came to meet the great Luciano Pavarotti but were utterly devastated by his passing, so much that they decided to let mankind disappear forever in a last, lavish banquet. Feel the hopelessness as you can do nothing but jump, run or... fall while trying your best to not get hit by the low-poly mesh. This diabetes inducing horror experience will implant a new fear into your mind: The fear of not having any salad.</p><p>You can move by using w,a,s, or d on your keypad and press spacebar to jump a bit. <br/></p><p>This game was mainly created as an VR experience so it is more of a simulator... <em>I guess?</em> No, seriously, check out my art tumblr, I just made this for fun, I'm more of a drawing person. Email me for game concept art requests! :) You may also send me cake or donate cakes. I'll help you save humanity by eating theeem.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/255/255b606b4d0c3d212ef71b1a9b6f605d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wei Wu"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
