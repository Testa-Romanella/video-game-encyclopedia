The game uses a chunk system to manage the simulation of huge factories in real time.</p>\n<p>Factory Farming's simulation performance has been check\u00a0on the Playdate hardware using a test factory with a total of 6,300 buildings, crops and\u00a0conveyor belts, and with 3,000 pieces of cargo moving around the facility on conveyor belts at any one time. Factories cannot grow very much larger than this due to the limited plot size.</p>\n<p>Moving around regions of a factory with lots of cargo in motion on conveyor belts can cause the framerate to dip.\u00a0This can be fixed by zooming in, which reduces the number of sprites which need to be rendered. Enable \"Auto Zoom-In When Moving\" from the settings menu to automate this.</p>\n<p>The latest version of <strong>Factory Farming (V1.0)</strong> is available for Playdate devices and the <strong>Playdate Linux Simulator</strong> (Compiled using: <em>Ubuntu Linux, x86_64</em>).</p>\n<p>Regular and NoMusic builds are available, the only difference is that the NoMusic build does not come bundled with a music folder in the pdx. This results in a substantially smaller download (390 KB instead of 19.5 MB).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game can be <em>Side Loaded</em> onto the Playdate - <strong>see how to do this here</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is a MIT licensed open source project, <strong>the full source is available on GitHub</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\nAsset Credits\r\n<p>With thanks to the following creators for releasing great assets under permissive licences!</p>\n<ul><li>Music<ul><li>Dr Tikov: <strong>1985 (8 Bit Chiptune Mix)</strong> [CC BY 3.0]\u00a0</li><li>BoxCat Games: <strong>B-3</strong> [CC BY 3.0]\u00a0</li><li>Eric Skiff: <strong>We're the Resistors </strong>[CC BY 3.0]\u00a0</li><li>RoccoW: <strong>Sweet Self Satisfaction</strong> [CC BY-SA 4.0]\u00a0</li><li>RoccoW: <strong>Weeklybeats 2014 #4 - All Will Be Well</strong> [CC BY-SA 4.0]\u00a0</li><li>Soft &amp; Furious: <strong>Horizon Ending</strong> [CC0 1.0]\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Art<ul><li>Kenney: <strong>1-Bit Pack</strong> [CC0 1.0]\u00a0</li><li>VectorPixelStar:\u00a0<strong>1-Bit Patterns</strong>\u00a0[CC BY-SA 4.0]<br/>\n</li><li>Varkalandar:\u00a0<strong>Assorted Isometric Rocks</strong>\u00a0[CC BY-SA 4.0]\u00a0<br/>\n</li><li>ScratchIO:\u00a0<strong>Farming Set (Pixel-Art)\u00a0</strong>[CC0 1.0]\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</li><li>josehzz:\u00a0<strong>Farming crops 16x16</strong>\u00a0[CC0 1.0]</li><li>withthelove:\u00a0<strong>Tiny 16: Expanded Character Sprites</strong>\u00a0[OGA BY 3.0]</li><li>InThePixel: <strong>Fantastic Fence 16x16</strong> [CC0 1.0]\u00a0\u00a0</li><li>DinosoftLab: <strong>New icon from the Noun Project</strong> [CC BY 3.0]\u00a0</li><li>Shepardskin: <strong>House sets</strong> [CC0 1.0]\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Fonts<ul><li>Chester Jenkins: <strong>Cooper Hewitt</strong> [OFL 1.1u3]\u00a0</li><li>Martin Vacha: <strong>Roobert</strong> [Playdate Fonts licenced under CC BY 4.0]\u00a0</li><li>Mediengestaltung: <strong>Messing Lettern</strong> [1001Fonts FFC]</li><li>Mediengestaltung: <strong>Coventry Garden</strong> [1001Fonts FFC]\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Sound Effects<ul><li><strong>sfxr.me</strong></li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T08:04:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cd/6cd29dc67a3133e86294fbb476654bd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["timboe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
