Wrath of the Bony Boys is a parody horror game made by a group of 5 third-year students. The game creates the spooky feel with the visual design of the post processing and the glowing eyes, and then the audio design of the ambiance and the noise of the skeletons. Then the parody/comedy was created by the concept and the movement of the things chasing you, flopping all about.</p><p>Team Members:\u00a0<br/>Simon Demirjian (\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-demirjian-5a52a2171/\u00a0)<br/>Adam Hall (\u00a0https://people.rit.edu/ash5572/portfolio/\u00a0)<br/> David Patch (\u00a0https://dop4398.github.io/\u00a0)<br/>Drake Richards (\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/drakerichards/\u00a0)<br/>John Vance (\u00a0https://people.rit.edu/jmv7411/230/portfolio/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T02:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae1/ae1b2fdd87d0f83fea69b7ce16cae800.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BigBearGDD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
