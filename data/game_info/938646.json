It manages and controls the climate, resources, energy, and everything else on the earth, and has brought peace of mind to people's lives for a long time since its birth. Everyone was satisfied with their world, and even thought it would last forever.</p>\n<p>One day, however, that illusion was shattered so abruptly and easily. It was by the hand of none other than Sol himself.</p>\n\n<p>[Character]</p>\n<p>-Pilot (Player)</p>\n<p>A member of the world's only remaining manned aircraft combat unit, and an ace among them with exceptional abilities.</p>\n<p>He is loyal to the organization and believes that the reason for his existence is to carry out his mission, even at the risk of his own life.</p>\n<p>He is ruthlessly faithful to the orders he is given, and appears to be no different from a machine.</p>\n<p>-Alpha</p>\n<p>Alpha is an exact copy of Sol. When Sol loses control and is extremely difficult to repair, it \"overwrites\" itself with Sol by physical forced access from the outside and returns everything to its initial state.</p>\n<p>During combat, it plays an important role in supporting the pilot by linking with the ship, as well as protecting the ship from hacking and jamming from Sol.</p>\n\n<p>[Terms &amp; Disclaimer]\r\n</p>\n<p>Secondary distribution prohibited.
