{"id": 2936, "slug": "anomaly-korea", "name": "Anomaly Korea", "name_original": "Anomaly Korea", "description": "<p>Anomaly Korea is the second game in the Anomaly series of tower offense (that is, a reverse tower defense) games. It has very few differences from its predecessor, the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Anomaly Korea takes place in the future, after an alien attack that devastated much of the Earth. The invaders landed their ships on our planet and are protect them with heavy fortifications. The player assumes the role of a commander of an armored squad that tries to penetrate the alien defenses. As its name suggests, this installment of the series is set in Korea.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay didn&#39;t change much since the previous Anomaly installment. The player controls a group of armored units in real time. The number of units is limited, and there are no options to produce more, so the player has to keep his or her units safe. There is a limited number of boosts the player can use to improve a unit&#39;s health or attacks. </p>\n<p>Anomaly Korea includes twelve levels in its campaign mode. The primary goal of each level is usually to eliminate the defense towers that protect the alien base. One of the few notable improvements in Korea, besides better graphics, is the variety of its missions. They can include objectives like destroying a specific number of enemy towers or protecting a peaceful convoy on an escort mission. The game also introduces a new mode called Art of War that offers the player a set of more difficult missions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T12:11:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/853/853475c28e65ff1c50422e1316dbc5a8.jpeg", "website": "http://www.anomalykorea.com", "rating": 2.53, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 63, "owned": 1396, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 13, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 49, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 49, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["11 Bit Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["11 bit studios", "Chillingo"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
