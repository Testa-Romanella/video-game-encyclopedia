Game guide: just put an instruction page in the settings, as a non-traditional personal game, there is no game guide, it depends on the player to read the instructions, rubbish design.<br/>2. Network service: As a multiplayer game, there are many defects in the network layer, there are some bugs in the lobby, and the connection is inexplicably dropped.<br/>3. UI design: The interface UI can only be said to be barely usable, but the legibility of the in-game UI is poor and unqualified.<br/>4.
