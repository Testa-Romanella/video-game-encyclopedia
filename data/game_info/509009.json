For games based on groups of characters larger than 4, this default setting is very inconvenient.</p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong>This script allows the developer to increase the number of battle participants to 12.</p>\n<p><strong>Script configuration: </strong>It is necessary to configure the maximum number of characters that will be displayed inside and outside the battle.</p>\n\n<p>This script is very simple and has no objective of causing profound changes in the battle system of the RPG MAKER MZ. Precisely for this reason it has a high level of compatibility with other plug-ins.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attention: </strong>If you want to combine this plugin with my other plugin: POG_FormationControl, instead use the POG_FormationControlEX plugin, which already has this plugin \"embedded\" in it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Extra function: noBattele (the power of love)</strong></p>\n<p>It is possible to prevent some characters from the group from entering the battle. For this you must:</p>\n<ol><li>Set up a Status in the database to assign to the characters that will be left out of the battle.</li><li> To configure the Status, just insert the <strong>&lt;noBattle&gt;</strong> tag in the <strong>Note</strong> field of the Database Status tab.</li><li> Assign the Status configured with the <strong>&lt;noBattle&gt;</strong> tag to the characters who are out of the battle.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Attention: </strong>If all the characters are unable to engage in combat this can cause problems during the course of your game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daa/daadb85c11a04856dc6cd9aece823837.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TecnoAnalogica"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
