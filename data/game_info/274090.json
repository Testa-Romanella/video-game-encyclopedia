Colorful and bright, they\u00a0would be perfect, except they don't have legs. Luckily they have a friend in Purple, who carries them around on its head.</p>\n<p>Although Purple likes to visit the scary, old forest to collect shiny objects, its jelly passengers are not afraid. Their friend would never put them in danger after all.<br/><br/><strong>This game is a puzzle-platformer\u00a0in which you explore the forest, find all the stars and hardly ever\u00a0throw your jelly companions into lava. Have fun!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/805/805579aa8259b91df6ddeee0650ec474.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["auxiliaryCarry", "Tommy", "chrissx2", "Veka"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
