Pick up magical scrolls to unlock colored energy barriers. But watch out for the red spiderbots! They only move when you move, so you'll need to use strategy and your own lengthening worm body to outwit and block them. Or you can just ram them with an energy sphere to blast them to bits. Either way, it will require a great deal of strategy and puzzle solving to make it down to the very lowest levels of the Hogoworm Dungeon!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures include:<br/>\r\n* Over 100 levels of increasing difficulty<br/>\r\n* Fluid animation<br/>\r\n* Full support for either mouse/keyboard or game controller", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T03:01:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d49472e727cc21b948fdf33c3f256f73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hogo Company"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hogo Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
