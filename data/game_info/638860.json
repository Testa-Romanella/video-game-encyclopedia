She explains that each one of them has recently suffered a massive loss in their life, but that she has\u00a0</em><em>invited them here,\u00a0to the <strong>Astral Casino</strong>, as contestants in a game. She reveals a sparkling coin, and promises that if they can obtain one, they can undo the pain they\u2019ve suffered and make their lives whole again.</em></p>\n<p>In this demo you'll experience most of\u00a0the first two days of the game. Deck building is not present in the demo, and tutorials are not implemented. The game is at an extremely mixed level of overall polish. Nonetheless, we hope you enjoy it!\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Explore the <strong>Astral Casino!</strong></li><li>Talk to your fellow contestants!</li><li>Engage in card-based combat!</li></ul>\n<p>This was made over the course of four months\u00a0as our final project in the Dawson College\u00a0IVGD program. The current version (1.03)\u00a0is reflective of our final submitted build for the class and was firmly a work in progress, so expect imperfection!</p>\n<p><strong>The project is currently on indefinite hold as we reassess its needs and our ability to reach them. We will be working on other projects to gain experience and raise funds in the interim.</strong></p>\n<p>Made by:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Game Direction and Production<ul><li>Liam Allen-Miller -\u00a0@RSSLiam</li><li><li>Programming</li></li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Jamie Javadi -\u00a0@_jamiejams\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Pascal Lambert -\u00a0@pascall2</li></ul>\n<p>Art Team</p>\n<ul><li>Liam Allen-Miller -\u00a0@RSSLiam<br/>\n</li><li>Phil Dragash -\u00a0@PhilDragash</li></ul>\n<p>Audio Team</p>\n<ul><li>Aaron Scott<br/>\n</li><li>Antoine Martin -\u00a0SoundCloud<br/>\n</li><li>Philippe Tanguay -\u00a0Facebook\r\n</li><li>Val\u00e9rie LF -\u00a0Facebook</li></ul>\n<p>Writing Team</p>\n<ul><li>@creamycomet</li><li>Liam Allen-Miller -\u00a0@RSSLiam<br/>\n</li><li>Jamie Javadi -\u00a0@_jamiejams</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T04:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/761/761784649845a924dc2ccfd793504fea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["liam allen-miller"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
