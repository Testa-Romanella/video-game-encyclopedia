As you progress through the rounds, more and more zombies will spawn. It's your duty to do your best to survive for as long as you can possibly go. I challenge you to get the highest score you can, good luck! In a later update, things such as powerups and newer enemies will be added so be sure to support the game if you did enjoy playing. This game was made for Mini Jam 76: Radiation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T03:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/185bb6f9355a931f4ec987d31b7ee2ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Draza"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
