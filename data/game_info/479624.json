I HAVE TO MEANS TO FIX THIS AT THE CURRENT TIME &amp; DUE TO THIS BEING A GAME JAM SUBMISSION CAN NOT SEND OUT A PATCH UNTIL AUGUST 22ND, 2020. UNTIL THAT TIME I ADVISE AGAINST USING RTX GRAPHICS CARDS ON THIS GAME, OR CHANGE YOUR SETTINGS TO LOW BEFORE ENTERING THE \"FINALE\" LEVEL.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a\u00a0Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2 Entry. As it is a game jam game made in one week solo, some performance hitches and bugs are expected. Please leave a comment detailing any/all issues so they can be fixed for a post-jam release. I recommend playing on\u00a0HIGH settings and then seeing if it performs well enough even on lower end hardware, because the second level (Guerilla) does not work well on lower settings.</strong></p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p><strong>Destroy the Past to Save the Future.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Alien androids are invading Earth's past to dominate the future. Rewind time to various periods in order to stop the invasion, and defeat their leader in the future before she can ever go back and enact her evil plan.</p>\n<p><strong>High Octane Action</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Taking inspiration from games such as Gears of War(TM), Dark Souls(TM) and Vanquish(TM), R3WiND is a fast-pace third-person shooter which heavily builds around dodging mechanics. Dodge your foes strikes with flawless timing and hit them where it hurts with a varied 3-weapons arsenal, unleash powerful, hard-hitting melee strikes and combos, and dominate your foes with Overclocked Mode, slowing down time for everything in the world except for yourself for dramatic, cinematic combat and high-speed dodges.</p>\n<p><strong>Available for\u00a0Windows and Linux</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n\n<strong>Key</strong><strong>Action</strong>WSADMovementSHIFTSprintSPACEDodgeLMBShootRMBAim down sightsSPACE + RMBBullet time1, 2, 3Switch weaponsESCAPEPause\r\n<p><strong>FULL PLAYTHROUGH:</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T11:28:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d35/d35043c1a5576d07e895fb503fe137e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Winnitude!"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
