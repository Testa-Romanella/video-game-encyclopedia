This game is all about the player versus the game itself. Like Metroidvania games, Super Fight the Program is about learning the pattern of each enemy, and avoiding enemies and projectiles where necessary. Enemy and boss patterns are what build SFTP's difficulty, adding a modern kick to its lo-fi aesthetic.</p><p>I want you to work on this game with me! If you purchase an early access build of the game, you are getting access to shape the later builds of the game with me!
