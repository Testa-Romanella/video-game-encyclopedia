You will still kill it, but will suffer a health loss.</p>\n<p>Known issues:<br/>You can jump off screen. Keep track - and jump back on.<br/>No sound - play some music on your phone (bug in sound engine I couldn't work around in time)<br/>No end of game - when your health gets to 0, refresh.<br/>No animation.
