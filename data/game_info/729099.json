Except not in a sleigh, but with a sleigh-mobile! The next best thing.</p>\n<p>Help Santa deliver all the presents before everyone wakes up in this fast-paced, quick-reaction game!</p>\n<p>You can either do that in Story Mode...\u00a0or test out your skills in Free Mode!</p>\n<p>Free Mode offers 30+ customizable gameplay styles! Whether you want to take it slow and learn the mechanics of this game, plus tweak your\u00a0timing on your present throws, or go absolutely bonkers and really test your limits.\u00a0Though, be careful, as there are certain difficulty combinations that make this game genuinely impossible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heck, I even gave you the ability\u00a0to completely break the game and modify your automobile speed! Will your vehicle potentially go off-screen if you set it high enough?! Well yea, but that's because you chose to go down that path :)</p>\n<p>Unlock up to 5 additional automobiles when you complete Story Mode (in either Unlimited Lives Mode, or One-Life Mode for added difficulty). In addition to that, you'll\u00a0get an additional personalization surprise when you beat the game in each of those modes!</p>\n<p><strong>SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! </strong>Your next train/bus stop? Your food? Waiting for class to be over? If you said yes to just waiting for something in general, try this game out!! It's free, it's customizable, and most of all... it's now YOUR game!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Important Note Before Downloading The Android Version:</strong></p>\n<p>I should also state that if you plan to play this on your android phone, make sure it's updated... or use a phone that has decent hardware. My Oneplus 8 could run it, but my Samsung J3 Prime couldn't get past the splash screen. I'm currently working on a fix for that if possible. I'll let you guys know about that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T10:55:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1f/d1f1cfe06c3e459a6d9cdf04af4c94d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["TheReallyFake13Random"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
