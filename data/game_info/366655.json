Somehow. Now he has to find the super computer and destroy the whole thing to save humanity, but he'll have to find four keycards because the guys who made this stupid game said so... why am I going on with this? Just download the game and try it for yourselves, folks.</p>\n<p>I had to rush the game a bit since the rest of members were inactive and there wasn't any time left, unfortunately. Even then, I'm kinda proud of what I've done. Any completed jam is an important progress if you ask me.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Left/Right Arrows to move</p><p>Up Arrow to Jump</p><p>LShift to Shoot</p><p>Made in Godot 3.1 for LOWREZJAM 2019</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T05:19:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/788/7888e545a62aa69d5898b8e37f449a40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Regression"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
