In the end, we've decided it would be best to create a sort of \"intro\" for the game we wanted. That means that the game has 6 levels, in which you should learn some basics (how to use the Particle Gun, walking, jumping...).</p>Disclaimer:<p>1. This game is completely free. If you paid for it, 1) Thank you very much for your kindness, 2) it's your fault. <br/>2. The game is not in any way inspired by <strong>Portal</strong>, nor I have ever heard of anything like that.<br/><strong>3</strong>. It has been <strong>confirmed </strong>that blinking lights can trigger epileptic seizures. If you die because of playing this game, you shouldn't've played it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/225/225b1467ac71e4e82c226cd10628639d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["webik150"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
