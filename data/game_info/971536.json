Thus, I put it here)<br/>1, The game is made with a very old game engine. (For memories' sake)<br/>2, There is only one developer. <br/>3, I am terrible at 2D art.<br/>4, I am not a native speaker of English.<br/>Thus, I provide an honest demo for you. The demo version will update all the way till a certain story is finished. <br/>It reflects the current stage of game development in almost real-time.<br/><br/>If you find the game stopped updating for more than 14 days without any explanation, it's safe to assume I'm dead.<br/>In that case, do not buy the game.<br/><br/>As the game is one of the first and last RMXP games that's ever been developed, I'm not exactly aiming to make it something great. (or even sane.)<br/>Instead, it needs to be unique and fun in a way that people can rarely see nowadays, to make people laugh maniacally even in a grimdark world where both the in-game world and the life circle of RMXP are coming to an end.<h3>Story</h3><br/>Welcome to our secret society of [redacted]. We are among the most ancient ones in our line of work.<br/>For a long time, we have witnessed the rise and fall of many others. <br/>The situation is grim, the world almost ended in 2008, 2012, 2015, and 2020.<br/>Some people predict it will keep ending this year, next year, and the year after.<br/><br/>But, well, even if that's true, even if the ending is inevitable, it is tragic, we are still alive.<br/>So, cheer up! We shall carry on. <br/>As long as we stand, the world shall never fall!<br/>To the end...<br/><h3>Features:</h3><br/><strong>Unbalanced and Unfair</strong><br/>Beneath the facet of the beautiful life people called \"normal\", lurks the truth that this secret struggle is never fair.<br/>There are things that can hardly be killed. They may come in great numbers to overwhelm us.<br/>Even when not facing such a supernatural entity, a well-trained Kung Fu master can still be killed by just a bullet.<br/><br/><strong>But, We Fight on With All We Have! </strong><br/>We have guns and our own magic. We even learned to bind supernatural entities to our wills. <br/>We have tools and artifacts, we have skills ranging from combat to conversation.<br/>If there is a lock that can hardly be picked, try blowing it.<br/>There are always solutions.<br/>If not, may the butterflies preserve us.<br/><br/><br/><strong>You Are Different.</strong><br/>Your arrival was not expected. You were not on any lists. We know little about you.<br/>Show us, who you are and who you will become with all the perks/skills/proficiency you may develop.<br/>We may still stand a chance against all odds with your help. <br/>Lead us...<br/><strong>In This Vast World</strong><br/>Your loyal companions will follow you from ancient ruins to modern metropolis, from east to west.<br/>You will meet common folks we swear to protect, watching them live their \"normal\" life.<br/>You will discover mysteries, and solve them when combating evil forces lurking in the dark.<br/><h3>The Secret History</h3>The story behind this game:<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1519140/view/2986431641632413538<br/><br/>It's the first Neolithic game with English localization that comes to Steam since 2004 when the first game of Neolithic was published in a dark corner of China.<br/><br/> Compared to a commercial game, this is more like a memento to the old golden age of RPG Maker XP (when indie games are really indie; when updates are free instead of being paid DLCs; when developers update games for years, even decades instead of abandon projects as soon as it's no longer profitable; when games are made with passion instead of money-hunger; And, when RPG Maker was not used to just make those cheap adult-only games.) <br/><strong>This is NEOLITHIC!</strong><br/>There are many games out there, made with modern tools and more than 1 developer. They are supposed to be better than mine.<br/>But, they are not. Why? <br/><br/><h3>Unauthorized Edit Detected!</h3>We also have cats! They are cute. :3<br/><br/><br/>Something Silly: :P<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T19:22:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/1278d48e735bcaa37600a30b33e74956.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["orochi2k"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RMAsia", "orochi2k"], "esrb_rating": null}
