You must help the trees, clearing them of toxins, allowing them to re-bloom. <br/>\r\nGame Plumbing \"Toxic threat\" is of the long-known genre of \"plumber \", but you will be pleasantly surprised by the changes that bring variety to the gameplay. The game will be interesting for everyone from novices to pros. <br/>\r\nThe game has 20 levels, which differ: <br/>\r\n- Simple levels - which will help you to practice logic games and how to construct a pipeline. At these levels have no restrictions, can be long and hard to find the right solution;<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- For time \u2013 after simple training levels, we will complicate the task, now every level has a time limit, be careful while choosing the desired position of pipes, if time runs out, you have to start the level again; <br/>\r\n- With limited turn-out of pipes, can you easily cope with the levels on time ? Then let's complicate the task now each pipe can only be turned 4 times, after those it will break, be careful, because there are the pipes without which you can't force in to the correct path of the pipeline. In advance, think before you twist the tube and watch the time; <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Filter \u2013 and here are the new levels, now at level, there is a filter that separates the toxins into the water and poison. Here it is necessary to hold the pipe to the filter and from the filter to the pipe in two directions, clean water back to the tree, but the poison to collect in the barrel, also do not forget about the separation of turn-outs and time; <br/>\r\n-With different directions \u2013 and finally, the most difficult levels. Here you will have to think carefully, because the correct version of the pipeline is only one, you need to correctly make a plumbing, but at some point it will be split into two or even three directions, which extremely complicates task, and you shouldn't forget about the time and limitation of the turn-outs of the pipes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T14:25:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f55/f5523bec4f0a34d3d3e9e4890ff314b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 100, "beaten": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndieLip", "Dmitriy Uvarov"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IndieLip"], "esrb_rating": null}
