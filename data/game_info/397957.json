There for, if anyone wants to use my system, either their system need to change the object class or they need to rewrite the class name in my system even though the functionality is exactly same. and I wasn't expected that. If there is a chance to rewrite my system, I will make the class as template to make it flexible.</p>\n<ul><li>Your experience using someone else's engine system</li></ul>\n<p>The audio system I used for my game was very straight forward and\u00a0quit easy to use.\u00a0 There was a few\u00a0bug in an audio system, however the code was organized and I didn't have problem fixing up the issue.</p>\n<ul><li>Your experience making a game with your game object and graphics interfaces</li></ul>\n<p>Since the graphic engine is somehow overlap with my UI system, I need to work on small modification when I make a game which was a little bit annoyed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T03:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b95/b95362808deff22579842f4584d66951.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dropanddrop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
