Seems that she wants to play a game with you, then why not, no one hates a game, right?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let's take a tour at Tianfu Square, one of the largest shopping malls in Sichuan, China \u2014 a super mini version\u00a0though, which is good, after all, we need to\u00a0find Meili. Good luck.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is a student project created in Level Design Studio class at NYU Game Center. It has only one level, not much narrative, no menu.

(Do NOT delete the 2 bin files) It\u00a0will install the game with an excutable file and content packs. It's huge (UE4 is crazy!), so it may take up some minutes to fully install the game.</p>\n<p>When you complete\u00a0the installation process, click the <em><strong>FinalProject.exe</strong></em> file to run the game.
