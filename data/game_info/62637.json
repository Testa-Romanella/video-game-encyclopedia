Really? OK then... welcome to HIPSTER CAF\u00c9.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse your trust fund to buy up some old warehouse building in the run down part of town then market it to the nouveau riche in a cynical attempt to drive up property prices. Can you successfully navigate the shifting waters of pop culture in order to market your eatery to the wealthiest demographic?<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Optimise your food menu to cater to the palates of the great and the good.<br/>\r\n-Customise your space to keep it at the cutting edge of design.<br/>\r\n-Fill your caf\u00e9 with the latest greatest entertainments and distractions.<br/>\r\n-Keep up to date on the latest trends on social media, because as soon as something goes mainstream, the hipsters are looking for the new cool thing.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeveloped in the Loading Bar in the hipster centre of Dalston, London by a bunch of hairy people who work as 'freelancers in media', Hipster Caf\u00e9 is a simulation game based on very real life experiences.
