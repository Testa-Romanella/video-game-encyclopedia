{"id": 572970, "slug": "good-grief", "name": "Good Grief", "name_original": "Good Grief", "description": "<p>Student project based on old arcade maze games. Help Grief the ghost navigate the neon maze of afterlife, while avoiding the dangers of limbo. \u00a0To finish a round Grief must collect all the level keys(Blue Triangles) while also collecting necro points(pink orbs) that fill the necro bar and give score points. The higher the score, the higher are your chances of getting to the next level.<br/></p>\n<p>Instructions: <br/></p>\n<p>Arrows or WASD = move the character</p>\n<p>Space\u00a0=\u00a0When\u00a0the\u00a0necro\u00a0bar(pink bar on top left corner of the screen)\u00a0glows\u00a0the\u00a0player\u00a0can\u00a0press\u00a0space\u00a0to\u00a0Phase.\u00a0 Besides giving temporary\u00a0speed,\u00a0 Phasing also allows\u00a0Grief\u00a0to\u00a0pass\u00a0through\u00a0walls,\u00a0usefull for avoid\u00a0enemy\u00a0traps.</p>\n<p>Combos = If Grief manage to collect necropoints and keys without pausing between them, she will build a combo. The longer she mantains her combo, the higher the combo counter goes, making every object she collects worth more points.</p>\n<p>Enemies</p>\n<p>Slug(Big eye): Slugs can end the round if they manage to come in direct contact with Grief, but as their names suggest, they are not very fast. Their slime trail(Green tiles) however, can slow down player's movement speed, momentiraly.</p>\n<p>Chaser(Big Mouth): Careful, they bite. While their mouths are closed, Chaser movement is\u00a0manageble problem.\u00a0 But if they find themselves in a unubstructed straight line in relation to Grief, \u00a0their mouths will open and their speed will be unmatchable. This is as deadly as the afterlife can get.</p>\n<p>Master(Floating Brain): The master will never directly chase or cause harm. But once inside it's\u00a0field, the necro bar will stop glowing, indicating that Grief is unable to Phase. Beware.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:23:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f97/f97e8ca273d705ff01d6baa28bb606c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheoFS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
