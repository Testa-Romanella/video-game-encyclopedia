The plant\u00a0needs its soil in healthy condition until it can grow. Too much sun light will dry up the soil and kill the plant. Too much water will make the soil damp and eventually kill the plant. Your goal is to place the plant in the\u00a0weather where the soil needs it, and keep the health of the soil in balance between wetness and dryness within two minutes.</p>\n<p>Watchout for tornadoes! It can drag you to the corner. While being dragged by tornado, you cannot pick up or drop the plant.<br/>Watchout for thunders! It can stun you for a short duration. When you are struck by thunder, you also drop the plant.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- <strong>Move</strong> with <strong>LEFT</strong>\u00a0&amp;\u00a0<strong>RIGHT</strong> arrow keys.<br/>- <strong>Jump</strong> with <strong>UP</strong> arrow key.<br/>- <strong>Pick up</strong> or <strong>drop</strong> with <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>100 CC0 SFX #2<br/>by rubberduck<br/>license: CC0</li><li>Free Retro SFX<br/>by inertsongs</li><li>UI 8Bit - Retro SOUNDPACK<br/>by HoneyPhonic</li><li>Sound effects Mini Pack1.5<br/>by Swiss Arcade Game Entertainment</li><li>Spell Sounds Starter Pack<br/>by p0ss<br/>license: CC-BY-SA 3.0</li><li>Wind Loop<br/>by Jonathan Shaw (InspectorJ)<br/>license: CC-BY 3.0</li><li>Bury The Light (8-bit cover)<br/>by ilmutus<br/><em>(\"Bury The Light\" is music written by Casey Edwards)</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T10:31:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5a/c5a9c8540814132cdd7809849d84934f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Agent Amian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
