I really wanted to have a mechanic where you could switch between Anne and Sprig, and they'd each control differently. Sprig could double jump and move faster, but only Anne could attack, or something like that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T03:31:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09f/09f10225c4fcfed22c60f9f4d1924abf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tsuwami"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
