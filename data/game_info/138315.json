The game requires two human players and is played for three consecutive rounds on different environments. Players have access to cannons, torpedoes, and lob shots as they try to bombard their opponent while surviving the onslaught of waves that affect movement and aim. The various stages in the game have different mechanics, such as projectiles being unable to pass through waves on the sea level, storms and hurricanes upset the motion of the waves on the sky level, and having the waves in the space level be difficult to see without using torpedoes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14c/14c7333b55d174fa948b028f70e303bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christopher Peterson"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
