Your goal is to somehow get the owner to come back to you.</p>\n<p>Originally the protagonist was meant to be humanoid. They were meant to\u00a0travel through 5 unique areas and explore the region. I had planned a story and everything, but while creating this game I also worked on a semester project. Since we were behind we had to work in the weekend, I had\u00a0less time to finalize this game, which I now consider a prototype, or proof of concept.</p>\n<p>This approximately amounts to 1/5 of what I originally wanted to make. But maybe someday I will finish what I\u00a0originally set out to do.</p>\n<p>(Rate the Game Here)\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/yogscast-game-jam/rate/535605</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS / GOAL:<br/></p><p>You must gather resources and deliver them to the fireplace.</p>\n<p>BUGS:</p>\n<p>It may be impossible to finish the game if you pick up both resources and deliver them. The only workaround is to only collect one resource at a time and deliver it. Since it's a Game Jam I cannot upload my fixed version.
