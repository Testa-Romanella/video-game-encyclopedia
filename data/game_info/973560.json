Laid off from yet another job, your rent was long past due and your prospects looked dismal. So when you got an unexpected call from a company you\u2019d never heard of, you jumped at the chance. Your interviewer wasn\u2019t some old man in a suit, though: she was a purple-skinned demoness who promised you a life you could scarcely dream of, if you signed on the dotted line. How could you refuse?<br/><br/>Now, given a new sexy demonic form (of any gender you'd like) you\u2019re in command of Paradise, a massive luxury mall and hotel that appeared all but overnight. You must build new shops, maintain your energy levels, and find those whose inner desires run deep enough that they would be willing to trade their soul for a new life. With a devoted secretary, a new body, and a wealth of possibilities, it\u2019s time to report for your first day of work!<br/><br/>Paradise Inc is a swinging, bisexual adventure into a world of magic and mystery. Find humans with powerful desires, grant them a form that fulfills them, and set them loose on your customers\u2026and each other!  Just be careful. It turns out there's a lot more to being a succubus/incubus than just enjoying the perks of the job, including break-ins, kidnappings, magic-gone-wrong... and a hidden agenda that your new boss just happened to fail to mention.
