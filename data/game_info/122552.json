Resonance is a new type of horror game which focuses on suspense rather than jump-scares and advanced enemy AI to make it a thrilling experience requiring skill and dedication to complete. A keen memory will serve you well as you attempt to unravel the mystery of the backstory in order to complete the game.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Echolocation -\u00a0</strong>In Resonance you are able to see by making noise. This can be through movement, clapping, interacting with the environment and other methods. However, when you make noise you risk being discovered by things you would\u00a0rather avoid. This adds an interesting element of strategy to navigating the environment which is enhanced by thoughtful and\u00a0<strong>innovative level design\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>multiple enemy types</strong>\u00a0each with different ways to detect you.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Every death is a serious loss</strong>. Like old-school games if you die too often and lose all \u201clives\u201d then it is game over. This is a very important feature for a horror game which is often overlooked. The primary flaw of otherwise excellent\u00a0games like\u00a0<strong>Resident Evil 7</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Outlast</strong>\u00a0is that after a few\u00a0deaths you will begin to feel immune to the element of fear. Each death reminds you that there is no real danger or reason for suspense as there is nothing at stake. This is not the case in\u00a0<strong>Resonance</strong>\u00a0- die too many times and you will lose your progress. (in a future update this feature can be disabled if it is not to your liking - however for the purpose of community feedback it will remain enabled for a few update cycles in order to gauge a fair amount of lives).</li><li>Resonance consists of 100% original and high quality models, textures and animations (with the exception of a sky box in one of the later levels).</li><li><strong>Updates Incoming! -\u00a0\u00a0</strong>Expect further development in the following areas:<ul><li>Sound effects</li><li>level design</li><li>bug fixes - the game has been tested rigorously in-house however nothing will match community feedback.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/139437e7277d66dd692be76ae2e05b2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ResonantGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
