One player takes the role of the human, who has been possessed by a demon and must survive until the demon leaves his body. The other player is the demon who has to kill the human while he is possessing him. <br/>There are many objects throughout the map that the human has to dispose to stay safe while trying to not expose himself to danger, and the demon can take advantage of the environment and use objects to take the human's life.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>FAQ<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>What's up with the weird name?<br/></strong><ul><li>After a year in development we still haven't found a name that fits the game, so we chose 2310D3B0 as a temporal name. Any name suggestions are appreciated (and if we chose a name suggested by someone we will add them to the spacial thanks in the\u00a0credits of the game).</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Does the game have online multiplayer?</strong><ul><li>No, it's local multiplayer only, but there are services like Parsec that let you play local multiplayer games online and we have tested them and have found that they work really well.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Are you going to update the game in the future?<br/></strong><ul><li>Yes, but it may take some time.
