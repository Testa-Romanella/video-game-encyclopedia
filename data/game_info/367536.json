Theme: Floating Sky Islands<br/>Control a glider and soar between procedural generated sky islands. *Apologies for the frame rate!*<br/></p>\n<p>Use W / S to pitch down / up. Use A / D to roll left / right.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The Good: Procedural generation creates interesting islands. I was able to create islands with a \"bowl\" to have a central land mass surrounded by water. I used a Gaussian filter to smooth out the islands where needed to create more realistic slopes. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The Bad: Glider physics is shonky. It's an okay estimation, and I spent a long time working on it so wanted to include it. Getting the physics and the user controls to play nicely was the biggest challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The Ugly: To avoid getting bogged down in mesh manipulation, each cube is an individual GameObject, which tanks the frame rate.</p>\n\n<p>The Future: I'd like to do more with Procedural Generation. I have some ideas for a 4X game using Procedural Generation, so will work on this next.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T06:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b2cfebfd759af55c91fd7b81b24d69d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["elliot-winch"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
