Flea lingers in the darkness, ready to pounce.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTake control of Squeek, a trained ninja, as he attempts to escape this living nightmare. Slice and chomp your way through crowds as you attempt to escape the clutches of the demonic cat that hunts you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMany enemies block your path, you can choose to cut them down with your sword, or eat them to restore health. Be wary though, some foes may don armour, too tough for you to chomp through. Might be a good idea to slow Flea down by throwing some of the vertically challenged enemies its way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T03:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39bb7801e1d98ab10e55a2826d51641c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Cyborg Kitten Studios", "Stefan Yeung"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stefan Yeung"], "esrb_rating": null}
