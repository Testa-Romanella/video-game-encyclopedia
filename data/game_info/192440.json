Students had to make a two-player 'sports game'. I did it as well.</p>\n<p>This is a super rough idea for real-time lawn bowls, using the controls from One Button Real Time Twenty-Six Play Party Golfing. Hold the button to start charing and aiming, release to fire. Fire all your balls before the timer runs out. Game stops once all balls have stopped moving. Winner of the round is whoever gets the closest ball, an they get one point for ever ball that is the closest to the kitty before being interrupted by the other player. So if you have the first and second closest ball and the other player has the third closest, you get two points. First to ten points wins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Player 1:\u00a01, Q, A, Z.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Player 2:\u00a00, O, K, M</p>\n<p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #28 of 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a86/a86692ef8e46f4dcf5008c5999d2da38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
