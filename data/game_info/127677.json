The goal is to escape the cave you have found yourself in.  Move with WASD and mouse, click to interact.  </p><p> The development team was myself, and my two oldest children (we entered the game jam as a team).  I was responsible for programming, Rachel for level design, and Hannah for story.</p><p> <em>All donations for my games go directly to support the Technology Cooperative, a 501c3 nonprofit organization founded to create a technology-focused community that provides computer-related technology access and awareness.</em> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbb/dbb80ab14373e4832c3212497918450f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Michael C.
