Of course you have one of these ancient manipulators around, you weirdo! Hmm, the only program here is \"penguins.exe\".\u00a0 I'd rather not touch it, but who am I\u00a0to stop you?</em></p>\n<p>Use mouse to start programs (only one works), select files and\u00a0throw files and penguins\u00a0into recycling bin (doesn't work with folders though).
