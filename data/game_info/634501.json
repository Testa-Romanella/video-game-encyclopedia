{"id": 634501, "slug": "john-mccracken-freedom-specialist", "name": "John McCracken - Freedom Specialist", "name_original": "John McCracken - Freedom Specialist", "description": "<p>Base Game Idea:\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Somewhere in the old west, a group of bank robbers have been living  the life. But like most of the outlaws, they get caught by the sheriff  and his men. After a fast trial they are now  waiting to get hanged in local prison. John  McCracken is a man that the outlaws then makes contact with. He is a specialist for  criminals to free them from prisons. He has freed a lot of prisoners  over the course of his life and knows a lot of ways to free the  prisoners.\r\n </p>\n<p>Prototype goal:\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Player enters a small town. The prisoners are in the jail in the  sheriffs office. there are 2 prisoners to be freed. Player can start  shooting the npc's but that means that the prisoners are separated to 2  different locations , making the game a bit harder. Also hostile NPC's  will have an alerted state so that they will shoot on site. This means  that it is wiser for player to use some tactics before trying to free  the prisoners. This game will contain small puzzles to make it easier to  free them. <br/></p>\n<p>In this version of the protype, the separation of the prisoners are not implemented. This is a very short prototype, but I think the feel of the game is there. (and bugs ofc)</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Controls: mouse + aswd, game paused from \"Q\" (didn't remeber to change it before posting) and the pause menu is still weirdly buggy but will find out at some point why the hell it doesn't let continue to happen. If quit is pressed the music starts again on another musicplayer and starts to sound funny. but this is just something I forgot to correct on this<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T07:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae9/ae9c38d7a87b72ca6613885b0445d968.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StoneMoose"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
