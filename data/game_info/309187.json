Travel across a plethora of rich worlds, unlock awesome weaponry and learn to trap even the trickiest species in The Podlands.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Explore</strong> primeval wildlands and soothing nature.<br/></li><li> <strong>Discover</strong> all sorts of incredible Dinpod species.<br/></li><li> <strong>Unlock</strong> a wide array of wicked weapons and crafty traps.<br/></li><li> <strong>Become</strong> the ultimate prehistoric trapper.</li></ul><br/><br/><strong>Expeditions are your way of finding animals.</strong> Each expedition will require its fair share of preparation, as you come up with the best strategies to catch your targets. <strong>Experiment </strong>with the various kinds of <strong>equipment </strong>, and pick the best for the job. Each animal will require a different strategy - your <strong>netgun </strong>might be great for catching small, slow animals, but they're unreliable weapons with slow projectiles, and a large animal won't even be slowed by the impact. Instead, you might want to <strong>trap </strong>them, and use the slowdown to <strong>tranquilize </strong>them up close. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Exploration and discovery drive The Podlands' experience.</strong> Each world is a completely unique space. Each world has its own <strong>unique species</strong>, and rarer, more <strong>valuable variants</strong> of more common species may be found in certain worlds. Gallipods, for instance, live, well... Everywhere. Generally they're not that interesting, but particular worlds, such as the <strong>tropical </strong>one, will often carry rare versions of the animal. Meanwhile, the <strong>steppe </strong>world contains various special species, which aren't found elsewhere. Each world has its unique challenges, risks and rewards. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Each dinosaur in The Podlands holds a certain value;</strong> the <strong>larger</strong> the animal, and the <strong>rarer</strong> its <strong>genetic variations</strong>, the more it'll be worth. You'll always want to be hunting large and special specimens first. Each of these dinosaurs can then be sold to bring in some extra Podpounds, which you can in turn spend on <strong>better equipment</strong>, or <strong>access to new worlds</strong>. To maximize your profits, you can take <strong>contracts </strong>on specific animals. Bring them back succesfully, and you'll be able to significantly increase your earnings, seriously speeding up your growth.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a3/9a3b4dc4fd09c01b44e0f0a18cb83655.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 344, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Podlands"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Podlands"], "esrb_rating": null}
