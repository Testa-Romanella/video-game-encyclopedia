{"id": 812614, "slug": "gays-phere", "name": "GayS phere", "name_original": "GayS phere", "description": "<p><strong>\"GayS phere\" is a 3D game where your mission is to find other characters to bring colour into your world.</strong></p>\n<p>You arrive at a Christian Summer Camp your parents have sent you on. The Camp is horrible and you're lonely and scared. Even the very colours around you seem to have bled away and the entire world is in gray-scale. However, sitting still and feeling sorry for yourself is not any way to make things better, so you get up and decide to mingle. Perhaps you might even find other like minded people here to make your world brighter once more?</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWelcome to Christian Summer Camp!</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>We here at Camp \u201cUnbend and Straighten Up\u201d wish to help you on your journey as a person. Join us in the beautiful nature and enjoy a summer full of learning to walk on the straight and narrow, become an upstanding citizen and create fond memories that you will look back on for years to come.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The game is a 3D simulation game where your job as a player is to go around the Camp and interact with the different characters, get to know them, and as you find the other teenagers who belong in the LGBTQ+ community, and realise you're not as alone as you first thought, your world gets more and more colourful.</p>\n\n<p>Excluding the player-character, there are 6 other teenagers at the camp, all with their own interests and personalities.</p>\n<p><strong>Kurt:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Kurt is a friendly young man who likes going to the gym, dancing, and watching Disney movies. He is, however, not all that happy to divulge the reasons he was sent to this camp.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Lilith:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Lilith is an opinionated young lady and is unafraid to voice those opinions out loud. Her hobbies include, knitting, DnD and taking care of plants, and she rather enjoys being controversial and a \"disappointment\" to her parents.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Cheerio:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Cheerio is, as their name suggests, a cheerful and excited teen who has decided to live their life as honest to themselves as possible, no matter what others may say about the matter. They're a fan of playing video games, baking, and rock climbing.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Derek:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Derek is a dude and a bro of the friendliest kind. He's outspoken about his interests, such as american football, Fast and Furious movies and cooking, and views the whole experience as a chill break.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Becky:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Becky is famous (at least according to herself) and is the only one of the teenagers at the camp who managed to sneak a phone in. Why? because she has two, duh. You can find her on Instagram, where she talks about fashion and showcases her watercolour paintings.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Jessie:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Jessie is what some might call an \"edgelord\", and leans into the moniker with all his heart, enjoying Tarantino movies, poetry by Edgar Allan Poe and controversial comedians such as Kevin Hart.\u00a0But of course he only accepts the moniker if you say it respectfully, as otherwise you're what\u00a0<em>he</em>\u00a0calls a \"pleb\".\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move around with <strong>W-A-S-D</strong> or the <strong>arrow keys</strong>.</li><li>Move the camera around with your <strong>mouse</strong>.</li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong> to continue after reading.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>If time and resources allowed:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>With more time and resources the game would ideally have <strong>a)</strong> more characters, <strong>b)</strong> a bigger area to explore, and <strong>c)</strong> more possible interactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What this means, is that we would have <strong>more teenagers</strong> roaming the Camp, all with their own backstories and personalities that the player could talk to and interact with, as well as a <strong>proper model for the player character</strong>. Accordingly, <strong>the game area would also be bigger</strong>, have more in it, and even possible <strong>interactive features, such as the escape route, a cabin, waterfall, etc.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Game &amp; Narrative Designer / Writer</strong> \u2014 Jintastic\r\n</li><li><strong>3D Artist</strong> \u2014 Tarina\r\n</li><li><strong>3D Artist</strong> \u2014 Tharlvend / Taru V\r\n</li><li><strong>3D Artist</strong> \u2014 Petra\r\n</li><li><strong>3D Artist / Programmer</strong> \u2014 Sofia / MuffinHop\r\n</li><li><strong>Programmer</strong> \u2014 Felryen\u00a0</li><li><strong>Music/Sound Composer</strong> \u2014 Cecil Opia</li></ul>\n<p><em>The game was made during \"Pride Game Jam HKI\" on the weekend of 30.6.-3.7.2022.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T12:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703a7ab8bfd63057d6f01447d435ea24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cecil Opia", "Jintastic", "tarina", "MuffinHop", "Tharlvend"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
