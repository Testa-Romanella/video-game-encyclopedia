We're a husband-wife dev team, and had to wrangle kids alongside game jam this weekend, but it all worked out.\u00a0Physics-based driving mechanics, aggressive AI, fun arcade mechanics, and a clean low-poly look make this one of my favorite jam games so far.\u00a0</p><p>The comic on the sidebar was a quick storyboard for an opening sequence we cut early on. We wanted a comic book feel and a kooky reason for the car to turn left, and the idea of a serial bank robber with his dog driving the\u00a0getaway car seemed like a great fit. We wanted to have Louie the dog's head sticking out of the driver's window, but that, too, got cut to save schedule.\u00a0On the plus side, the driving experience and dodging the AI cops came together nicely, and we managed to sneak some of the flavor from the intro sequence into a couple places in-game.</p><p>All-in-all, a great experience. We encourage you to check out the game, and give us your thoughts (great or irate) - feedback makes us better at making games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:10:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d7/3d7670f634de63ae66ee9eeb646a2ca1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Two Bit Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
