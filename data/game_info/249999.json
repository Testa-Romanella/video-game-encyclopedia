The game is rich with lore, but low on exposition. Its controls are simple but nuanced, letting players become the Outlier, an alien creature hauled from another dimension and discarded into a dangerous wasteland.<br/><br/>Survive a strange and dangerous environmentAs the Outlier, leap and cling from surface to surface. Harness alien ectoplasm to fly through the air. Collect nutrient to sprout alien seeds and solve puzzles. Explore cavernous environments in a fallen world of corporate cults, mad science and lost souls, where alien creatures slither through the ruins of a failed utopia, and the engineered slaves of the past toil ceaselessly to siphon ectoplasm from other dimensions. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Use careful observation and dexterity to avoid the tentacles, spines and homing projectiles of dangerous alien creatures. Spread ectoplasm, turning the world from hostile to habitable -- by your alien standards.<br/><br/>Discover your Purpose<br/>Throughout the game a pair of strange humanoids follow you, watching, bickering and advising. These are Demi and Tillinghast.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Demi and Tillinghast have unique stories and agendas tied both to this world\u2019s history and its future. Ponder their philosophical outlooks as you play, uncovering lost souls trapped in the ruins, and deciding whether to free them or drown them -- or ignore all of that and focus on honing your skills to get through these levels as fast as possible! The game endorses both deliberate and frenetic play-styles, and the narrative will accommodate you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/cecc3215fd942d341bd455aa7dc38b3b.jpg", "website": "https://ectolibrium.wordpress.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nate Spence"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nate Spence"], "esrb_rating": null}
