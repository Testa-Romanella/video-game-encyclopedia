Worms love eating fruit, even though it makes them poop. But this is a good thing: poop becomes flowers and flowers bring much joy to the world.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEat fruit, avoid poop, flowers increase the score multiplier, eating flowers makes the multiplier smaller. Use arrow keys to steer, use Z or X to jump over hazards.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Game by kometbomb and iLkKe.</em>\n</p>\n\r\nTips for newbie worms\r\n<ul>\n<li>Remember to jump! Jump over flowers, poop and your own tail - not just lava. You can turn even while in the air.</li>\n<li>You will get a higher score if you avoid eating flowers. The more flowers there are on screen the more points you will get for eating fruit and when you finish the level.</li>\n<li>The faster you finish a level the larger time bonus you will get. You might want to sacrifice a few flowers in order to worm faster.</li>\n<li>Sometimes a letter will fall from the sky.
