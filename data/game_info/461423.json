You, as the manager of this chaotic island, need to guide the local residents to constantly avoid disasters such as fires, snowstorms, and possibly sea level rise.</p>\n<p>Controls are pretty much fully mouse based. Left click to execute actions, Right click, hold, and drag to look around the map, and Scroll to zoom in-n-out. ESC key to pause</p>\n<p>Once the population reaches 0, the temperature drops below -15\u00b0c, or goes above 45\u00b0c, you will lose your job... So beware!\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Houses generate coins, increase the population, and also increase temperature moderately.</li><li>Fires increase the temperature drastically, but they can't spread through dirt.</li><li>Snow decreases the temperature drastically, and it spreads like fire but slower.</li><li>Trees can help decrease the temperature moderately.</li><li>Grass can also help decrease the temperature but slimly.</li><li>Dirt is neutral, but it will turn into grass automatically in a certain amount of time.</li></ul>\n<p>How long will you survive in this catastrophic disastrous\u00a0Island?
