He was beloved by the villagers, and cherished by the nobility.</p>\n<p>But... he had a little problem with gambling, and cheating. You see, all his magic was achieved through mischiefs. He couldn't stop himself, robbing everyone who stood in his way.</p>\n<p>One day the good people of the kingdom had enough. They stormed his tower and demanded their money back! The king sent his guard to seal the deal. Only a good cast of dice could save the mage at this point!</p>\n<p>==========================</p>\n\n<p>\u26a0\ufe0f\u00a0We were late on the submission , VFXs are missing for these spells, please don't be mean to us!
