You really want to hug everyone you see. The problem is that you are a monster and people tend to run away from you. You need to sneak up on them to be able to hug them. Unfortunately you always hug to hard and crush them. You get really sad for a moment, until you spot another human to hug. </p><p>How to beat the game: Hug all humans to death! <br/><br/>--- Important --- <br/>Once you grab a human, keep the hug button pressed to crush them. <br/><br/>We had a great time making Hugs and it will be very interesting to hear what you guys think of it. <br/><br/>Special thanks to our friend Markus Kothe for creating the music and ambient sounds &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/955/955ccc4bc048f6c6a957ea7d3d67b851.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["vidarn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
