Read why at the bottom of the page, or ignore this message if you don't want spoilers<br/></p>\n<p>Zombies (?) are attacking you, go kill them with your gun that never needs you to reload! No sound effects, no music, no enemy artwork, but somehow full animation for the player. This truly is Bad Game 3.0.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spiritual successor to GUNRAT. There are no \"Bad Game 1.0\" or \"Bad Game 2.0\", I am counting those as being GUNRAT and\u00a0Pop-Up Ad Closing Simulator, neither of which are fun and you should not play.</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<ul><li>WASD / D-Pad / Left-Joystick - Movement in the menu/game\r\n</li><li>SPACE / A Button - Shoot the gun in game / selection in the menu</li><li>ESCAPE - Exit the game\r\n</li></ul>\r\nKNOWN BUGS:\r\n<ul><li>The bullet doesn't line up with the gun when firing\r\n</li><li>The game isn't fun<ul><li>This unfixable\r\n</li><li>Can be slightly mitigated by using a Joypad controller. Doesn't make the game more fun but does allow you to shoot more accurately.</li><li>Go play any of my other games instead, such as Cardolon [DELUXE] or Imperial Flight Deluxe\r\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\r\nASSETS USED:\r\n<ul><li>Kenney Font Package - Kenney\r\n</li><li>Top Down Runner - tokka</li><li>Gun and Bullet - donnie9171\r\n</li><li>Heart 16*16 -\u00a0NicoleMarieProductions</li></ul>\r\nWHY DOES IT ACCESS THE CAMERA:\r\n<p>On the victory screen (when you kill all the enemies) the game takes a picture and uses that as the background. That's it. I originally intended for you to take a picture of something and have it as an enemy but it didn't work for some reason.
