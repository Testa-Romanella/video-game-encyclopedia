You can also compete through the global online leaderboard.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Frienemies is a 2D online shooter for 2 players. You face off together against waves of zombies but compete with each other for points. The winner (i.e. The player to not die) steals the points of the other player. Players can mess with each other by shoving crates to stun their \"companion\". In order to achieve a high score, work together initially to gain points and then turn on each other like DOGS! Remember, only the survivor keeps the spoils.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>* WASD movement.<br/>* Left click: Shoot.<br/>* Right click: Shove a crate that's in front of you.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Zombie: https://opengameart.org/content/animated-top-down-zombie<br/>Soldier: https://opengameart.org/content/animated-top-down-survivor-player<br/>Terrain: https://opengameart.org/content/grass-tileset-16x16</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4f/f4fb5a13a84dbb7db06c488e641f6246.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Karnage Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
