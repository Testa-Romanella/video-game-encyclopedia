The player runs on the left side of the screen and has to jump through various designed obstacle courses. There are ten levels and you can't pause the game once you start. The goal is to beat all ten levels with zero deaths.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'll be honest, this game is hard. I mean, this game is really hard. You're gonna give up on level 2.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By your 250th death you'll be scouring the internet for cheat codes. And you won't find any.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/914e2f5dc1a6219af74c80e3c5467238.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["qzar24"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
