Avoiding rotations that engage the Vestibular System removes the mismatch with the Visual system that can trigger discomfort in VR.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sharp movements, such as <strong> translational dodges </strong> , are <strong> kept comfortable </strong> by requiring fast hand-motion, producing an Efference Copy that the brain can use to explain the visual transition. Gameplay progresses down a tight path to <strong> maximize optic flow </strong> and generate the <strong> percept of high speeds </strong>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dopamine, everyone's favorite neuromodulator, leads to an enjoyable experience in both its baseline and spikes. Tonic Dopamine is sustained at a high baseline through <strong> frequent intermediate rewards </strong> such as the <strong> Asteroid Destruction System </strong>. Spikes in Phasic Dopamine are achieved with gameplay highlights such as <strong> destroying The Guardian </strong> . <br/><br/><br/><br/>The <strong> interactive mechanical interface </strong> the player physically moves to steer provides intrinsically rewarding <strong> agency </strong> and <strong> the pace of the gameplay is in the hands of the player </strong> , with a <strong> Boost system </strong> that allows for safe and slow cruising through the <strong> Asteroid Mining Facility </strong> or a break-neck <strong> race to the Portal </strong>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The player always has an Internal Locus of Control. Unlike other VR titles, there is <strong> no Game-Over from looking the wrong way </strong> . HUD information <strong> communicated through color </strong> for quick processing that minimizes Cognitive Load and allows players to focus on the gameplay itself. <br/><br/><br/><br/>At high difficulties all the skills and strategy come together in a <strong> tight simple competitive loop </strong> that is infinitely replayable. <strong> Compete against your friends or on the Online Leaderboards </strong> in an engaging sci-fi runner with <strong> deep Arcade-like systems </strong> to learn, enjoy and master.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T03:18:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/838dcf8563c2257b4576b480a9e92004.jpg", "website": "https://vrgestudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 441, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VRGE Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["VRGE Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
