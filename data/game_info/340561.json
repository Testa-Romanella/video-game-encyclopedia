He quickly realizes he might have been over his head with this client's request. A missing woman with 4 different identities, aside from her own, goes missing; the police don't want to find her, and the unshakable feeling of being watched only grows stronger. Something isn't right. In the Disappearance of Miyuki Ida (Demo), you'll play as Miyuki Ida and this demo will act as a segway to the full version of the game later on. When you play, you'll realize how she disappeared, but not why. When the full game is developed, you'll play as private investigator Takeo Nishihara, to find out what truly happened to her and what lead to her actions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:36:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74b/74bc71a5ec01d9ffcaabb4ecae1a9d7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Evelyn Cao"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
