I didn't realize until my teens that when someone said something like \"imagine you are on a beach... see the sand, waves, etc\" that a lot of people actually see that in their head. This game is a rough attempt to show visually how a person that can't \"picture the scene in their head\" recalls memories. At times it can feel like sifting through a world of words to put the right ones together. Sometimes it's an easy path to follow. While still others require a bit of a fight for the last little details.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T03:44:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdbcf9c77f8fe94126e5a9a7c46cff40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Vimlark"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
