The only enemy here is the frozen water that is oddly rising up and down. Maneuver the platforms, dodge deadly waters &amp; find a way to repair your spaceship so you can get back home.</p>\n\n<p>Looks like this place wasn't always a wasteland...</p>\n\n\n<p>-- THIS GAME IS IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT &amp; RUN BY ONE PERSON WITH A JOB AND OTHER PROJECTS GOING ON so please be patient ;-; life is very time consuming. With that in mind, here's some things that will (hopefully) be added to this game:</p>\n<p>- More levels! The reason this is called Deadly tide and not Frozen tide is because there will be different types of water in this game, each with their own unique abilities that makes traversing them difficult. and of course, different environments as well.</p>\n<p>- Cutscenes! Or text to explain what is going on after each level. either way, there is a story developing here and it would be nice if you knew what it was.</p>\n<p>- Better graphics! It would be nice if the game didn't look like an 8 year old made it. This will require outside help, so I will worry about this one at a later date</p>\n<p>- Level Select Menu! so you can play any level you have unlocked! also would be very helpful to find secret levels... you didn't hear it from me</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I would just like to thank the few (if any) people who check this game out. I don't know if this will go anywhere, but I hope you enjoy what little is here anyway</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T01:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/7116a0505964a91e3da5609f6d963630.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Scwambled"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
