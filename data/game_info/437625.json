Bullet hell experts could probably clear this in like five minutes.<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys control movement. There's no basic attack button; that's automatic. Pressing Z or X will cast one of two spells respectively, once your Mana bar is full.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Title Text was created using: https://cooltext.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Background was taken from Spriters' Resource: https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/biblefight/sheet/73685/</p>\n<p>BGM: https://degitx.bandcamp.com/track/catch-my-dragon</p>\n<p>All other assets were created by myself.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T04:26:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23b/23b861def4ebbfb4530d8647b3288af0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YoungMrKusuma"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
