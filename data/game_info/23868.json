This one- or \n      two-player game features a floating golf course in the sky. High above \n      Dream Land, players can pitch and putt the ever-popular puffball, Kirby, \n      through a maze of obstacles on a zany checkerboard course. Players must \n      aim for the multitude of enemies that are spread throughout each \n      fairway. Kirby's Copy Abilities return in this installment, and these \n      must be put to good use in order to complete a level objective. Hit all \n      of the enemies to make them disappear, and the last one becomes the \n      hole. Sink Kirby into the hole to advance to the next stage as you clear \n      all eight courses\u201464 holes in all.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
