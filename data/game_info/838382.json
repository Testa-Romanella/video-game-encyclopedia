THE CURSOR WILL APPEAR. MOVE IT\u00a0towards the point you want the droid to go to. Then RELEASE.\u00a0Example: hover over door, release it,\u00a0then the droid will open the door.</p>\n<p>Point at the droid to cancel the choice of command. The available command count can be seen inside a blue circle above the droid. When given no commands, the droid will use its own AI!</p>\n<p>Press right mouse button\u00a0to enable the weapon!</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Known problems:</p>\n<p>- When chased by creatures, the droid may end up going into the wall and get \"eaten\". Nothing you can do about it :( Just be fast enough to protect the droid! :)</p>\n<p>- Sometimes the doors (especially the one after the control room)\u00a0won't open, and the droid goes somewhere else... Restart and try again?</p>\n<p>- Texts disappear too quickly. It's ok if you read them one by one. Just don't rush.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0It's not \"click\" the mouse button, but \"press\" it</p>\n\n<p>Sounds used:</p>\n<p>KaozOfficial -\u00a0https://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/112683/dub-wave-by-kaozofficial-free-140b...<br/></p>\n<p>Topschool -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Topschool/sounds/361072/<br/>Patrick_Corra -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Patrick_Corra/sounds/540050/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:55:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/639/639fc82a16289666cf160cfa7a9f417d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tatarinovst"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
