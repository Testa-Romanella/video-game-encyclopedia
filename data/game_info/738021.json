I hope you enjoy it! :-) There&#39;s some references to eight-bit classics that helped inspire Snailiad, and you might also find a cameo or two from RPG Shooter: Starwish, if you play long enough.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to:</p>\n<p>AdamAtomic, for Flixel!<br />\nxdanond, for drawing some stuff!<br />\nnewstarshipsmell, for lots of testing!<br />\njsr, for Famitracker!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T19:06:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dd/5dd94887a95dfd06e6f900bebdc39bef.jpg", "website": "https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/573352", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
