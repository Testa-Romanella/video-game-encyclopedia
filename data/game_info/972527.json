In this game, you play as a young girl named Urotsuki and explore your dreams, much like Yume Nikki. The goal of the game is to collect the Effects scattered throughout the dream worlds, which is also similar to its predecessor. However, Yume 2kki is far larger than its prequel and is still growing, as it is currently under development (it&#39;s fully functional despite this fact).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-22T03:03:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/355/355dfbcd4eeb5de78c166cb26437143f.jpg", "website": "https://wikiwiki.jp/yumenikki-g3/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
