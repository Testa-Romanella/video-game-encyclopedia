The player must learn how to properly progress in their farm, as each soil has different properties and watering needs, and monsters can only be defeated with a sword made of a harder mineral than they are. My partners and I worked directly with a second grade class to create this game. The learning topics of the game were provided by the teacher, and the students supplied the idea and name of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:47:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/307a40877289384bcda61ce7a94e91f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kelsey Wimberley"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
