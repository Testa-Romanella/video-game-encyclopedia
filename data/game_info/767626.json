{"id": 767626, "slug": "wyoming-winter", "name": "Wyoming Winter", "name_original": "Wyoming Winter", "description": "In Wyoming Winter you and a group of fellow employees find yourselves snowed in to the Wyoming department of defence building as a blizzard covers the state. You'll soon find out your group is not the only thing trapped in the building. Find unique hiding spots, help your fellow employees, complete risky lockdown tasks and find a weapon to fight back.<br/><br/>Hide in. Hold out. Don't be found.<br/><br/><br/>Wyoming Winter is a multiplayer game where one person in the lobby is chosen at random to be the Blight, an almost invincible, fast moving, dark creature that escaped from the lower levels of the Wyoming facility. The rest of the players are employees who's job it is to stop the Blight from escaping the facility. Employees need to either have at least one member alive after 10 minutes or kill the Blight using weapons that can be unlocked from weapon lockers after an employee finishes their list of tasks.<br/><br/>Wyoming Winter is best played with 3-8 players. Servers are available in Europe, America &amp; Asia.<br/><br/><br/>Employee's start with a notepad of tasks and a watch. The notebook contains a list of tasks to be completed before the employee is given a final task to locate a weapon. The watch shows how much time the Blight has left to escape. If the timer ends with at least one employee still alive, the employees will win. The Blight has heightened vision and can see well in dark places along with incredible strength that allows it to snap the neck of any employee in an instant. Both the Blight &amp; employees can climb and crouch into unique and crafty hiding places using the climbing system.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T04:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a1c7a7fcb9b421237a2f626715da0df.jpg", "website": "https://www.valleyhound.games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 2, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wyoming Winter", "ValleyHound Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Casual"], "publishers": ["ValleyHound Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
