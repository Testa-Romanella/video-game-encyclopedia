There are links to these interpreters below. You can also download the stand-alone executable for Windows below. Then you will not need an interpreter.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this game cannot be played online because there are bugs\u00a0 in the ADRIFT WebRunner which made the game behave unacceptably bad. So you will have to play it locally on your device on either Windows, Mac, Linux or Android. I might manage to work around the bugs in the WebRunner and produce an online-version later but don't count on it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T20:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99e/99e7a9e60dc0a1fbcc67d0ea8e72f3d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kenped"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
