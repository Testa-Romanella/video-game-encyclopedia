It's quiet. Only wind can be heard, but you swore that you heard something that didn't quite sound like wind, but you brush it off. The houses are all empty, they look abandoned and yet you feel as though someone is staring at your back. You cross the bridge that's in shambles and once across, you hear footsteps running across the bridge behind you. You turn around to investigate, yet no one is there. You face forward after brushing off the incident as the wind and, as it turns out, this place may not be as abandoned as you thought...</em></p>\n\n<p>Detective Mauri/Mori follows a case after multiple reports of strange occurrences heard from outside a village. Upon arrival at the village on a foggy day, not a single breath was heard or any living creature was seen. What he soon realizes is that all the residents have met their ends and linger restlessly not knowing what their fates were. It\u2019s up to Detective Mauri/Mori to help these poor souls lay to rest and find out what caused their demise. Information about the area can also be discovered throughout the game, given as subtle hints in the world or complete information from pickups or ghost NPCs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f0/9f029de93f4556660147e61dc63a7b24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Archie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
