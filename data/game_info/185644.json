This is the first 2D platformer I created using Unity (a long past version). I think the game and the world of Sycho the squirrel are fun and worth checking out though there might be some technical issues (if you are viewing the game at a small resolution, the UI might not fit in the screen). Unless there is a high demand, I probably won't make updates to this version. That being said, I may revisit the Sycho universe in an upcoming game title. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfa/bfab077e60caf6e7b989cd2af8f0905f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Jarecrow"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
