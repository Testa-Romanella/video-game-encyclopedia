You have to buy your freedom out of that place by maintaining the old man's ranch.\u00a0\r\n<br/>The ranch can be populated with various critters whose produce can be collected for selling to the local marketplace. Every critter gives different resources and sell for a different price. You can buy critters from a shop and there are 6 types of critters.\r\nThe aspect that separates \"The Quick Crit\" from other farming and ranching games is the timer. You have 15 minutes to earn 100k rops (the in-game currency) and failure will lead to eternal slavery.\u00a0\r\n<strong><em>Controls:\u00a0</em></strong>\r\nThe game can be played entirely by a mouse.\r\nThe player moves to the point where they right click.\r\nThe UI can be worked with the mouse and in some places middle button or q can be used.\r\n\n<em>Credits:</em>\r\nAll gameplay and Programming done by CybearTron.\r\nAll the Game Design also done by CybearTron\r\nAll the Art is done by CybearTron.\r\nThe color palette used is https://lospec.com/palette-list/nanner-2022 from Lospec.com\r\nThe Easter Egg images are from the internet and Edge's image creator (Yes there is an easter egg hidden in the game and you can find it by exploring the map!)\r\nThe SFX are made by Cybeartron.\r\nThe absolute lit music for the game is made by Greg Edwards.
