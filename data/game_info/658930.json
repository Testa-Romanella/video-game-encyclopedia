You need to defend your spaceship from the attacking aliens as long as possible. To do this, you can move with <strong>WASD</strong>, and you can chop the aliens when your sword touches them. You also have a secret power. You can activate it with a <strong>left click</strong> on your mouse.<strong> By doing this, you create a clone of yourself, but be careful because your sword can destroy them. Clones can also destroy each other</strong>\u00a0the same way you do.</p>\n<p><strong>credits</strong></p>\n<p>R.Peter - Main programmer, project leader</p>\n<p>Norma - modelling</p>\n<p>nick - programmer</p>\n<p>Mr.Blxck - background music</p>\n<p>fiftysounds.com - SFX</p>\n<p>\"Spaceship\" (https://skfb.ly/6sYD8) by Jefferson Frenay is licensed under CC Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Feel free to leave a review in the comments :)</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T10:24:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0eb/0eb7468323eeea217d8e11ec8e6cdc27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["petifox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
