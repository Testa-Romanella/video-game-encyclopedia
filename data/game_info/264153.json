Now let us catch animals back to the zoo! <br/>Draw a closed square or polygon fence by the stumps to square animals quickly in a grid-based game scene. The smaller the area of a polygon is, the higher the score you can get. In addition, different animals have different properties, so the score you get varies based on the types of animals you \u201ccaught\u201d. Furthermore, there are some game items. You will fail to pass the current level if you cannot reach the goal score within the limited time. After clearing all the game levels, the \u201cendless mode\u201d will be unlocked which you can challenge yourself to get the highest scores you can in endlessly generated levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:02:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d34/d34f5f54f6cc156c384a6f9260917605_F6GMVqx.jpg", "website": "http://shaowenbin.wix.com/home", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["WENBIN SHAO"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["WENBIN SHAO"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
