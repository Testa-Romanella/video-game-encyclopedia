The game sees you take on the role of a protagonist in such a tale, exploring the whimsical nonsense of the realm, and trying to overcome one of its terrifyingly bizarre villains.\r\n</p>\n<p>This micro ttRPG is based on the works of Lewis Carroll, specifically\u00a0Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland (1865)\u00a0and\u00a0Through the Looking-Glass (1871).\u00a0The game embraces Carroll\u2019s love of wordplay by utilising letter tiles from the household word game Scrabble\u00ae\ufe0f (by Mattel) as its conflict-resolution mechanic. In order to overcome obstacles, characters draw tiles from a sack and create words.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>\"Take the two words 'fuming' and 'furious'. Make up your mind that\u00a0you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say\u00a0first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever\u00a0so little towards 'fuming', you will say 'fuming-furious'; if they turn,\u00a0by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious', you will say 'furious-fuming';\u00a0but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced\u00a0mind, you will say 'frumious'.\"\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>- Lewis Carroll</em>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Through the Looking-Glass includes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Rules for surviving the whimsically sinister world as a protagonist\r\n</li><li>A Protagonist Sheet to detail their greatest desire, worst fears, and real-world bonds\r\n</li><li>Two adventure types for the GM to run - the Mystery or the Quest\r\n</li><li>Three Archenemies for the Protagonist to defeat\r\n</li><li>Sixteen illustrated nonsensical NPC Contenders\r\n</li><li>Adventure openings for the GM\u00a0\r\n</li><li>A summary of gameplay for the GM to structure their conflicts and challenges\r\n</li><li>Random Occupation Tables\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>To play\u00a0Through the Looking-Glass\u00a0requires a flat surface, a sheet of paper, a pencil, a sack of tiles with a single letter and number upon them, and a sense of imagination.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T13:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/514/514b2f20c541836a4650f536435766da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JVC Parry"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
