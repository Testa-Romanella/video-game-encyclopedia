The theme was \u201c<strong><em>Joined Together</em></strong>\u201c.\r\n</p>\n<p>Everything is done by myself in Java (Scala actually) based on LibGDX framework. Sorry for big download size - I had to embed java runtime to let you play it without java installed.</p>\n<p>There are multiple endings based on interactions with objects. Right now there are not so much content, but I will be adding it in the future. I liked the concept of this game. Joining game jam was a great idea :D</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<ul><li>Your goal is to save Princess Berta</li><li>Use WSAD to move objects around</li><li>You can join object with your character if they are near each other</li><li>Try to combine objects together to create new objects and solve the puzzles</li><li>Objects reacts to each other only when player is connected to them (items are levitating and there is a blue outline)\u00a0</li><li>It's possible that you stuck in some levels.
