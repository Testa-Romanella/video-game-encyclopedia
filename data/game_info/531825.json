You can move around corners to create L, S or U shapes, however you can't move back on yourself to draw a T-shape for example.</p><p>You have 90 seconds to build as high a score as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>As with my other entry it will only be playable in the browser until the competition deadline passes.

After doing this you will have just over 2,000 bytes free.<br/><br/>I thought a puzzle game was best suited to BASIC, rather than anything that needed to move fast or respond instantly to joystick control.\u00a0I'm not a proficient BASIC programmer by any means, and my\u00a0first attempt to make a more complex block-based game ran out of memory very quickly, so that will be re-programmed in assembly. I ended up with a reasonably playable and responsive game. You can see by the game having no title screen, and 'T, S, and B' being used instead of 'Time', 'Score' and 'Best', I was down to the last few bytes! I also had to remove the delay after the timer ran out, so it just carries straight on into the next<br/></p>\n<p>So you certainly won't be able to achieve as much depth in your game as you would with assembly, but perhaps you can still come up with something better than a lot of the original Cassette 50 games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T07:49:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1b93396be3e425d84de00ec5c72a251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
