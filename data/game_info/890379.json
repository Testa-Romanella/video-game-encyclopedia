It directly targets common misconceptions in first year studies, by allowing students to 'discover' the solution through play. Students can play around with physical parameters using\u00a0simple click and drag mechanics, or they they can calculate the solution to the level on paper, enter it into Physics Gone Wrong, and watch it play out in real-time.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T07:17:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b43/b43c17d1ef7f33714bf6f59e1f351ea4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahmadgalea"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
