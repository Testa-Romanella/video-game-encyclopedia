This is our submission for the 48 hour Kenney Jam!<br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy it.</p>\r\nSummary\r\n<p>The theme was rotating so after some brainstorming we came with the idea of 'rotating' gravity and parts of the level. In our game you can rotate the platforms around the map by pressing 'R' and you can flip the gravity whenever you come across the gravity switch. And if you like an extra challenge then try to collect all of the gems scattered around the levels.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>You can move around by using 'A' and 'D'. You can jump by pressing the 'Spacebar' and last but not least you can drag and push boxes by holding 'Left Shift'.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/934eb24f446f47eb01605f84d44c1dbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Wouter De Moor", "Enzo Mannaert"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
