Illustrated without a protagonist, exploring the themes of eternal life from a different perspective. I let the environment tell the story mostly. In the same way that some of my favorite horror games do. I\u00a0often contemplate possessions that have been left behind, I\u00a0hope it brings that same feeling to you too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T07:53:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79cff08aff304642c120375c043ac806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["baguetti \ud83c\udf5e"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
