Run and jump around a vibrant coastal   town, chatting with eccentric locals, and search for fishing spots that   only a keen eye and a slightly mad mind will be able to discover.</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>In this town, fishing only begins at the ocean: slippery, scaly    creatures may be hiding just about anywhere! By the time you've   finished  exploring main street, you'll be seeing fish in cups of   coffee, street  signs, and the back of your eyelids.\u00a0 It can be played   with a Controller  or with Mouse and Keyboard, so take your pick!</strong><br/>\n\n\n<p><strong>This game was made by Ground Bird, the indelible power team:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chloe Kilroy | Art Direction, 3D Character Art, UI Art, Concept Art</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Billy Dent | Programming, Production, Narrative Design, Sound Design, Cinematography</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zac Vincent | 3D Environment Art, Environment Design, Lighting</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Riley Baker | 3D Environment Art, Level Design, Cinematography</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tan Jin Feng | Character Rigging, Animation, UI Design, Sound Design</strong></p>\n<p><strong>William Mitchell | Writing, Narrative Design, 3D Environment Art</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Oscar Jenkin | Composing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Julian Smith-Gard | Composing</strong></p>\n<p>With special thanks to C\u00e9cile, Andy and Ari for helping with the itch page!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T11:02:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/091/091988d937e55565e8fc5b39fb0f9310.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Billy Dent", "Feng_the_Fern", "Ghij", "Boonie", "R1L3Z", "Zac Vincent"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
