The game\u00a0has been made as a little programming challenge on theC64 full size, combined with a disk image full of public domain utilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Storm Chase is a simple quality little dodge 'em game in which you are a fearless storm chaser. A giant magic grey cloud hovers over your village, pouring down with giant raindrops. Your quest is to guide your storm chaser and catch those magic rain drops and avoid letting the rain drops hit the ground, otherwise the river banks will start rising. Once the river bank reaches over the flood defence gates, you will lose a life.</p>\n<p>You will have a limited amount of rain drops to catch, in order to completely rescue your village. However, there are 16 levels to complete, and the cloud will occasionally fire out lightning bolts. Try not to get struck and enjoy the great outdoors.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:<br/><br/>Programming by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Graphics by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Music by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Tape Turbo loader source by\u00a0<strong>Martin Piper<br/></strong>Zap 'n Load loader game by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(C)\u00a02020 The New Dimension</strong></p>\n<p><em>Download not available until after Scene World #30 has been released.
