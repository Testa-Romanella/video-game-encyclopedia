Not even size. You can zoom in and out to see however much of the battle you need to. The troops that are deployable are hunters, medics, turrets, and motherships. There are two different fields to battle on, an asteroid belt and the cosmos. I hope you enjoy this game if you decide to purchase. It was created solely by me.</p>\n<p>**Now also checkout Protect the Tower. It is much more fun than this game, and it is only $0.99.**</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/901dbf549c1b26eb33848804beec0d27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stephen L."], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
