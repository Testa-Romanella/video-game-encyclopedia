Everything is going fine up until her long forgotten father reappears out of no where telling him that she's still alive. And just as quickly as it happened MC is forcibly pulled into another world to save his friend.</p>\n<p>Only the first Episode is available to\u00a0play in this demo. There is a planned steam demo that will be much higher quality and will resemble the final product.</p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER!!!</p>\n<p>I am aware that the game is a bit... meh, presentation wise. I'd prefer if you see this game as more of a visual novel than an RPG. Also sorry if the writing gets kind of cringe sometimes.
