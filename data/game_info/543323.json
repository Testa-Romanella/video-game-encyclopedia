There is A LOT that needs to be added, a UI, music/sound, and enemies that actually hurt you. The game stars Gecman, a man dressed like a gecko. I thought it would be a funny take on the cartoon animal clich\u00e9. Leave suggestions for the game, I'd really like your input! I'm still figuring this out, so to play, download the rom and run it in a Game Boy emulator. I'll figure out how to make a browser version sooner or later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:46:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e8/6e878bf0e40861efedf7ac68a22a4ecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["BradyChrisGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
