Based on the true events that eventually led to Captain Cook's death, enjoy this silly narrative-adventure peppered with mini-games that the Chief plays in order to fulfill various rituals.\r\n </p>\n<strong><em>How to Play the Mini-Games</em></strong>\r\n1. Catch that Coconut!\r\n<p>Move the Chief to the right and left to catch 20 of these coconuts.\r\n </p>\n<p>Avoid the coconut tree leaves!\r\n </p>\n<p>Press your arrow keys as they fall on these slit drums!\r\n </p>\n<p>Can you keep up with the beat?\r\n </p>\r\n2. Fervent Worship!\r\n<p>Run up to the altars that have an arrow over them.\r\n </p>\n<p>Once you reach the bottom of the altar, press the LMB button *on it*\u00a0for it to count!\r\n </p>\n<p>While avoiding the poles with skeletons on them, try to touch all 20 indicated altars within the time limit.\r\n </p>\r\n3. Keep em' Cookin'!\r\n<p><strong>Cook a feast worth having for Lono!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For 2 minutes, keep the fire on the underground stove going by adding leaves to it. Whenever the smoke goes down, it's time to run and grab some more.\r\n </p>\n<p>Sounds easy right? Not when the God you care about most is thirsty! Whenever you him sweat, it's time bring him a drink!\r\n </p>\n<strong><em>Jargon Used in the Game</em></strong>\n<ul> <li>Niu hiwa: black coconut\r\n </li><li>Pua\u2018a hiwa (black pig): ceremonial food of ka po\u2018e kahiko and also a kinolau of Lono\r\n </li><li>h\u014d'ailona: signs\r\n </li><li>Ho\u02bbokupu: Hawaiian language term for gifts and offerings Source:\u00a0http://www.protectkahoolaweohana.org/makahiki.html\r\n </li><li>Nou okoa Kukulu o Kahiki.
