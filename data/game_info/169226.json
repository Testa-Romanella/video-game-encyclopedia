At the end, this character is added to the world to enrich the game for future players. The game plays with the fact that aspects of identity are decided by the player, while other aspects are decided by others or left to chance.</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong><br/></p><p>Due to the APIs used, this will only run in Chrome. Sorry! Play it at https://storyofeveryone.herokuapp.com.<br/></p><p>Use WASD to move and other controls will be introduced as needed. In total the game will take around 15-20 minutes to complete. It involves contributing sound using your microphone so it's probably not appropriate to play this one at work :)</p><p><strong>Reception</strong><br/></p><p><strong>Winner of #rainbowjam16 \"Technical Prize\" for a game that \"has a fun and unique mechanic, and is a fun gaming experience\".</strong></p><p>Rated by other #rainbowjam16 entrants as 2nd overall, 1st for use of theme, and 3rd for fun.</p><p>Listed in Jupiter Hadley's #rainbowjam16 jam favourites</p><p><strong>\"</strong><em>Also I was born with a clown mask on, as the previous player used the hair designer tool to make a mask that covered his face instead of more conventional hair.
