The secret to its rejuvenation lay in crafting a potent anti-parasite concoction, that she can't hope to complete without help.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0The events that unfold, are a lesson in humility, and unintended consequences.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Controls\r\n   </p>\n<p>\u00a0(Standard RPGMaker fare)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Moving - W,A,S,D or Arrow Keys\r\n  </p>\n<p>Interaction - SPACE or Enter\r\n  </p>\n<p>Cancel/Exit - X\r\n  </p>\n<p>Open Menu - X\r\n  </p>\n<p>Scroll - PAGE-UP / DOWN or Q / E\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0Also allows mouse use.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What To Expect\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0Unfortunately, I am no digital artist, and trying to piece together tile sets from available community assets would have seriously restricted the time I had available to make this, so it relies exclusively on <strong>RTP</strong>, and a few extra tiles that were necessary (though perhaps a bit odd) to make things work in a pinch. <br/></p>\n<p>Also, I wasn't sure how to officially end the game... So, you're left at the Main Menu in game until you choose to save/return to title, etc...<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0I <strong>really </strong>hope you enjoy this\u00a0as\u00a0much\u00a0or\u00a0more than\u00a0I\u00a0did\u00a0making\u00a0it!\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Important Note!\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0I implore you, that if you have anything to say about this project, please do!   </p>\n<p>\u00a0No amount of feedback is too little, nor too much. Good, or bad, I would love it all.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0I can\u2019t hope to improve what I'm unaware of.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0So please, even if you think it's obvious, or someone else already mentioned it, please tell me anyway!   </p>\n<p>\u00a0Repeating an issue, reinforces it's importance, and even the most unusual feedback can have real value! So believe me, I want you to <strong>BE CRITICAL!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<p>There appears to be a totally intermittent issue (only happened once) with the <strong>crafting plugin</strong> causing status violations, on exiting it. I am unsure if it only happened because it was in test mode. If it happens, a recent Auto Save, should be enough to get past.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0Flirion - Animal Characters</p>\n<p>Darren Curtis - Music</p>\n<p>whtdragon - Bird Characters\r\n  </p>\n<p>Coelocanth - Plugins  </p>\n<p>Visustella - Plugins\r\n  </p>\n<p>Caethyril - Plugins\r\n  </p>\n<p>Avery - Icons &amp; Tiles <br/></p>\n<p>Leander Font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T13:33:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/387/38729ced5a1d2f2f1fb655ac3e71cb42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RogueDeus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
