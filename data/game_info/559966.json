Or you can <strong>git gud</strong>. The <strong>choice is yours</strong> ;-)</p>\n<p>This <strong>game </strong>was <strong>designed </strong>and <strong>developed </strong>during the <strong>Global Game Jam 2021</strong>.\u00a0<br/>The <strong>theme </strong>was <strong>Lost and Found</strong> (which we interpreted as <strong>losing and finding controls</strong>) and we used the <strong>RNG </strong><strong>diversifier </strong>in which you <strong>randomize things usually not randomized\u00a0</strong>(in our case the <strong>key bindings</strong>).<br/><br/>Let us know if you played and enjoyed the game and <strong>post </strong>a <strong>screenshot </strong>of the <strong>ending </strong>scene containing the time and mode you finished the game with :-)<br/><br/><strong>Credits:<br/>Marco Farina\u00a0</strong>- Game &amp; Level Designer;<br/><strong>Riccardo Lombardi\u00a0</strong>- Game &amp; Sound Designer;<br/><strong>Giacomo Romanello\u00a0</strong>- Game Designer &amp; Programmer;<br/><strong>Davide Valentini\u00a0</strong>- Game Designer &amp; Programmer.<br/><strong><br/>Free assets used:<br/></strong>https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-industrial-tileset<br/>https://www.dafont.com/04b-03.font<br/>https://github.com/keijiro/KinoGlitch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:17:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/337/337837fe50c2d6dcde70443234a4fe3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LombRicc", "Davide Valentini", "MarcoPown", "Cubond"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
