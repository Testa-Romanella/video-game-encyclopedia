As long as you're in the zone, you get points! You have a gun which shoots blasts that, upon explosion, knock the ball away. Use this to return it to your control from afar, or push it out to a safer place.</p><p>---<br/></p><p>This project was uploaded for \"My First Game Jam (1/16/16)\" and I had quite a bit of fun with it. Some life stuff happened so I didn't get as much time as I'd have liked, but I went from knowing 0% Unity and C# to making what you're (hopefully) playing here.</p><p>It's sort of a 2D (super) demake of a game I created in Halo: Reach with the help of some friends. It's SUPPOSED to be multiplayer, but I didn't have time to figure that out/test, so it's this for now. One day, I'll make my own version of it, 3D and everything. Until then, I've got this, haha.</p><p>Thanks for playing! &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T12:52:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b9/9b9f08e1e985c932577f07cc2bab38c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 43, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Emessai"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
