There are marked positions that correlate to a poker hand on the screen. Once enough cards are added to a hand it will be compared with the dealer's hand. If all of your hands beat the dealer then you win the match!<h3>How to Play</h3><br/>Push cards:<br/><br/><br/>When pushed into a slot the card is added to a hand<br/><br/><br/>Once a hand is completed it will be compared with the dealer<br/><h3>You cannot </h3><br/> Push more than one card<br/><br/><br/> Pull cards<br/><h3>Wild</h3><br/>Wild cards can take the place of any other card. It makes creating poker hands more challenging.
