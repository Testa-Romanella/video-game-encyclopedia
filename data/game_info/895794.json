Heavily inspired by the hacking minigame in NieR:Automata.\u00a0Dash your way through the 3\u00a0available levels and try to get the fastest time and the fewest deaths.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a project i worked on for\u00a0only a few weeks for my studies, and as a result the game is still very early in development. I am planning on adding a fourth level as well as some extra features, such as a local\u00a0 high scores screen, or tweaking around the dash, cause it feels wonky at times.</p>\n<p>Feedback is greatly appreciated.\u00a0Have fun and feel free to share your scores.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(note : the music in the trailer isn't in the game, it's from Touhou 17.5)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T16:41:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06b/06baffbefed31739fc757c5b062aa6b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["captN Bill"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
