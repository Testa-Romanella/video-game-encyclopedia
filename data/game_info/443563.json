I also made a central mechanic, \"Reflex Meter\", which is slow-mo activated while a button is held down. This was made in order to allow the player some levity when in sticky situations. Additionally, I added a health bar. If points get by the player, it chips down at the players health. Once the player's health reaches 0, it's game over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T04:54:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38a007059f2fb54e0603bf9c9d9605f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mattmer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
