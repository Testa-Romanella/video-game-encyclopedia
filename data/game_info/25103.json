In Sonic and the Secret Rings, Sonic finds \n      himself in the colorful and vibrant world of the Arabian Nights tales. \n      There he embarks on his most outrageous journey to date through an \n      expansive 3D world brought to life with realistic water reflections, \n      light bloom, and lifelike physics.\n    </p><p>\n      Sonic and the Secret Rings makes custom use of the innovative Wii remote \n      to create a truly immersive gaming experience. Mimicking the energy and \n      movements of Sonic, players actively perform specialized moves with the \n      controller, bringing their stamina and wide range of motion into the \n      action! Players will hurtle Sonic forward by rotating the controller \n      from side to side and perform combo moves with a flick of the wrist. \n      This, combined with a dizzying sense of speed, will quickly draw players \n      of all ages into the action!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-22T00:00:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f15/f152c0887aa83b5cd362caf8a594518a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.23, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 13, "beaten": 20, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 26, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 62, "reviews_count": 26, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
