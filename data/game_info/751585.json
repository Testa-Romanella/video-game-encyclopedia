And music generator actually uses some knowledge of music theory. Now it generates MIDIs either in major or minor scale.</p>\n<p>Now gameplay is more complicated that block-sliding puzzle. There're still some crates to push, but now you can destroy crates. Sometimes they drop some nice bonuses.</p>\n<p>Monsters can push and destroy crates too. And yes, monsters. They attack everything they see. You, other monsters, and crates. They also really like to pick up the bonus you wanted to pick up. Monsters drop some loot when killed. Each time you get to the next level monsters get stronger.</p>\n<p>Game is kinda luck based. You can just have no white orbs and be defenceless against all monsters. Or you can get black cube just when you had 3 hp left.</p>\n<p>Enjoy playing or not playing this game</p>\n<p>(Btw, game has no storyline at all. So you can make any game-theory about it and they all will be equally true)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/916/916384c73634806eafc56009c128fa37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IvanovTV"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
