In each one you have to find a way to open the portal by enlisting the help of the people who live in the world, while not getting them eaten by monsters or blown up by landmines.<br/><br/><strong>Hapland</strong>, <strong>Hapland 2</strong> and <strong>Hapland 3</strong> have all been remastered in HD with beautiful 60FPS animation. Each game has also been enhanced with extra secrets to discover.<br/><br/><strong>Detailed Gameplay Description:</strong><br/><br/>All three Hapland games are point-and-click games, which means you use your mouse to point and click on objects and people in a scene. When you click on things, they move around or perform actions, sometimes changing the state of the world. For example, clicking on a person might cause the person to walk to a different location. If you can find the right sequence of actions to perform in order to realize your goal, which in all three Hapland games means opening the magic portal, then you win.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T05:19:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de6/de6bd08f6d045578df63d0424aa2dd4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robin Allen"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Robin Allen"], "esrb_rating": null}
