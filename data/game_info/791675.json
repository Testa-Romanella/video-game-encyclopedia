Choose from <strong>30 different animals</strong> to assemble your team. Each character has different attributes which are categorized by <strong>STRENGTH</strong>, <strong>SPEED</strong>, <strong>AGILITY</strong>, <strong>TECHNIQUE</strong><br/><br/>Controls are responsive and easy to learn. <strong>Crush </strong>hits into the gap, <strong>throw </strong>nasty curveballs, make <strong>diving </strong>plays in the outfield, and bust out <strong>slides </strong>to breakup close plays.<br/><br/>But don't expect all the same rules as traditional baseball. In this game, there is no need for foul balls or tagging up. Put the ball in play and see what unfolds! Lots of opportunities for <strong>aggressive baserunning</strong> and <strong>slick fielding</strong>. And of course, <strong>intense pitcher vs batter matchups</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Future features plan to have:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>multiple fields to play at<br/></li><li>12+ unlockable characters<br/></li><li>animal teammate chemistry<br/></li><li>more stats/record keeping<br/></li><li>postgame MVPs and boxscore <br/></li><li>homerun derby, practice mode<br/></li><li>spectator mode (for online matches)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T06:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/814/814227bcf302b8f9035c211cc464fa3c.jpg", "website": "https://greenvalleygames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Green Valley Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hadzin Foundation"], "esrb_rating": null}
