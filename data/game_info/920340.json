This is Earth's only defense against the incoming invaders, once this falls... Earth falls.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\n<p>This game was created as my first ever University Unity Game Assignment. The game had to use one button only so that it in theory could work on mobile. The controls are</p>\n<p>Up - Jump/Move ship up<br/>Hold Up - Flip between left &amp; right of screen<br/>Leave Up Released - Automatically fall downwards</p>\r\nPC Port Changes\r\n\n<p>As this was my first ever Unity game it had extremely poor code and hardly worked in the latest version of Unity. Inputs and timers were in the fixed update and a lot of code was dependant on the game running at a specific framerate. This meant that the games spawns, shooting and physics were completely broken. I've fixed the game up to get it working, though there may be balance/difficulty changes because of this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T10:15:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c7/5c761f6566ddc185acb691d2a89bf747.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TomPoucherGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
