ARE YOU UP TO THE TASK?<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Welcome to HooperVania, a free and non-profit French fan-game celebrating Castlevania, the French videomaker Hooper, his community and video games as a whole! Navigate through various stages using the famous Vampire Killer to defeat numerous enemies, large bosses and ultimately vanquish Dracula himself!</p>\n<p>Although it does countain its amount of private jokes within the Hooper community, I believe the game stands well on its own and you should know most references as they are either about famous video games or pop-culture.</p>\n<p>A team of around 15+ people worked hard to make this a reality, with several level-designers, artists and lots of playtest. I hope you will enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed making it!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>STORY<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Hooper regularly streams video games playthrough, with a special tradition: each December 31st, to celebrate the new year, he plays a new episode of Castlevania. Since he started in 2009, he has already kicked Dracula's ass a dozen of times!</p>\n<p>This time, however, Dracula has had enough. Using his mystical powers, he fusions his world with Hooper's, and challenges him to a fair one-on-one fight.</p>\n<p>Now, it is your time to shine! Play as Hooper wielding the whip of the Belmont Family to thwart Dracula's plans once and for all!</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY<br/></strong></p>\n<p>HooperVania's gameplay is pretty close to those of the original Castlevania series (before Symphony Of The Night). Move, jump, crawl, use the whip and other secondary weapons to vanquish your foes!</p>\n<p>Gamepads are commonly supported, but the game comes with JoyToKey to allow you to fully customize your experience. It is also playable on the keyboard just fine!</p>\n<p>Default controls and abilities are detailled in the instructions booklet bundled with the game in the downloads below!</p><p><strong>DEFAULT CONTROLS\u00a0(Keyboard/Gamepad)</strong></p><p>- Move: Arrow Keys / Left Stick or D-Pad<br/>- Jump/Validate: X / \"A\" Button on X360<br/>- Whip/Cancel: C / \"X\" Button on X360<br/>- Secondary weapon: B/\"B\" Button on X360<br/>- Fury: V/\"Y\" Button on X360<br/>- Change secondary weapon: + or - (numpad) / \"RB\" and \"LB\" trigger buttons on X360<br/>- Pause: Return / \"Start\" button on X360<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>LANGUAGES<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Being a French game, HooperVania comes in both French and English version.
