This is my first ever project, and I've spent nearly a year working on it while learning code/game design. In Hell's Abyss, your goal is to survive and accumulate as many points as possible. Limited ammunition and a non-regenerating health system will be your biggest obstacles, next to the killer zombies, when it comes to survival. There are multiple game modes (normal and Arcade Abyss, which is a top-down version of the game), which are guaranteed to give you many hours of gameplay! To anyone reading this, thanks for checking out my game, and I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efd8f37b32b572debaf1a4c0a7a586c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Wiest"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
