It's easy to learn, but hard to master. Precise aiming and expert platforming are required to come out on top.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Piss off is made for friends who want\u00a0to laugh, scream, and party.\u00a0Don't worry, it's not a kinky thing, unless you want it to be ;)</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, at this point a controller is required to play, BUT the game is <strong>still in development</strong>, so a single player\u00a0mode and will come in the future.</p>\n\n<p>If you like Piss Off, join the GHOSTMEAT PARTY PALACE on Discord, where we can test the game together, hang out, and party! It's not just my server, its\u00a0a game development community, so join and share things that you're working on!</p>\n\n<p>Song Credits:</p>\n<p>\"To A Theater Near You\", CertainlyCaro\u00a0https://certainlycaro.newgrounds.com/</p>\n<p>\"Challenger\", HOJL\u00a0https://hojl.newgrounds.com/<br/></p>\n<p>\"Power Move\" , James the Mutt\u00a0https://jamesthemuttz.newgrounds.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T12:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e0/5e05c411c79235ea90b0ae607fb96c8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GHOSTMEAT"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
