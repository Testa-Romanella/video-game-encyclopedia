Cards cost\u00a0<strong><em>mana</em><em>\u00a0</em></strong>to be cast. <em>Minions</em> can be cast on the board and have an attack (indicated by the sword and shield) and health point (indicated by heart)\u00a0values.</li><li>Your <strong><em>mana</em></strong> is on the right side of your portrait. You get 1 point per turn, indicated by the small spheres.\u00a0Your mana replenishes at every turn.</li><li>You can click and drag <strong><em>Cards</em></strong> towards the board to cast them. They will use the <strong><em>mana</em></strong> indicated by the top left corner. After you run out of <strong><em>mana</em></strong>, click \"End Turn\" on the right side of the screen.</li><li>Your minions can only attack on the turn after they're cast. Minions that are ready to attack are indicated by a glow around them.\u00a0To attack, click on the minion and drag towards the target. Minions marked as \"Protector\"\u00a0(indicated by having a shield around them) need to be attacked before you can attack anything else.\u00a0Minions can only attack once per turn.</li><li>To win, you must make the opponent's HP reach 0. To attack the opponent, target the portrait in the middle of the board, opposite to you.</li></ol>\n<p>Hopefully this and the UX\u00a0helps!</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>CC art by:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>al0sral0</li><li>FlukierJupiter</li><li>Jamie McFarlane</li><li>Ole Gunnar Isager</li><li>Font: Yeseva One</li><li>\"Ghost Processional\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)</li><li>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T02:40:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcf/bcffa608e35de8624b7139c83722d1be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yanko Oliveira"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
