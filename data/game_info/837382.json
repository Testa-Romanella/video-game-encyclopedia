It features:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fantasy world of rock and ice:</strong>\u00a0Everything in this game is made of either rock or ice or both. Character abilities also require these resources to perform. The game time is represented in terms of day with simple day/night cycle to enhance the world liveliness.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Original pixel art:</strong>\u00a0The game art is originally designed and beautifully rendered by Unity Universal Rendering Pipeline.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>High quality music and sound effects:</strong>\u00a0Music and sound effects are carefully chosen to fit the game theme.\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>Intuitive RPG\u2019s UI design with easy-to-follow game guides:</strong>\u00a0UI is designed around the main components of the game, and provides you with enough game information in order to progress.

Q:\u00a0What\u2019s the purpose of this section?</strong></p>\n<p>A: This section presents some information about my game development process. It serves as a way for me to document my process as well as communicating with players about the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Q: How long does it take to develop this game?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It takes me about 2 weeks to develop this game independently, which includes designing the game, making art assets and coding.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Q: How did this project start?</strong></p>\n<p>A: This project started as a way for me to test my skills and to prepare for a bigger project.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>4.\u00a0</strong><strong>Q: What does this game mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Comparing to other RPGs, this is not a big game. It has only one main quest. The total gameplay time can be about 30 minutes or less. However, to develop this within 2 weeks, it takes me years of experience and hard work. This project is special comparing to my other projects, because this time, I want to do it the right way from a single line of code to a game system, and I really enjoy the process.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>5.\u00a0Q: Is there anything you want to tell players before playing this game?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Relax and enjoy the game. I playtested the game as I developed it, so everything should work as expected if you don\u2019t intentionally break the game haha.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T14:33:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a505e0cca22e2d9a3550f44c96108a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Over-Dramatics"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
