You can see in the first and last areas just so the player can get used to their character a bit and see the minor \"ending\", so they know to quit the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Coded in Unity and it's my first real game. It's severely lacking in content but I think I'll fix that in the future. It was quite the struggle just getting the mechanics working the way I wanted them to, or else I would have included more in areas like Menu, levels, general design.<br/></p>\n<p>While looking to see if this idea's been done, I've seen it a couple of times in 3D, but not in 2D. It was quite the learning experience and I hope it's received well.</p>\n<p>Any comments or advice is appreciated. Let me know what you'd like to see if I expanded this game in the future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/777/7774911ae7851c6f4f75fb67b39a8165.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamshaper"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
