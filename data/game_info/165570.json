Get out there and charge some batteries!</p>\n<p>Featuring music by the lovely Chimeratio! The soundtrack is available on SoundCloud for listening outside of the game.</p>\n<p>I recommend reading the in-game help, because the win condition for puzzles is a little weird and I'm not sure it can easily be figured out just by messing around. But maybe you have way better things to do than read like 700 words? I totally understand. In that case, <strong>the important stuff is on page 9</strong>. At least glance at that\u00a0before you jump in, so you'll have a vague idea of what you're trying to do.</p>\n<p>Controls: point the mouse at things and click. Some things you can drag too, if that's more comfortable for you.</p>\n<p>Note: even though this game features a cheap iPad ripoff UI, <strong>it doesn't actually support touch</strong>. Sorry!</p>\n<p>You don't want to look at the source code, which is over here: https://bitbucket.org/CHz16/charge-cycles. Full attribution for the assets I didn't make is over there too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce689ab6d34060dbd9a209cb2d2f1f4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CHz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
