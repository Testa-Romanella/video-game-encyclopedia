Domynyo is playable both in First Person and Third Person, depending on players preferences. Domynyo is NOT a pay to win. The player will be able to purchase in-game content but that won\u2019t give any sort of advantages, it will just make your character look more pretty (if you have good taste)!<br/><br/><strong>MAIN THEMES AND LOOK?</strong><br/><br/>Post-apocalyptic and Abandoned<br/>environments are the protagonists of the First Season.<br/>Dark environments, debris, creepy lcoations in a 4k world.<br/><br/>We thought dynamic lightning and weather is a must! The day-night cycle and climate conditions will influence the game to the point that you could find yourself in the dark seeking for a torch and praying for the storm to end (while trying not to get shot)!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T01:59:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04f839fc2a6a31bebc1dab290f136b6c.jpg", "website": "https://www.domynyo.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 632, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Domynyo"], "genres": ["Action", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Domynyo"], "esrb_rating": null}
