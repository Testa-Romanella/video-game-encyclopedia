{"id": 650865, "slug": "super-shield-dash", "name": "Super Shield Dash", "name_original": "Super Shield Dash", "description": "Super Shield Dash, like every game leads by the word \"Super\", is an arcade game with a simple goal: beat that highscore while smashing endless hordes of enemies. <br/><br/><br/><br/>What sets it apart is the slow-motion effect, where time moves as you move. No powerups, no fancy weapons. Just you simply dashing around, throwing shield to destroy enemies. So plant your feet, grit your teeth and eat those horses.<br/><br/>Instead of the ol' goody guns or sword, you find yourself equipped with shields, lots of shields which you can throw at the very face of every enemy. The shield will travel as far as it can then return to its owner while still maintaining its full power, combining with the slow-mo effect for a massive arcade feeling.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T14:13:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a107a51b2b1ad2b81e639268507decf.jpg", "website": "https://brucesgame.com/super-shield-dash/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bruce Nguyen"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bruce Nguyen"], "esrb_rating": null}
