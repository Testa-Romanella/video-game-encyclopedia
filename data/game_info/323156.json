Will you make it to the final showdown, where players are finally granted their prizes, life, and freedom? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTest your aim &amp; skills with the ball by shooting enemies directly -- or scoring by shooting at hoops, buttons, and spinners that activate turrets, traps and unlock power-ups with your Sonic Ball Gun. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cBalls Out\u201d pits players against each other and the show, with tricks shots, combos &amp; physics-based shooting that is easy to learn but hard to master.
