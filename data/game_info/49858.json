Who would blow a bigger balloon - a toothless granny or a sumo fighter? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time to find out?<br/><br/>Your main goal is to make the right bubblegum balloon. Not too small or it will flop and not too large or it will blast in your face. Make it perfect and you\u2019ll get a combo multiplier and the leaderboard will be yours. Beware though, the higher combo you score, the more difficult the game will get!<br/><br/>There are over 20 heroes to pick from. Each one of them is a real bubblegum aficionado and playing as a different hero is where the joy comes from. Especially when you pop the balloon and the gum blasts all over your face!<br/><br/>As you may have expected, gums are the most crucial items in this game. On each world, you draw from a different gumball. Each of the gums has a different name, flavor, and skin, as well as properties like points, speed, perfect, range &amp; cash. <br/><br/>In BubbleGum Hero there's also a 'real life mode'! In settings, you can change the mode and literally blow into the microphone. Guess what, you will blow the balloon from within the game! That\u2019s something to show off at the next party!<br/><br/>Features: <br/>- Easy to grasp controls <br/>- Simple and addictive gameplay <br/>- 5 different worlds to unlock <br/>- 15 characters and funny animations to unlock <br/>- 30 bubble gums with different characteristics <br/>- Stunning graphics and animations <br/>- Music &amp; sounds seamlessly adapting to the current world <br/>- Online Leaderboards and Achievements <br/>- Realistic mode  - play by blowing into the microphone <br/>- Apple Watch mini game <br/><br/>-----------------------------<br/>NEWSLETTER<br/>http://www.crimsonpine.com/newsletter/<br/><br/>FOLLOW<br/>https://www.facebook.com/crimsonpine<br/>https://twitter.com/crimsonpine<br/><br/>DISCOVER<br/>http://www.crimsonpine.com/<br/><br/>SUPPORT<br/>Are you having problems?
