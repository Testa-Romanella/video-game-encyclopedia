We\u2019re so happy to have you back.</p>\n<p>After your month-long absence, we\u2019re really glad to see you again. We also hope you\u2019re ready to get stuck in, as we have an assignment for you. If you could check through the attached powerpoint for typos and issues, that would be great. A nice simple task to get you settled back in- just ignore the mysterious disappearance of the guy who made it, and the fact that no one will talk about where he went, even though he\u2019s right here-\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2026Our apologies. That won\u2019t happen again.\r\n</p>\n<p>Regardless, we hope you enjoy your time here with the company. We value transparency above all else- so surely you\u2019d know if we were hiding something, right?\r\n</p>\n<p>Right. Let\u2019s get to work.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Before you play:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You need to run a script for this game to work! The script will get flagged by Windows Defender but we promise it\u2019s not a virus. In the interests of transparency, you can read the code here (but spoilers beware!)\r\n</p>\n<p>To get past the Windows Defender warning, click \u201csee more\u201d and then click \u201crun anyway\u201d.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please read the readme before you start! Not only does it have important instructions, but it\u2019s also important for worldbuilding reasons. (The best reasons, in our opinion!)\r\n</p>\n<p>Also, this is a game made in powerpoint- try not to scroll down or it\u2019ll ruin the magic. You\u2019ll also need to have powerpoint installed to play.\r\n</p>\n<p>And, finally, this is a horror game that discusses ideas of body horror and unethical medical experiments. If you find either of those uncomfortable, please don\u2019t play.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>A game made in PowerPoint (novel)\r\n</li><li>A whole bunch of original art (pretty)\r\n</li><li>Some spooks and scares (aaa!)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This game was made as part of the Games Innovation Challenge 2022. This is more of a demo/experimental game than a full-length completed game! A completed \u00a0version is planned to be released in the future. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T06:21:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ceb/cebecd9a455025910269825a8a351c02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rougete", "emmy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
