This is where you meet Bess, you give her a conveniently placed flower,\u00a0and the plot dictates that the two of you instantly fall in love. Your mission becomes to explore the map and find a big score. But, as it always does for wanted men,\u00a0trouble arises.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will you steal the big score? Will you get the girl? Will any of the dialogue make sense?\u00a0Find out by playing this super short game adaptation of an early 20th century love ballad!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T02:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aad/aad7cdfdcee8c786f9a3df7f047f9f90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Caden Nebel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
