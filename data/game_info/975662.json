Digitized sound, Animations, and a ten-man crew to talk you through the tough ones.<br/><br/><br/>And so it goes for twenty-five missions, Assuming, of course, you make it home from this one.<h3>You are in control</h3>Put yourself in the captain\u2019s seat of a B-17 bomber, select your plane, select your crew and plot your path over war-torn Europe. Watch your elevation, watch your formation, and watch very carefully where you were over the target. This classic was a bestseller in the early 1990s.<h3>Deadly Games Classic Reborn</h3>Staying true to its original HyperCard heritage the core game will look and feel the same as Rene Vidmer's original, but the game will be delivered on an updated engine.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T07:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac5/ac5c57d69811b14fb49ed6b1740ab196.jpg", "website": "http://www.microprose.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicroProse Software", "Deadly Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["MicroProse"], "esrb_rating": null}
