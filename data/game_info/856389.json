What type of adventure? .....Man, you tell me.</p>\n<p>It is my first time doing a story based exploration game and making a comedic game this short might be good enough.</p>\n<p>This game was made with RPG Maker MV and while the concept and some of the pixel art was made a long while ago (particularly the character sprites), everything else was done under a month (Yes, even the music.).</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to TenshiHanka for giving me the extra push to finally work on this game!</p>\n<p>(The Windows and Mac Versions are only uploaded. I will upload the rest soon. It was just taking forever, I'm sorry!! ;;.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T05:28:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/11351be741161bf9b3caab6584bdf1f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GissyEva"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
