Bushes combat pollution and generate seeds + drop health. Bushes produce charcoal on being killed which can be used to gain charge.</p>\n<p>Game starts with Player and a few factories.\u00a0Enemy comes in after 60 seconds.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Concept, design, dev, assets and music\u00a0-\u00a0Poonam and Piyush.</p>\n<p>We stand on the shoulders of amazing work done by a lot of amazing\u00a0people.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Humble Bundle provided the Unity Bundle\u00a0that led us down this path.</li><li>Terry Cavanagh\u00a0made the\u00a0amazing Bosca Coeil\u00a0for music.</li><li>ephtracy made\u00a0 our lives easy with \u00a0Magica Voxel.</li><li>YouTube tutorial videos, especially ones from Brackeys.</li><li>The makers of Blender and Unity.</li></ul>\n<p>This is our first game!\u00a0 A lot of mistakes were made and things learnt during the course of this month.<br/><br/>We hope you get as frustrated\u00a0playing it as we did making it :D<br/><br/><strong>Source code:</strong> https://github.com/ofpiyush/EcoFighter</p>\n<p>Tested working on Windows 64-bit\u00a0and Mac, need someone to confirm working linux builds.<br/><br/>If you liked the game,\u00a0vote for us here :\u00a0\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018/rate/336431</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb8/eb8a357998b0ef60bb1730aa5189be19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ofpiyush", "Poonam"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
