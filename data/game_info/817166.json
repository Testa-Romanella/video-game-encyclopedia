New fun ways to play the game abound! Can you find the easter egg?</p>\n<p>Note that the number of rooms is 8 total in a 2x2x2 cube. You start off on the bottom \"floor\" in the back left of the map. Move in the plane of the screen with either WASD or the arrow keys. Pressing \"E\" takes you up a floor and pressing \"Q\" takes you down a floor. I've helpfully displayed your current floor in the top left corner of the screen and put red boundaries where the death zone is. Don't try to go below floor 0 or above floor 1. You will die.</p>\n<p>Press \"R\" at the Game Over screen to restart.</p>\n<p>Credit for the pygame snake image goes to @Sjmarf#1894 on Discord</p>\n<p>Credit for the music goes to\u00a0https://www.fakemusicgenerator.com/<br/></p>\n\n<p>GitHub repository at\u00a0https://github.com/oddbookworm/PGC-July-2022-Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T11:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/1133b95604f70b2dc742787361c79c47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Coffey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
