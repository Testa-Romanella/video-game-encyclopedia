Finding new items and abilities will unlock paths until you uncover 100% of the world map.</p>\n<p>This is currently a prototype, so don't expect too much from it. There are only a few screens, and still a lot of bugs. My current goal is to have the combat and exploration mechanics ready.\u00a0The game will improve as I publish updates adding new levels and enemies.<br/><br/>Developing a game for the Genesis is not an easy thing.\u00a0This game is created using SGDK and Gendev that allow using the C language. It wouldn't exists without the hard work of the developers of this devkit.<br/><br/>Of course inspiration is taken from many games that have a special place in my heart: Wonder Boy, Cave Story, Momodora, Rogue Legacy, Touhou, Alex Kidd, Sonic, Secret of Mana, and many more.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm not really trying to be innovative, but recreate a classic game on a classic console. If the game ends up having a nice progression, nice cute graphics and enchanting music, I may consider taking the efforts to release it on cartridge. But we're not there yet :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:07:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c1/5c1ad9880a0c59e887aa9ce463f79b4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kivutaro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
