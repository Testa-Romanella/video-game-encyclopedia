In this world a sausage is the size of a bus, a burger is the size of a small swimming pool and you may encounter dangerous toy scissors cutting their way through the middle of the track.<br />\nOutrace your opponents\u2026 or crush them to scrap! You can fight them up close or use one of the many power-ups scattered throughout the race. Unlock and collect the 20 toy cars, each with their own statistics, by playing through career mode and then improve them by installing upgrades or changing their paintjobs.<br />\nIn the end this game is sure to do one thing for you: revive that crazy larger than life feeling of playing with toy cars when you were a kid.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-16T15:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c4/1c4d6dc937f2a801ae77930f731edc6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 388, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Eclipse Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Eclipse Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
