Without a planet's magnetic field, high-energy particles from the sun and space, also known as plasma energy coming from the solar wind, hit the star's surface. But the King of Alexania doesn't care. Despite knowing because he believes in his science and abilities that if he can possess the energy of the entire star, he will be able to create a magnetosphere, which is a neighborhood with high-power magnets around it. It increases the energy of the magnetosphere that originally covered the surrounding planet. The stars are so powerful that they can block plasma energy coming from the solar wind. And he himself will be able to take over this planet.<br/><br/>--------------------<br/>Main Features<br/>--------------------<br/>- Melee Battle<br/><br/><br/>- Inventory System<br/><br/><br/>- Quest System<br/><br/><br/>- Cooking System<br/><br/><br/>- Skill System<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T04:55:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa0c8f2b875db52e26a133abf7a4b68b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PordeeHouse"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["PordeeHouse"], "esrb_rating": null}
