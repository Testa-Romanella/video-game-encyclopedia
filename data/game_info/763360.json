At the same time there is also human <strong>drama between the characters, telling a spectacular story</strong>.\"</p>\n<p>And do you know what, <strong>to the casual market they're right.</strong></p>\n<p>So Advance Dating By Web is not completed yet. The goal is to make an<strong> integrated dating simulator</strong>, where <strong>the actions you make in the dating sim portion and the connections you make between characters also effect the stats and gameplay of the strategy game portion.</strong> Gaining compatibility with characters in the dating sim will raise stats and synergies for some characters, making them stronger in some strategy game modes, and automatically shifting gameplay to suit which characters they prefer.</p>\n<p>And vise versa; the <strong>amount of time you play, which characters you primarily use, how many units you destroy, etc, will all affect your life and relationships with others in the Dating Sim.</strong>\u00a0And consistent gameplay overtime also gives item perks, special events, and hidden backstories within the dating sim.</p>\n<p>AWBW Subreddit</p>\n<p>Discord Invite<br/></p>\n<p>Main ADBW Devs: Red-Halo &amp; Radio Kitty Productions, <br/></p>\n<p>Art: Mason, Zelly, Greyghost, Emerie, Red-Halo, Red Jams, KingRex</p>\n<p>Coding: Red-Halo, TheGamerASD, Mathblitz</p>\n<p>Additional Help and Thanks to: Matsuzen, DPSI, Jay Embee, Lost &amp; Found, MorganLeah, Walker, Chucklefish, Xmo5, <br/></p>\n<p>Music: Patrick de Arteaga, patrickdearteaga.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T22:21:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19e/19ed179a3a696d40b73f3a79cee79d6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GloriousRed-Halo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
