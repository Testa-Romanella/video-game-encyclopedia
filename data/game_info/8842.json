{"id": 8842, "slug": "rogue-touch", "name": "Rogue Touch", "name_original": "Rogue Touch", "description": "Rogue Touch is based on the classic dungeon crawler Rogue. This famous turn based adventure-RPG has been re-designed from the ground up for easy touch screen gaming, no crazy keyboard commands or dozens of hard to learn gestures here! Rogue Touch is so simple a child can play, but still offers deeply strategic gameplay and literally hundreds of hours of fun and replay value!<br/><br/>Your mission is simple: Explore the Dungeons of Doom while trying to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor... Descend into the depths, find and identify strange and powerful items... Learn how to use your pack full of equipment effectively against increasingly dangerous monsters. Few have made it out alive with the Amulet. Do you have what it takes? <br/><br/>If you liked games such as Torneko / \u30c8\u30eb\u30cd\u30b3 / Taloon or Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer (Chunsoft) you have to play Rogue Touch! Rogue is the great-grandfather of these games and spawned an entire genre of \"roguelikes\" over nearly 40 years.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>\"Rogue Touch is really a dream-come-true for fans of the genre.  It's an impressive adaptation of a true classic.\" - Blake Patterson, TouchArcade.com<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/><br/>Rogue Touch features:<br/>- Random dungeon layouts and items: no two games are ever the same!<br/>- Graphical, animated actions, special monster attacks, traps, and more.<br/>- Ambient background dungeon sounds, or play your own music while gaming. <br/>- Auto-mapping feature with map overlay (including locations of doors, stairs, monsters and items)!<br/>- Streamlined inventory-item-action system for simple touch gameplay.
