Well some things have changed since we last spoke. As you may or may not know, gates to hell are opening all over. The Great Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Empire State Building, Stonehenge, and Vatican city. The demons that exit these gateways are all looking for one thing. The Pope, Saint Shermund. I assume you know what to do, but i will explain it anyway. Protect the pope. Don't let a single demon lay their hands on that man. You are the best we got, John. Don't fail us.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T05:50:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1e/c1e9cc847e31a5c06ff8b26971b4b168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Valkospyre"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
