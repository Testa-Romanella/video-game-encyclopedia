But I do hope you guys like, as I worked really hard on it *3*<br/></p>\n<p>The story: Ellie gets to her freshman year at college and all she wants is to have a peaceful year to focus on her studies. She really wants to keep it to herself and stay out of trouble, as she had enough of that already. She them finds out her roommate is extremely loud and loooves to party, which crashes her entire dream of having a calm year. The thing is, her roommate's best friend, Violet, is the most beautiful girl Ellie has ever seen, and as much as she wants to stay away from any thing that might get her in trouble, she just can't seem to stay away from Violet.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Characters were created by me :D\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming was also done by me.</p>\n<p>The amazing music was created by @MaySama, she also accepted to keep working on this novel with me, so she'll create some really great music for it!
