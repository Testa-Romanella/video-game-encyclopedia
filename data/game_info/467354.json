I used an XBoxOne controller to test it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Move: Left joystick\u00a0 on controller</p>\n<p>Jump: A button on controller</p>\n<p>Attack: B button on controller</p>\n<p>Reset/Push Button: Y button on controller</p>\n<p>The awsd and arrow keys work for moving the player, but there is no jump or attack keys assigned, only on the gamepad. If you really want to challenge yourself you can try passing it with just the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Game Play:</p>\n<p>Everything is out of control! Your Bunnies have wondered off the boat\u00a0 and you have to get them back and get out before the island residents throw you off and keep them delicious rabbits to themselves.\u00a0 You're a rabbit that doesn't know how to swim so avoid the water! Get all three of your bunnies and get back on that boat and vamoose!\u00a0 Your little bunnies want to play so they'll be playing hard to catch. Try to beat my top score of 13 seconds :p</p>\n<p>*Tip: Having trouble with the two full size linebacker bears knocking you into the abyss?\u00a0 One of them happens to be deadly allergic to the hay inside of rabbit poop.</p>\n<p>*Tip:If you fail, them bears will do a victory dance.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>I made this game by myself, which is the reason it's only one stage. It's my first attempt at a GameJam and it's not perfect. It's definitely going to be glitchy and stuff, but I\u00a0hope you enjoy it.\u00a0 I couldn't have done it without a few assets from the Unity Asset Store and the Tutorials from Unity. They really helped me along way.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfafb4fa3b5099c21673cab3951e2dec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jmendz999"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
