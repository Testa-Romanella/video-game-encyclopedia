Logged 20th Sept. 1921:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There is surely only one man in the world who could get me to drop everything and fly halfway around the globe at a moments notice. Frederik S. Carble. An investigator in matters of the occult. A Maverick, and an oddball. Just like me. Well, the last bit anyway.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Carble and I felt we were so close to something big, back in Arkham. He wanted to prove that we were not alone, that there was other intelligent life out there. I was just his helper really. Well at first. But more and more he let me in.\u00a0 Up until a few months ago I\u2019d say we had become partners.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Then suddenly, he ghosted me. Went off grid, stopped answering calls. Then I got a telegram from him a few months ago saying something about how I might be in great danger because of him. Then nothing, until this letter. He said he needed my help. And that he had found what he was looking for, but that the world was in a terrible danger.\r\n</p>\n<p>So, here I am, travelling to god knows where on this god forsaken filthy train. See, I told you I was an oddball.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T17:53:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b6/7b6b7e6f257e2aa71e6ddcd84880b19d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["J Bizzel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
