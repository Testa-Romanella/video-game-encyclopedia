To save a sinless soul or to snatch a shrine from the clutches of demons. The halo here, losing its connection with the sky, often goes out, but a good prayer returns the light again. There will be no help, you are alone with the demons.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAngels Prayer is a horror filled with dark personalities and terrible demons who constantly strive to catch you. Explore all the rooms and return the shrines of heaven. Remember, in this place only prayers light your halo and old greasy candles. Avoid the demons and complete the ultimate mission.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures of the game:<br/>\r\n- Tense Atmosphere<br/>\r\n- Pixel-Art<br/>\r\n- Atmospheric Music", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T03:23:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb8/fb84f17ac625f744da1ce313afa1826f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HotFoodGames"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["HotFoodGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
