Calvino Noir is the exploratory, sneaking adventure through the 1930s European criminal underworld. Architecture meets Noir as you become unwillingly entangled in a revolutionist plot. Sneak through sewers, across rooftops, and past guards in this dark and mysterious journey. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay as a disparate group of low-lifes, loners and last-chancers as they fight for the future of a city sliding slowly into the gutter. The characters of Calvino Noir exist in a moral universe which knows only shades of grey. Some are broken souls, some are merely damaged - but all are fighting to forge a future in an ugly world ruled by those whose hearts are cruel and dark.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlthough inspired by the futuristic dystopian visions of Deus Ex and Blade Runner, Calvino Noir is a throwback to an era that could easily be from Earth's past. The game is heavily noir influenced, but at the same time progressive, reflecting a somewhat modernist take on the classic genre.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCalvino Noir:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Seven levels splits across three acts<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Fully voiced rich and immersive narrative<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Stunning visual style inspired by classic film noir cinema<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Explore a richly detailed and atmospheric world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Co-ordinate multiple unique characters with a range of skills<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Use stealth or brute force to face those that stand in your way.", "metacritic": 55, "released": "2015-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T19:41:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/707/707bbe89e22074996f2da61bf96e33b8.jpeg", "website": "http://calvinonoir.com/", "rating": 3.31, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 179, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 74, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Calvino Noir"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Calvino Noir"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
