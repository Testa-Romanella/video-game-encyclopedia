Level 0 will teach you how to put your stardust in the blackhole. Level 1 will introduce storing stardust and crafting/upgrading towers. Level 2 is your first real test: a full stage with hazards to deal with. <em>If you fall off, you get respawned!</em>\u00a0Pressing the blue button in the bottom right starts a wave if possible. When a wave ends, another won't start until you press it (this will change to a short countdown starting after a wave is finished in future builds).

And if not, what aspects aren't? For example, enemies being too quick/slow, etc.<br/><br/>Is the balance between using stardust for towers and using it to feed the blackhole sufficient?</p>\n<p>Do you have any particular ideas for towers?</p>\n<p>What different terrain/level topography ideas do you think would be fun and interesting?<br/></p>\n<p>Does the flow of the game feel moderately\u00a0smooth, and in what ways if not?</p>\n<p>Is the UI intuitive and understandable? Any comments on adding/removing/clarifying anything\u00a0to it?<br/></p><p>There is currently no elemental effects/immunities implemented, so besides these, what kind of different behaviors might be interesting for enemies?</p><p>Did you find any interesting strategies during your gameplay? If so, please let us know what you found, and if not, tell us how we can give you more opportunity to strategize.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T17:39:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/074/074a1db3c6ca4cc205037a5b942565a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xenoxx17", "sharmanthony", "cfasil", "chartley1119"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
