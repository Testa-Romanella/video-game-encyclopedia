Now\u00a0the quantum computer virus has self generated to a point that it\u00a0is ready to escape into the rest of the world, to infect other quantum computers, and destroy the world!!! It's BIGGER!!!\u00a0It's BADDER!!! It's STRONGER!!! AND it's HARDER TO CONTROL than ever before!!!</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong>\u00a0pressing\u00a0spacebar pretty much does everything. Arrow keys to move the sight of view. Help the slimy quantum computer virus\u00a0get out by clinging on to the cooling fans, climbing all the way to the top, and leaking out through\u00a0of the top cover. <strong>play in full screen mode</strong>\u00a0after ehh... 15 mins? not sure, the virus gets the devs debug super powers unlocked, figure out the key. nope... it worked on superDev, not on dist no wait, i left the game on pause, returned at it worked. ...box2d glitch, dont pause or resize game while playing. if you do, restart from menu. the physics slow down and game cant be played. sorry but not my fault.</p>\n<p>Credits: most of this stuff is creative common license. ehh...\u00a0the music, well, people on spotify are already publishing it remixed as their original, but it's intro and funkybase from Radical Aces OST.\u00a0\u00a0800px-Vectra-xa-motherboard_hg.jpg (800\u00d7599)\u00a0Emoticon, Evil, Smile, Bad, Happy, Crazy | Green energy, Emoticon, Advantages of solar energy\u00a0... aight</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T07:38:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40d/40db93bfc899dff395670d70a81334b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maxkcyfun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
