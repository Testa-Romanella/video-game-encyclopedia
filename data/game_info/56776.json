The PC version uses CGA graphics.</p>\n<p>The game is played from the 3rd person perspective with a 3D view similar to Space Harrier. Gameplay involved controlling an aircraft called a skimmer to shoot down enemy towers. After destroying enough, the skimmer would drop down a skybike, which the player would use to destroy other enemy skybikers, while avoiding obstacles like trees. After destroying enough enemies, a boss character called a harvester would appear, which the player would have to defeat. Upon defeating the harvester the game awards the player with money, and loops back to the player controlling the skimmer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03d0bee4b1bcf631890a704ca54d4ae9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Cascade"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
