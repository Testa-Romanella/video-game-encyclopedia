If you get too close to the Sun you will be pulled by its gravity and burned. If you move too far, the gravitation will be too weak and you will move away from your pretty Sun and won't see it again, and you don't want that.\u00a0Touching the <strong>yellow orbit </strong>gives you\u00a0a so called\u00a0\"<strong>point</strong>\", but you have no idea what's the purpose of that thing.</p>\n<p>Anyway, you have strong feeling this won't end well and you won't be able to stay in the Sun's orbit for much longer.
