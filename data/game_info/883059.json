This casual restaurant management sim<br/>comes jam-packed with story, and you'll have a chance to both<br/>catch up with old friends and meet new faces.<br/><br/>Several years have passed since the events of the previous<br/>Hungry Hearts, and Grandma has just moved back into her<br/>old diner. Life's not all butterflies and apple pies though,<br/>and she has her work cut out for her getting the place back<br/>in tip-top shape. Running a diner by yourself isn't easy,<br/>especially when you've got bills to pay!<br/><br/>...Luckily, Granny here has some help!<br/>You, for one, but also hardworking Sue, her first ever hired hand.<br/>The girl's inexperienced, and she drops more dishes than she dries,<br/>but she's a lifesaver around the shop. Better yet, she's pleased<br/>as peaches to head out into town and run deliveries for you!<br/><br/>But enough of that\u2014you're not here to listen to an old woman<br/>ramble. So, what'll it be? A nice, simple bowl of rice? Or how about<br/>a pipin' hot beef croquette, fresh out of the fryer? This diner serves<br/>just about every classic Japanese dish you can find at your average<br/>local hash house, and the portions are generous to boot.<br/><br/>Stay a while, and Grandma's garrulous manner<br/>will soon have you as chatty as her other regulars.<br/>They're an odd bunch, and they all seem to have their<br/>share of troubles. But after the third bowl of miso soup or so,<br/>they'll open up and reveal their stories, both joyous and sad.<br/><br/>Strap in for an all new set of tales, with some surprising<br/>twists and turns along the way. And remember, everyone's<br/>got that one special meal they can just never forget.<br/><br/>----------------------------------<br/>\u3010Story\u3011<br/>----------------------------------<br/>On a tiny side street in a nameless little neighborhood sits an<br/>old Japanese diner. Things are quiet here; old-fashioned<br/>you might say. But of course they are. It's Showa era Japan,<br/>and the television is just starting to come into vogue.<br/><br/>Come on in, have a seat, and close your eyes.<br/>Thunk thunk goes the steady beat of a knife chopping<br/>veggies. Hisss; the sound of meat sizzling in a pan.<br/>Getting hungry? Good, 'cause the food here's sure to<br/>warm your belly and leave you feeling nice and full.<br/><br/>Besides, the kindly old granny who runs the place needs<br/>all the business she can get. She just opened the diner's<br/>doors the other day, and she's busy as a bee trying to stay<br/>afloat. Managing a successful eatery's no easy task when<br/>you're all by your loneso\u2014huh?<br/><br/>Wait a sec, who's that helping her out in the kitchen?<br/><br/>Welcome to Hungry Hearts Diner!<br/>It's a cozy place, a place where regular folk gather 'round<br/>worn wooden tables for a bite\u2014and maybe some friendly<br/>conversation, too. Here, you'll find food to fill your belly<br/>and stories that'll warm your heart.<br/><br/>Thanks for coming, and we hope you enjoy your meal!<br/>----------------------------------<br/>So, let me guess.
