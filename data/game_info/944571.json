For starters, there is no score being kept between the rounds, and no high score. Additionally, there are often issues related to hopping onto turtles or logs, where it may register Frogger as being on the water instead, causing you to lose your life. Additionally, there are no flies, no partner frog, no death animation, no sound, and no levels past the first one\u00a0within this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I was only able to successfully build this project for windows. I would have liked to at least have a WebGL build to show in Itch, but this project is old and buggy so I do not plan to restructuring the whole thing just to show to potential employers. I'd rather showcase my mistakes so that later, when I may add more games in the future, I can show how much I\u00a0have learned.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T11:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/56196a043803f8eb0b8c430ba58dfc87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vogtand1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
