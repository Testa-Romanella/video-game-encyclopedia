I know it's your first time after-hours but I know you'll do alright. Make sure to turn the lights back on after they flicker out in order to keep away those pesky bats. Rats with wings, let me tell ya.\u00a0If the bats stay at the lampposts for too long, well,\u00a0they'll mess with the electrical system... permanently. We don't want that. Don't forget!!<br/>See ya tomorrow,\u00a0<br/>Gordon\r\n\n<p><em>Use WASD to move and E to turn on lamps.
