{"id": 53207, "slug": "comix-zone-1995", "name": "Comix Zone", "name_original": "Comix Zone", "description": "<p>Comix Zone is a 1995 beat &#39;em up video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. An unusual feature of the game is that it is set within the panels of a comic book with dialogue rendered within talk bubbles and sprites and backgrounds possessing the bright colours and dynamic drawing style favoured by superhero comics. This style had been used in video games previously, for example Ocean Software&#39;s Batman: The Caped Crusader in 1988, but Comix Zone stretched the idea to such an extent that Sega applied for and were granted a patent for a &quot;Videogame system for creating a simulated comic book game&quot;.<br />\nThe concept for the game originated from a Commodore Amiga demo video animated by Peter Morawiec titled &quot;Joe Pencil Trapped In The Comix Zone&quot;. The video was made in 1992, displaying the animation of how the gameplay and the comic book elements would blend in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T01:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/da7/da77171112e11fbc2ad2114186bcd2bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 400, "beaten": 190, "toplay": 31, "dropped": 124, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 261, "suggestions_count": 457, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 266, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "iOS", "PC", "Xbox 360", "Android", "Game Boy Advance", "Genesis", "SEGA Master System", "Wii"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Sonic Team", "Backbone Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
