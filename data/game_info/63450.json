The virtual arcade is complete with realistic physics and a ticket redemption area to claim the prizes. Run out of money? Thats ok. The arcade owner has a shady brother that runs and illegal bootleg toy company and will buy your \"slightly used\" prizes for cash. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The market is always changing on what Barry \"The Dealer\" might want... So be sure to hold on to some items until he is willing to pay big money for them.
