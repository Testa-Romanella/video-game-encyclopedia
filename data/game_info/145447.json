Pikki must choose what to accept, and what to reject. Will Pikki be able to adapt?</p><p>A short game made for Ludum Dare 34, with the themes \"Two Buttons\" and \"Growth.\" I drastically overscoped this one, and as a result Pikki will likely never see the surface, but I'm pleased with what I was able to achieve in the time limit. This is the first time I've been able to add music to my game, so feel free to mute that with the \"M\" button at any time.</p><p>Controls: The entire game can be controlled with the mouse.<br/>Alternatively, you can use left and right, or \"Z\" and \"X\" to select buttons.<br/>\"M\" mutes the game.<br/>There's said to be a secret, forbidden button that can be found by true explorers... Those who are in a hurry can use \"~\" Whatever that means!</p><p>What will your Pikki become?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/328ca3f4317d1c6dfd2608297a99e1aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RockhopperGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
