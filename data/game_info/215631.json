You have to look for the key to open the door leading out of this place. But you are not alone. Monsters are lurking everywhere. Brace yourself for a fight!</p>\n<p>Conclusion: Following Brenda Romeros \"Challenges for game designers\" book there was a note \"look how MMO'x do the exploration\". Well I thought they usually send you to some land full of monsters to look for 10 rabbit pelts. Also after doing the Unity Roguelike tutorial and Lynda.com Advance UI and Battle system for 2d rpg courses I thought:\u00a0Why not to use what I have already learned?\u00a0All in all I am pretty happy with the result (much happier than from the week#1 game), but at the same time I feel like I gave way too much thought to the coding and not enough to the game design.</p>\n<p>What went good: I have learned to reuse what I already have (assets from tutorials) so I have gained some more time to look into some sounds for the game. The game is looking/working much better than the week#1 one.</p>\n<p>What went bad: As beneficial it is to reuse what you already have I feel like I overdid this prototype and instead of focusing on the design what I did was focused on programming and the code. I must look to not make the same mistake next time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b8f365e20230130b9db240606e6edaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunny Valley Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
