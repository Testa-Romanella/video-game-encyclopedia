You can make yourself large enough to step over a giant cliff, or make a key small enough to be passed through a solid wall. The game explores the consequences of this rescaling mechanic through simple yet difficult puzzles.<br/><br/><br/>A level where you have to stretch yourself in order to reach a star.<br/><br/>Skala takes place in a graphically simple world with a big house and a star filled sky to explore. The world is covered by a relaxing soundtrack which let's you take in all of the games mechanics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are over 90 puzzle levels to play through. Every level is unique and has some purpose, whether it's  introducing a new idea/mechanic, or developing on the concepts of previous levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T05:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/7806b478c5965bd6cd2507d93ed4015a.jpg", "website": "http://gustavalmstrom-site.herokuapp.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Gustav Almstr\u00f6m"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Gustav Almstr\u00f6m"], "esrb_rating": null}
