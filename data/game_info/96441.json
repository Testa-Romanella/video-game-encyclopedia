I'll be updating it over the next week or so with an actual metagame, cause it's too interesting to waste in it's current state!<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play?\r\n<p>Arrows to move, X to attack, and C to unlock doors if you have the key. R to regenerate the level.<br/></p>\r\nIssues:\r\n<ul><li>If the game doesn't respond to key presses, try clicking into the game \"window\" before pressing keys.</li>\n<li>If the game doesn't run at all, you likely either need a better browser (try firefox or chrome for best compatibility), or to enable javascript.</li>\n<li>If you continue to have issues and you want to help me fix it, please open the developer tools (hit f12) and send me any logs from the console.</li>\n<li>No sound on Safari: take it up with Apple, Vorbis is free/open.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c5/6c5581416e1c2c2af0b44368358da143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Max Cahill"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
