Recourse gathering, weapons, crafting - all of that you can see in this game.</p>\n<p>Our protagonist is travelling between mini planets, which are fully destructible. You can gather resources from their soil, with which later in the game you are able to make enhanced instruments or significant upgrades for your equipment. When you start a new game, a timer will be activated, which will enumerate how much time you survived in this desolate world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our team would be happy to hear any constructive criticism and feedback. We wish you a good game!</p>\n<p>Music - Kevin Mac Leod.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3ed652bfd460000fe0aa242161ab387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CB incorporation"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
