So please read this carefully\r\n<p>-<strong>WASD</strong> is for <strong>Movement</strong></p>\n<p>-<strong>Space Key</strong> to <strong>Jump</strong></p>\n<p>-<strong>Left Click</strong> to <strong>Attack</strong></p>\n<p>-<strong>Right Click</strong> to <strong>Dash </strong>(Direction depends on which <strong>WASD</strong> key you are holding)\u00a0</p>\r\nNow it gets confusing\r\n<p>-<strong><em>Hold </em></strong>the <strong>E</strong> key to <strong>Forecast </strong>(Remember <strong>HOLD </strong>the key) (Explained more below)</p>\r\nSo what do you do in the game?\r\n<p>Well in the game you fight <strong>endless </strong>waves of ninjas who throw<strong> ninja stars</strong> at you.\u00a0 However these ninjas will vanish and appear only for a short while to throw the ninja stars at you. It sounds <strong>difficult</strong> right?</p>\n<p>Well no not really. Ninjas <strong>can still be hit even when vanished</strong> so you may get lucky and slash one of them even <strong>after</strong> they vanish. Furthermore you have the <strong>Forecast\u00a0</strong>ability.</p>\n<p>This ability is activated when you <strong>hold E</strong>. Upon activation the screen <strong>turns reddish </strong>and you cannot move. You are <strong>still able to look around</strong> you and <strong>observe</strong> the enemies' movement/attack pattern. You will <strong>not take damage</strong> during this time. Once you release E, you will<strong> return to the point in time\u00a0</strong>that you started your Forecast. And although <strong>not 100 percent accurate</strong>, the movement and attacks of your enemies will be similar to those you have seen in the Forecast. With this ability you can<strong> predict </strong>where and when they will <strong>reappear</strong> and <strong>strike</strong> them.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashing </strong>also lets you <strong>phase </strong>through the ninja stars and <strong>avoid </strong>them <strong>without taking damage.</strong></p>\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for?\r\n<p>Now you know how to play.\u00a0Go and download the game now!
