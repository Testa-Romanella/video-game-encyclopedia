Drag it and create a new path that never existed before!<br/>Even a small change in the area you drag can create unexpected new paths. Find the optimal answer among many possible answers.<br/><br/>You must complete each stage by turning it around within a set number of times. Make good use of double jumps, 'reverse', etc. to clear the stage.<h3>New blocks</h3><br/><br/><br/>New blocks such as springs, lasers, etc. appear in each chapter.
