Each level-up earns you some points to spend on upgrades: more health, firepower, new weapons, skills, etc. Also it's made of voxels, so you can destroy walls and dig tunnels or trenches to hide from enemy fire, and blast holes in huge bosses to get to the vulnerable spots inside them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:00:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f64/f645f10f99e648e5cf1d31035521ae75.jpg", "website": "http://ranmantaru.com/games/level-up", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Ranmantaru Games", "Ape Apps"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ranmantaru Games", "Brandon Stecklein"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
