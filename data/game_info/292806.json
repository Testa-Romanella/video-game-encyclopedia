Each option mimics the experience of\u00a0three unique\u00a0women in STEM working at the University of California,\u00a0Santa Cruz. It is a story about the struggles women face trying to break through the gender barrier, but it also touches upon the intersectionality of womanhood, ethnicity, and gender nonconformity. We want to encourage young girls to pursue their passions despite the struggles they may face due to inequalities in the field, paving the way for future generations of women who will follow in their footsteps.</p>\n<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0- - - - - - - - - -</p>\n<p>This was an assignment for UCSC's CRWN 86 Fall 2018 course.
