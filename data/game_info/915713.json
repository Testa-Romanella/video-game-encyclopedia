You'll be challenged along the way to the treasures with puzzles tailored to these skills.\r\n</p>\n<p>The rules of the game are pretty simple. Walk left, right, up, or down, or do the one thing your hero does. One hit kills you, but once dead you keep playing as a ghost. Ghosts can be healed by picking up a heart left by a dead monster, or by the Nurse, or by returning to the beginning.\r\n</p>\n<p>One screen at a time is visible. When all players have left the screen, play moves on. Most screens contain a distinct puzzle.\r\n</p>\n<p>With one player it's fun, and with multiple players it's a riot!\r\n</p>\n<p>Please note this is not an on-line enabled game.\u00a0 All players must be local.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T10:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/021e71aded94a44a09aab172a637cfb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["andrewsommerville"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
