Click here.<br/>\n<em>*6+ Players Recommended</em></p>\r\nWelcome to TTT.io!\r\n<p>\r\nTrouble in Terrorist Town, or TTT for short, is similar to murder mystery whereby you must identify the traitor who is terrorising the town and kill them! Among the town, you have Detectives with special items to help the innocents survive. However, the Detective does not know who the innocents or traitors are! Traitors must secretly, or not, kill all the remaining innocents of the town within the time limit with help from other fellow traitors. Traitors also have special items to buy.\u00a0The goal is to survive, can you?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controls</strong><br/>\n<strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>Arrow</strong> keys to move<br/>\n<strong>Left Click</strong> to use item<br/>\n<strong>12345</strong> to select item and <strong>Q</strong> to drop item<br/><strong>SPACE</strong> to dash or spectate another player<br/>\n<strong>B</strong> to open shop<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong></p>\n<p>\r\nMake use of the traitor tester to help identify the traitors! Traitors and Detectives can buy special items in the shop with credits. Some items are unique to each role, so you will know who the traitors are if you see them holding those items. However, innocents can also pickup those items from dead traitors!\r\n</p>\n<p>More IO games<br/>More games by SirHandsomeJack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/571/571274bfef9b3820c8fecaa945164c2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SirHandsomeJack"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
