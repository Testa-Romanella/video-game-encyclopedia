With the discontinuation of Flash, the game has become harder to find (It is in the FlashPoint project).\u00a0I decided to try and recreate this game as a way to help me learn Game Maker. I am planning on remaking part 2. If you find any bugs please add a comment about it. (This is a fan remake. I did not make any of the assets. The game may trigger a false positive by an anti-virus.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T10:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b7/4b7e72d36c872a3394bb3cc8beaaf4e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linkpro4"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
