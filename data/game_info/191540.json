{"id": 191540, "slug": "video-games-i", "name": "Video Games I", "name_original": "Video Games I", "description": "<p>Play 3 classic games simultaneously on one computer with one Controller. 3 games<br/></p>\n<p>(Pacman, Pong, and Space-Invaders) are played at the same time. The games each take up a full screen, and are in either red, green, or blue. When two colours (games) overlap, the colours are mixed to generate the resulting colour, so it looks like all 3 games are translucent. It is possible to play all 3 games at once with one controller, but you can also disable the graphics of the games, as well as adjust their brightness.</p>\n<p>Currently, only an Atari ST version and a DOS version are available. The Atari ST version can be played with an emulator, and the DOS version can be played with DOSBox.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e49/e49ca9b7c9412128c0de79a124d7a3a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wacko Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
