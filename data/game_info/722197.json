You look behind you and see a music box playing a tune from your childhood. Was this all made for me? Did I do something? No time to ponder, you think to yourself and look behind the music box you see a light door. You try the knob, but it was locked. So now, it's time to find a key and get out of here.</p>\n<p>This game was made in three days just for fun. Even though this is the final build for the game, the collision system might need a little work, but hey, it works for now. If you want more games like this with a top-down scroller environment, then give me some ideas for my next game!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This game was made back in November of 2020 and was originally posted on Gamejolt. I decided to upload it here as an archive, cause why not :P\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T09:00:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4e/b4efd84932dd2bf327e423b5ca6ef7be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Your_Buddy_Jay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
