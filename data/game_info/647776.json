Rachel, who has been a good person all her life, suddenly finds herself on the seventh floor of hell, despite being sentenced to heaven. Rachel's only goal now is to cross all seven levels of hell one by one to get out of here and enter the heaven she deserves. However, this journey will not be that easy.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The white-bearded, old character seen in the first and last parts of the game is definitely not intended to portray God.
