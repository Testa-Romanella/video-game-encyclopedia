No timer as well.</p>\n<p>The main premise is that you have 60 seconds, or \"One Minute\", to beat the level, whist dodging things such as lava pits and enemies (enemies still in progress, as I said).</p>\n<p>I'm still working on resolutions so it has the main Unity resolution currently.</p>\n<p>I wanted this to be more of a speedrunning game, for people to speedrun, but since this is my first game, I am not sure if it is THAT.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T06:48:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f0/4f0d0df7988c7ccc7b9c99fd30ff06c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chaseygile"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
