Be on the lookout for super duper rare foods, because they are cool. <br/><br/>You are a fat king who needs to eat fattening foods to show his dominance. Little creatures called meeps are bringing you plenty of offerings, but be careful, because they are stupid and don't know what you human types eat. <br/><br/>Fatty foods like pizza and cake will make you grow. Healthy foods like celery and carrots will make you less fat. Poisonous foods like mushrooms will probably kill you. <br/><br/>A game by Clark Chambers and Ryan Kline <br/>with Music by Tyler Montgomery <br/>Made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 34<br/><br/></p>#18Fun(Jam)4.16#19Humor(Jam)4.21#66Audio(Jam)4.00#109Overall(Jam)3.84#118Mood(Jam)3.83#199Innovation(Jam)3.59#225Theme(Jam)4.00#346Graphics(Jam)3.74#1679Coolness41%<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/67540ea72156580cf3b31499a5db6eb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Kline"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
