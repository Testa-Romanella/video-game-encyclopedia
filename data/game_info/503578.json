The ships come in waves. If you<br/>manage to take care of five waves and nobody escapes, we will<br/>consider you worthy for this position and you'll get the rank of<br/>Lizard General. If you fail, we'll have to get rid of you.</p>\n<p>It is of uttermost importance to jam all signals of passing ships,<br/>so you will have to build a Jammer. This should be your first action.<br/>Keep it up to date, or you will fail!<br/>Then build defenses to pull the ships into the vortex.</p>\n<p>We're counting on you.</p>\n<p>Longe live the Order!<br/>Donald Dumb</p>\n<p>EDIT: The Jammer must be upgraded before every new wave (Jammer lvl 2 for wave 2 and so on), make sure to do that, otherwise you will lose.
