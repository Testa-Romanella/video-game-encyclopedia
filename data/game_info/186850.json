The objective in each game is stated near the window top, but usually involves moving a large block to a specified location within the window. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The DirtyDozen family is similar except there are L-shaped puzzle pieces.</p>\n<p>The Traffic-Rush family uses data, with 2x1, 1x2, 3x1, 1x3 rectangles. Here, the long rectangles represent cars or trucks that can only move [roll] lengthwise...the goal being to move the red car toward the \"exit door\".</p>\n<p>Note that a game description files are simple text files that allows users to define additional puzzles.</p>\n<p>Several other classic block slider games are included:\u00a0 Fifteen, Eight, Nine, Panama, MaBoy, GetMyGoat, 2-versions of HoleInOne, Suits, and 2-versions of LinkRings. \u00a0</p>\n<p>To move a block, use the arrow keys. If the automatic block selector chooses the wrong block, simply click the cursor on the desired block before using the arrow key. Thusly, the games are laptop friendly.</p>\n<p>Finally, there are autosolvers embedded into the TrafficRush, Klotski, DirtyDozen, LinkRings, Maboy and GetMyGoat games to be used interactively, using the (=)-key.\u00a0 This provides an amazing tool to learn to solve seemingly hopeless problems.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac77a4601fc20b16dcf7ab9514c5570.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["fastrgv"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
