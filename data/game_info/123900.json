{"id": 123900, "slug": "maze-light", "name": "Maze Light", "name_original": "Maze Light", "description": "<p>Maze Light is a small 2-week school project by 3 game design students from the LUCA School Of Arts in Genk, Belgium. The project consists of building a demo game from scratch, centered around a single mechanic, maintaining a maximum of 2 player-controlled procedures. Using strict technical and artistical constraints within the project, the team tries to showcase their individual skill sets as well as teamworking capabilities within the given project time limit of 2 weeks.</p><p>In the game, you play as a light dropped within the Dark Maze, but you're losing brightness rapidly. Scattered throughout the Maze are other Light Sources that will share their brightness with you. The player needs to find the exit while trying to avoid the light from going out. However, the Dark Maze might not be what it seems at first glance...</p><p>Please keep in mind this is only a 2-week project and the team is not planning to continue develoment of the final prototype after the time limit has been met, therefor our Work-In-Progress builds throughout this 2-week period will be free to download for everyone. Either way we hope you enjoy and your feedback is always appreciated!</p><p>- Team Maze Light</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7a/c7a2fd49f3511d69e796467c9c9a4c5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EvilToiletGuy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
