It was funded through Kickstarter.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>On an art exhibition in a modern-day Paris, a criminal disguised as a pizza boy shoots the art galleries owner and steals the painting that was captured by fascists in Catalonia in 1937. George and Nico accidentally meet each other and begin the investigation of this event.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Broken Sword 5: The Serpent&#39;s Curse is a 2-dimensional game that is, unexpectedly, features a third-person camera. Like in the previous titles of the series, the game still relies on its point and click user interface. In order to bring something new into the gameplay, Revolution Software added crafting into the game. Crafting allows creating new items that are essential to progress further into the game&#39;s levels. </p>\n<p>Like in the previous game, Broken Sword 5: The Serpent&#39;s Curse relies on its hotspot system. There are special spots scattered across the levels. When the players stand right on them, several actions will become available for them.</p>\n<p>Character death scenes are back again. It is possible to die if the players react too slow on something or make a wrong decision. The players do not start off the last checkpoint after death. Instead, the players spawn right before their death scene.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T13:02:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/dd2/dd2959a5d4ef08ca3ba887945a117334.jpg", "website": "https://revolution.co.uk/games/the-serpents-curse/", "rating": 3.56, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 99, "owned": 1102, "beaten": 78, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 13, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 59, "ratings_count": 101, "suggestions_count": 504, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 101, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Revolution Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Revolution Software", "Revolution"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
