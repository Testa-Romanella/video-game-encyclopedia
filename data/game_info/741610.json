He quickly meets up with a man and a woman who are also trapped inside the maze, and together they try to solve the mysteries surrounding why they ended up there, who brought them here, and how they can escape.</p>\n<p>However, they soon realize that escaping the maze isn&#39;t going to be as easy as simply looking around for an exit. They are barraged by strange puzzles, writings left behind that seem to raise more questions about their predicament than answers, and, last but certainly not least, a nightmarish monster that very much wants our protagonist dead.</p>\n<p>The game is fast paced, with a tense atmosphere and a story that turns out to be less predictable than it may appear at first.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-15T15:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d3/2d336de898f778bcf5e2dd66dbefd556.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/11574/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gustav"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Gustav"], "esrb_rating": null}
