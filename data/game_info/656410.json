Running around trying to avoid getting shot as you pick up more and more guns that enemies have a chance of dropping. You know carrying all these guns seems kind of useless if you're not going to use them, how about you change that. As the more guns you pick up you'll immediately use it, firing alongside your other guns.</p>\n<p>This project was my first time taking part in a game jam, while I handled only the design, player controls and shooting, I was lucky enough to have an incredible partner who picked up my slack and handled everything else, Salma. Together we made this game and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as it was making it!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p><p>Assault Rifle by Zsky on poly pizza -\u00a0https://poly.pizza/m/XGeBGFQxYg<br/>Starfield Skybox by PULSAR BYTES on unity asset store -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/starfield-skybox...<br/>Sci-Fi Gun Light by Factory of Models\u00a0on unity asset store -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/sci-fi-gun-light-87916<br/>Starter Assets - Third Person Character Controller by Unity Technologies on unity asset store -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-cha...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T22:31:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5d/a5d78bfcd9d0585bca7dfd018263435e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PaRK66", "salmashnur"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
