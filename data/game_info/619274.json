For example, more running stickmen will cause your group to run faster but more stickmen in the group would slow you down. More jumping stickmen means that you'll jump higher, but the more stickmen in your group, the heavier the group becomes.</p>\n\n<p>There are 12 levels, several with more than one solution. Good luck and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:06:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa5/aa5a140a735894addbeb41a907387988.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lullahan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
