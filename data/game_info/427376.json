This game will focus on new maps, excotic weapons, awesome visual effects. As per described in the last paragraph, this game will be online based and people can make their own group, or they can arrange a level of game among them. So that this game design will be pretty simple like different cities or any other area with few buildings and structure for shelter and firing. As my game main focus is earning a certain level of skill. So if players play in a team still they have to work from their level in a same play field like more skill users might use sniper rifle or shotgun. As there are lots of action games in the market, This fast-paced Casual game allows instant respawns and encourages rapid engagements. After spawning, players have a limited amount of time to select weapons of their choice and engage the enemy. throughout the match players will be given bonus points for achieving kills. Respawn immediately and get back to the fight! Each player can equip 4 weapons at the same time with the ability to change which types of weapons they want to equip when they are in a safe environment. Players can hold 2 one-handed weapons or 1 two-handed weapon at any given time, and switch among the 4 weapons that are currently equipped.</p>\n<p>Group Work Management : (GITHUB)</p>\n<p>https://github.com/amlannag6/MindOfAction-Combat</p>\n\n<p>User Interface:</p>\n<p>The user interface must be adaptive to fit many sizes of screens, and the UI elements must reflect the changes in character stats effects.</p>\n<ol><li>Window resizing - we will use Airtest to automate window resizing on the game client. The game passes the test if all the UI elements are correctly placed and sized on the screen when screen resolution is between 800<em>640 and 3240</em>2160.</li><li>Responsiveness - we will automate a series of attacks and special effects on a player character (the character will be healed to full HP after HP reaches 1) and observe the UI responding to these actions. AirTest will gradually increase the speed with which these actions are carried out and the system passes the test if all the registered actions are reflected on the UI when APM is under 500.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T07:22:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2d/d2d0b4f5d942319ddf975d05f26c8f13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["amlannag6"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
