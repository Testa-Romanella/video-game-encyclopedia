For now this game will be available to anyone who pre orders or supports that project.<br/></p><p>--This game is in early development, more features are to follow--</p><p>At first glance this game will look like your basic Flappy bird clone, but we have decided to release our game at this stage without all the cool features so that we can test the base mechanics. The game will feature unlocks, achievements, themes and much more.</p><p>We want to give a game like this purpose, by adding achievements that will unlock new playable characters, backgrounds and themes. We feel that this will give the game more purpose than just mindless clicking... now its mindless clicking with a purpose!  </p><p>-- Road Map --</p><p>In order of priority </p><p>-Music and sounds (10%)</p><p>-Save Function (0%)</p><p>-Space bar as well as mouse click (100%)</p><p>-On-line Leader boards (10%)</p><p>-Themes (10%)</p><p>-Unlocks (0%)</p><p>-Achievements (0%)</p><p>-In game adverts (0%)</p><p>-- For the Official Facebook page --</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/JustTapItOfficial/?skip_n...<br/></p><p>All updates will be posted here, so don't forget to give it a follow to know when the new updates are out.</p><p>--  In response to the negative publication we have received --</p><p>We understand that people will see this as a \"clone\" but we are trying to build upon the basic mechanics of Flappy Bird, and build something with more purpose for the player. We take criticism well and we are prepared for negative comments, although we don't really have anything to say to anyone who has negative comments (unless its constructive criticism that is useful, and not just negative \"slagging\" off)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26a/26a35da158e5378b3a86511870354add.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Etriverce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
