I created individual\u00a0levels 1, 2, and 3. Each level leads into the next.</p>\n<p>2. I added two powerups: a speed boost (green) and the other is a jump boost (purple). Both visual designs are based on the score pickup.</p>\n<p>3. I created two enemies: a speedy enemy based on the basic walker but moves at a much faster speed and is yellow, and a boss enemy based on the smart walker but has more health, is red, and is larger than the smart walker.</p>\n<p>Created by Soren Gerlach</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T12:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/910/910825b4c4325ba18a2210324d7210e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gerlac32"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
