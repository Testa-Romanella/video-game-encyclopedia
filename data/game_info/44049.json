Will you be the exception to the rule?<br/><br/><br/>\"...the asteroid hit the Earth in the end anyways, and fxxked everybody up.\"<br/><br/>\"So let's cut this short: An asteroid wiped out civilization as we know it. Some wasteland tramp discovered that the asteroid shards grant possessors unexplained powers; so they founded this cult, calling it the 'Scientific Church of Enlightenment' and this 'Church of Enlightenment' built the Ark and they built a whole city around it. It's gonna be where the restoration of humanity starts, they said. But just look around you; these streets are all empty, not a soul to be seen at all now.\"<br/><br/>\"Sounds worthy of your life to have a look... right?\"<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Procedurally-generated Dungeons - In the underground complex of The Ark, use the environment to your advantage as you fight against enemies in challenging scenarios that change every time you enter the game.<br/></li><li>Unlockable Weapons and Items - As you return to the starting camp after death, talk to the different merchant to purchase potent unlockables like new guns and other consumables to help you on your next journey.<br/></li><li>Difficulty and Hardcore Play - In the beginning you may die a lot, maybe even \"a lot\" a lot. Just give Enlightenment and yourself a bit more time and patience and everything's going to be alright.<br/></li><li>Smooth, Fast-paced Fighting Experience - As you get through the game, the fluidly-animated action and sense of accomplishment from overcoming what's thrown to you will provide a rewarding experience. Stay wary though, as there are a lot surprises!<br/></li><li>Weird, Post-Apocalyptic Story - In Enlightenment, you will obtain scattered information about the world constantly. These jigsaw pieces are hidden in item descriptions, the environment, and through NPC interactions which eventually form a \"Big Picture\" look about the end of the world and the society, culture, and religion that it left behind.</li></ul><br/>LizardKing is founded in 2015, we are 7 seasoned fervent gamers and work in a small city alongside Yangtze River, on top of the pursuit of perfection, we are also into both exploring the possibility of game-making.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd7/cd7b78d90e54d42ff0a2508f14a4cd21.jpg", "website": "http://coconut.is/enlightenment/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 15, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LizardKing"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coconut Island Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
