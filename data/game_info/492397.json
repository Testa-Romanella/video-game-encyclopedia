The game's current form is the end product of feature-creeping a sorta juicy platformer movement prototype thing I made -- hence, the (lack of) theming. It's my first somewhat-finished solo-developed game development project, so I'd really appreciate any feedback!<br/></p>\n<p>I'm planning on fixing bugs and tweaking content in this game probably through the end of the year. Since college has started up again, though, I'm releasing the current version with the intention of just getting something delivered before I get too overwhelmed with work. Hope it's at least somewhat entertaining in its current form!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:27:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/283/283780ff3803e1db16816e62755254e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lucien Eckert"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
