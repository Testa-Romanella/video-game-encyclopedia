The aliens have transformed them into mutants. Now your home country is infested with them.<br/><br/>Your mission objective is to destroy as many of those mutant creatures as you can by blasting rockets at them. One hit should destroy each enemy. Also the score varies during play. Each enemy has a different behaviour pattern, which is as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Bats: 100 points<br/></strong></p>\n<p>These purple mutant creatures stay airborne. However these little blighters drop green goobers, which is guaranteed to pierce through your tank and cause a major explosion. Be very careful</p>\n<p><strong>Fire bugs: 200 points<br/></strong></p>\n<p>These mutants stay airborne and run  slightly faster than the bats are, but they are also very lethal. They drop fire balls. You are doomed if you get hit by the fireballs.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire birds: 500 points<br/><br/></strong>These monsters do not shoot anything. However they are still very lethal. Fire Birds will attempt to charge into your tank once spotted on sight. These mutants are much more heavier than a small tank like yours.</p>\n<p>The more mutants you shoot, the more intense the game will get. How far can you get before you get totally smashed by the enemies? Can you beat your hi score?</p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Graphics and game design by <strong>MightyMechanic<br/></strong>Programming, development and music by <strong>Richard Bayliss</strong>Sound effects from Sound Effects Starter Pack by Simon13666</p>\n<p>Created and developed with Unity 2020.2f.6 and C# Scripting</p>\n<p><strong><em>(C)2021 The New Dimension as freeware.\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>Release notes:<br/></p>\n<p>V1.0: First release</p>\n<p>V1.1: Fixed music distortion and also loop the music.
