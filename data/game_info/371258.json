Am I dead?\r\nA VOICE: No, you're not dead but it's just like. You don't want to know the truth because your mental health depends on it. Trust me and you will regain your freedom.\r\nI : Who are you? What do you want from me ? Why should I trust you?\r\nA VOICE: Because you have no choice\r\n\r\n<p>You wake up in a futuristic room and you do not understand what you are doing here. Stun the different puzzles that will be presented to you for a chance to know the reasons for your confinement. Do not trust your kidnapper who has hidden traps in a parallel world and affects the world in which you operate. The walls may not be walls, the floor may be just a trap that will take you to your death. </p>\r\nTeam little world\r\n<p>We are so happy to present you our first game made by the VRAI Studio Team's. We are a small studio who try to developp some VR experience and this game jam was the opportunity to try something different. We did all by our own - 3D, Scripts, Sounds, UI (Icons and others) and all you can see.\u00a0We loved the theme and we try to do our best. Feel Free to download try the game and comment.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme</strong>\u00a0: The theme evoke the capacity of the game to disimulate the truth to the player because the game must be a challenge and a little lie is important if you want to hide something.</p>\r\nFuture\r\n<p>We couldn't finish the history's game but if the community like it, we will make more level, more features and write the end of history we are looking for.</p>\n<p>Features we didn't have time to implement or configure :<br/>- The number of teleport, walk and signs.<br/>- Menu discover features over the time.<br/>- Clear animation to look more realistic.</p>\n<p>We love our game and we hope you too. If you have some ideas, feel free to comment and share them with us.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T09:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e8/5e848d0fa106971dcb266ab9dcf313ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VRAI Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
