Soon, they'll be telling all their friends, family and social-media-followers about their experience, and the visitors will flock to us for a glimpse of <em>Nessiteras rhombopteryx</em>!</p>\n<p>Your job is to control this Nessie dummy we've put together, and to position it carefully such that the tourists can get a good view of it. You should be able to move it around using your arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we didn't have a very large budget, and consequently it's not a very convincing construction; please don't get too close, otherwise they'll notice it's a fake and we'll be ruined!</p>\n<p>Oh, and look out for submarines too -- no idea what they're doing in our Loch, but they're probably full of tourists too. </p>\n<p>Created in 48 hours of Ludum Dare: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=p...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a5/4a50355d5a3babec4424252b048e25cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeekAnarchism"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
