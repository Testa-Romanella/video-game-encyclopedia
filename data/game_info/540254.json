All he finds are the journals of Tlaloc, a hero that he had always admired that towered above all. From his slumber, he finds a sword, a talking raven, and must fight to survive the night, and unravel the mystery of why he's here.<br/></p>\n<p>Mythic Prelude is an action-adventure title inspired by Action-Adventure titles from the 90s. This demo is designed as a stand-alone freeware product for itch.io and for our Kickstarter!<br/><br/>Lead: Dmitri Lowell<br/>Music: The Noble Demon<br/>Promotional Artwork: Kazumi Takashi<br/>Tileset: Le Pixelists<br/>Boss and IntroRoom Tileset: Jason Perry<br/></p><p>(Remainder of credits on the Kickstarter page)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T03:44:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/9694720fe90d02c59d28ce6b767df5ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dmitri Lowell"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
