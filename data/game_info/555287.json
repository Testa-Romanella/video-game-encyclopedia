(C slash rogue) This is a small turn-based roguelike set in a procedurally generated dungeon, bog-standard. The twist? You can change the content! Don't like the default spritesheet? Make your own! Tired of the built in tiles? Design some for yourself! You can add tiles and switch out the spritesheet to your liking. There are instruction files included to help you out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other than this feature, the game is similar to any other of this type. Scourge the dungeon for chests and currency, evade monsters, and reach the exit. Collect enough chests to gain an artifact. Collect enough artifacts and you win.</p>\n<p>The \"discord\" version of the game has discord integration built in. Only tested on my system (windows 10), may not work for others. Use the default version if in doubt.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:56:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf61a8ec069f14956799e78bab598742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tobogganeer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
