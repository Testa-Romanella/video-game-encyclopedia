You, as a private detective, head to the abandoned house to investigate an unsolved case from ten years ago after receiving a mysterious letter. Locked closets, mysterious symbols, rustling radios, to find the scattered pieces around and uncover the secrets hidden behind the disappearing portraits. What kind of truth is waiting for you?<br/><br/><br/><br/>A wealthy businessman originally had a happy and harmonious family, living together with his wife and two daughters in a mansion. However, an unfortunate event occurred when the businessman was diagnosed with cancer. Despite seeking medical treatment everywhere, he was helpless and could only turn to the local cult organization. It was said that they had a medicine that could cure any illness. However, the so-called medicine was only incense containing hallucinogenic substances, which would make people feel as if they were cured. Due to their excessive use of hallucinogens, the businessman\u2019s wife went insane and committed suicide by hanging herself. The wealthy businessman himself became insane as a result.<br/><br/>At this point, the cult had already converted the mansion\u2019s basement into a psychedelic mushroom farm, preparing for a ritual sacrifice of live humans. They tempted the crazy businessman with eternal life as a condition for his willingness to be the sacrifice, and used the flesh and blood of his loved ones as part of the ceremony to summon Satan, whom they worshipped. In the end, the ritual \u201csucceeded,\u201d and everyone saw their own version of Satan.<br/><br/>Later, when the protagonist came to investigate the case and entered the mansion, there were still a lot of psychedelic gases due to the continuous propagation of the psychedelic mushrooms. Under the influence of the gas, the protagonist saw many incredible supernatural phenomena, including ghosts, undead, and even the wealthy businessman who had turned into a lump of flesh. The police who had come to investigate the case before became insane due to the large amount of psychedelic gas, so the case was eventually abandoned.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Real: first-person perspective, you will go back to the 1890s scenes of Britain, feel the pure British atmosphere<br/></li><li>Detective: As a private detective, you will explore the abandoned house, collect clues and discover the truth<br/></li><li>Decryption: The room is equipped with multiple clues and mysteries, and the final mystery is waiting for you to uncover<br/></li><li>Immersion: Explore the room and interact with various objects, as if in a real secret room to explore the case</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T02:50:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f63/f63d46fb8d84564c0448ca0affcb8661.jpg", "website": "https://vrsuplife.com/home", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Suplife Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Suplife Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
