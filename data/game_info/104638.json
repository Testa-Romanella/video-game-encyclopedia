Unfortunately, the portal they opened became stuck, and conquerors from a future doom have flooded into the wild west. Cowhands, Native Americans, and Technomancers all have aligned to try to fix the past before it becomes an alien technohell.</p>\n<p><strong>I learned Python and made this game at the same time</strong>. Created for Ludum\u00a0Dare 41. Missed the Compo deadline so I threw it in the Jam.</p>\n<p>Python's a neat language but I dunno about making games in it.</p>\n<p>Game might be crashy, the late game loot is maybe not finished.
