This specific game was difficult to do because it had multiple game states that the player could be in, and all of them had their own mechanics and behaviors, while also having strangely complex AI. The original game is also racist, so I wanted to make it not racist and cute by changing the sprites and thus changing the context. While I was working on the game, I came down with a bad head cold which developed into a sinus infection. So obviously I couldn't finish it.\u00a0What I mainly learned from this \u201cfailed\u201d attempt in cloning Banana is that my health needs to come before a game, and a failed prototype is only a failure if it wasn\u2019t made. Even a half-baked prototype can teach something.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T04:03:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50e/50e69ede8cf81d42e2b6e0e206470d1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John Wanamaker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
