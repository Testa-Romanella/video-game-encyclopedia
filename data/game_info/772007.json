Gobble up apples and grow larger...cool...but what if your snake was built of weapons of mass destruction?\u00a0And what if instead of eating apples, you at cities?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Destructopillar is a snake of a different kind.</strong> Writhe through cities and towns destroying buildings so you can grow and grow. Add weapons that you'll need to fend off the military attackers. How many cities can you destroy?</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Use <strong>left/right arrows </strong>to change direction</li><li>Use the <strong>action button</strong> to boost (boosting uses energy)</li></ul>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Destroy cities to build up your Destruct-o-meter. Once your meter is full, collect the fruit to add a new weapon to your length. Collect 3 of the same weapon in a row for a powerful upgrade. Avoid getting hit by enemy bullets. Taking a shot to the head will reduce hearts and segments only have so much health.</p>\n<p>Each city has a goal that you need to reach. Once reached, find your way to the exit and continue on your path of destruction.</p>\r\nWeapons &amp;\u00a0power-ups\r\n<ul><li><strong>Pear:</strong>\u00a0Gun, attacks ground and air targets</li><li><strong>Blueberry:\u00a0</strong>Laser, only attacks air targets</li><li><strong>Orange:\u00a0</strong>Flamethrower, only attack ground targets</li><li><strong>Cherry: </strong>Heals segments</li></ul>\r\nThanks\r\n<p>Big thanks to the entire PICO-8 community for their support and help while I was making this game.
