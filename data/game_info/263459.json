When playing a multiplayer\r\ngame meant you\u2019d have to share a keyboard? It's time for a revival!</p>\n<p>\r\nPlane\r\ncrazy takes things to a new level, making it possible for up to 7\r\nplayers to use a single keyboard in this retro arcade flight shooter\r\ngame. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer as you fly\r\naround and attempt to shoot down your rivals!</p>\n\n\n<p>\r\nTake\r\nto the skies and obliterate your enemies. Fly low through the city\r\nskyline, dodge skyscrapers and launch endless missiles across the\r\ncity. This game is an intense assault on the senses; it\u2019s up to you\r\nto make sense of the chaos around you and survive long enough to be\r\ncrowned the craziest plane of all.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The\r\nconcept</strong></p>\n<p>\r\nMy\r\nfond memories of gaming don't come from hearing how fat my mum is\r\nover a headset, head to head with another player, shooting virtual\r\nnobodies. They come from a much simpler time; a time where not only\r\ndid you have to be in the same house, but often share the same\r\ncontroller to have your multiplayer experience.</p>\n<p>\r\nI\r\ndecided to continue making games that no studio would be able to risk\r\ncreating, so in true indie developer style I had the idea to cram as\r\nmany people as possible onto a single keyboard. They say seven is a\r\nlucky number, so I chose seven players- why not?</p>\n<p>\r\nThe\r\nproblem is that keyboards suck quite a bit and their manufacturers\r\nhave been slow to recognise the need for optimal gaming\r\nfunctionality, so most keyboards struggle to register multiple key\r\npresses in a bid to get away with the bare minimum. This game is my\r\nprotest to this kind of behaviour- we demand better keyboards!</p>\n<p>\r\nKey\r\nRollover is the fancy term for this and different keyboards promise\r\ndifferent capabilities all the way up to supporting the fabled N-key\r\nRollover. If you have one of these, then this game is a must have.\r\nIt\u2019s time to fully utilise the keyboard to its full potential- here\r\nis your benchmark app!</p>\n<p>\r\nThe\r\nkey layout has been designed so that the keyboard can be rotated to\r\nallow for more room. For example, the green, yellow, and purple left\r\nand right controls are flipped so that the keyboard can be rotated\r\nand more people can access the keys.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Development\r\nand Tech</strong></p>\n<p>\r\nThis\r\ngame is the latest game developed using my own, from-scratch game\r\nengine which is called The Indie Game Engine. This latest release\r\nutilises more sophisticated rendering techniques and lighting, and\r\nshould get your processors going.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab5c0632990eb44ea4a975bc1b7a2f5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yesindiedee"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
