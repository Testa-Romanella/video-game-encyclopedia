I will give shout outs to the top scorers' social media accounts in the next massive devlog following the end of the competition. It's a nice incentive, especially for fellow game developers. Whenever you get a new high score, just take a screenshot and post a comment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, let us know if there are any bugs in the game (we know a few but didn't fix them because they aren't anything game breaking the most it'll just ruin that specific run at the beginning).</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Me and my friend have been working on this game for the past couple of months during our spare time. We are both highschoolers, but we want to make a game that others can enjoy. We started this project, thinking we can make a quick game in a single night. We ended up expanding our ideas to create the demo you see here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let us know how you like the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T13:51:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8fd50a21bfa2ecc0ac1083db4e62391.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["FutureInspireGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
