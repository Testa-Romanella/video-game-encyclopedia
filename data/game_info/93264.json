At the beginning of each round press the key you want to use to join in. After everybody is ready you'll have 30 seconds to draw something (it's up to you to collaborate or not).<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>// NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>Once the time is up, the painting will be framed, named and displayed in your art gallery. If you play several rounds in a row you'll see your art gallery slowly filling up (it'd be great to have this game running at some event *wink* *wink*).</p>\n<p>After each round the game will enter \"screensaver mode\" (until you choose to start a new work of art).</p>\n<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>You can toggle fullscreen pressing \"M\".<br/></em></li><li><em>It's not about winning or losing, just having a laugh and filling your gallery.<br/></em></li><li><em>Sound and music might take longer to load on the web version.</em></li><li><em>It's not common but sometimes the browser version doesn't get keyboard input, refresh or minimize the window to fix this.</em></li><li><em>Some keyboards have restrictions regarding how many keys you can press at the same time (specially laptops).<br/></em></li><li><em>The mac version hasn't been tested and might not work at all.</em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Violin Concerto in E major, RV 269 'Spring' - I.
