As stated before, the only way you can do this is to use Sol's seemingly unnatural power to control the environment through changing the four seasons; Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.<br/><br/>This is indeed a demo version, this game is still a work in progress and will have more content released in the future. At the moment you can only play with a PS4 Controller for this game. There are Keyboard commands also but those are just to make sure the game works.<br/></p><p>This version was made as my thesis project for my graduate program at LIU Post for Game Design.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba1/ba1ebd2ec2b3f396e06003cd603fb81b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gerard Gilmartin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
