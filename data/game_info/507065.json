Once the bee is perched, release the stick for a few seconds to let the bee extract that sweet pollen, once the flower spins out of pure joy, go to the next flower. But be careful, stay away from dangers lurking around, or you might drop pollen (the queen wouldn't be too happy about it).</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>For the font, we used a free resource on the web.<br/>Baloo font, an affable display typeface by Ek Type<br/>https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/baloo</p>\n<p>All sounds used come from www.freesound.org , a non-profit community website that has free sounds and an attribution license (CC Creative Commons).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:29:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4eb8ef31a830c131731966211b8ae192.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["CaSaTa_Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
