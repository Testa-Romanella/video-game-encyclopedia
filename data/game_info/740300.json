But before you can investigate (ie. talk to a handful of NPCs and get a long-winded mission assignment from someone in charge) you must first escape from your guild hall!</p>\n<p>Fight lonely old men, various monsters, and some boss monsters that are pretty big in this epic adventure!</p>\n<p>But wait, there's more!</p>\n<p>If you order (we mean download) now (and into the future) you get:</p>\n<ul><li>The ability to customize all your items and gear! (Dual wield Greatswords? How about a magical wand that triples your experience? Maybe a healing item that also buffs every stat for 100 turns?!)\r\n</li><li>Change Classes at will!\r\n</li><li>Unlock different Classes!\r\n</li><li>Use a class as a Sub-class!\r\n</li><li>And even\u00a0<strong>more</strong>\u00a0Class line items to make this list look huge!\r\n</li><li>A fully customized battle system that uses combos, happens on-screen, features 3 characters at once, and even uses animations that are only mostly ripped off from the default Ace animations?!\r\n</li><li>A lengthy adventure that is as long as you want! (If you want it to be 80 hours, just leave it running on your computer for several days!)\r\n</li><li>Collectors set of figurines (Disclaimer: No, you actually don't, this is a complete lie!)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>Project History and Continuation</strong></em></p>\n<p>This was an entry created in 2 weeks! (Yes, all art and scripts and resources were done in 2 weeks! Except for like the tilesets and icons, which is in the credits section, we didn't even make those and both would take us way more than 2 weeks!)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Meet the Cast</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Blanc</strong></p>\n<p>Our main heroine. I don't know why she is dancing backwards or who she is going to punch by going in that direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Name</strong>: Is the name of a pudding... like everyone else!</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon of Choice</strong>: Depends on her current class!</p>\n<p><strong>Likes</strong>: Her own table-top RPG game she's making</p>\n<p><strong>Dislikes</strong>: Having to go through combat refresher courses</p>\n<p>Blanc is a recently appointed mercenary in the nameless guild of Boudin. She is excited that the castle has called for her services on some important mission. Maybe it will change her life?</p>\n<p><strong>Junket</strong></p>\n<p>I claim this rock in the name of loin-cloth!<br/><br/><strong>Name</strong>: Surprisingly, it's the name of a pudding.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon of Choice</strong>: Depends on his current class!</p>\n<p><strong>Likes</strong>: Manly stuff. Being a jerkhole. Women.</p>\n<p><strong>Dislikes</strong>: Thinking and monsters that are 'bigger' than him.</p>\n<p>Junket is a mercenary of some renown. I'm not sure how much, but it is definitely quantifiable as 'some.' He's nicer when you get to know him, which basically means he's a jerkhole but you get used to it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Ashure</strong><br/></p>\n<p>What? Where's the cleavage? I thought female armor only covered...<br/><br/><strong>Name</strong>: Okay, this is totally weird, but like everyone else in the game, it's a type of pudding! What a coincidence!</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon of Choice</strong>: A sword! (No, actually it's based on her class, gotcha!)</p>\n<p><strong>Likes</strong>: Money, money, and sometimes men (with lots of money that will die soon.)</p>\n<p><strong>Dislikes</strong>: Not having money. Men that want something in return for money. Men she could marry for money that want more from her than her having their money.</p>\n<p>Ashure is a lady who likes money and fancy stuff. If it doesn't turn a profit, it doesn't turn her head. Overall she's really not a very nice person, but she kinda acts nice because it makes her look fancy. And fancy looks like money. I think you're starting to get the connection.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\"Are you serious? I am getting paid for being here, right?\"<br/><br/><em><strong>Credits</strong></em><br/><br/>1.
