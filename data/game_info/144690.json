Not letting this stop me, I spent countless hours watching tutorials and over time learned Java. I watched many more tutorials that helped me build a working rudimentary game engine. From there I used my imagination and Stack Overflow to add features to my game until it became a full product. I recruited an artistic friend of mine to create all the assets for the game and eventually Goblin Gauntlet was the result.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e8/7e8a458b8ddb56b833aaa1b4ff456a92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dokenfuss"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
