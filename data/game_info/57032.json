During the release of this video game, other Formula One video games like Super Monaco GP had caused a general increase of demand for Formula One video games. While most of those games were poor simulations of the races, Fastest One proved to be the most realistic of the era.</p>\n<p>The game was based on Formula One racing and featured team and driver names similar to the real life namesakes. A choice of up to 18 playable vehicles could be used in every mode provided. Six vehicles in the game used Ford engines, displaying American ingenuity during the 1990 Formula One season. The language of the game was English.</p>\n<p>Most of the Formula One drivers who participated in the 1990 Formula One season were represented, with slightly altered names (e.g., Satoru Nakajima made an appearance as \"S. Inakajima\".)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:35:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/713/713680f05c956b2cce4aa6898f4fdd93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["Human Entertainment"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Human Entertainment", "AllGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
