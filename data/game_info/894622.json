What are the rules?<br/>If you are a really Sudoku solver then you will master the game within seconds! Although solving a daily Sudoku puzzle can be quite hard, the rules of our online suduko game are very easy. A sudoku puzzle is a grid of nine by nine squares, which is additionally further divided into nine sub-grids of three by three squares each. Follow our tips in the game as well.<br/><br/>The numbers 1 to 9 must be entered into the sudoku puzzle in such a way that:<br/>- in each horizontal row each number appears only once<br/>- in each vertical column each number appears only once<br/>- in each sub grid each number occurs only once<br/><br/>This is also where the name of the puzzle comes from: sudoku in Japanese means something like \"numbers only once\". How hard can it be?<br/><br/>Solving sudoku puzzles, contrary to what you might think at first glance, does not require mathematical knowledge, but only logical understanding (instead of numbers, you could in principle use letters or other symbols, as long as there are nine different symbols).<br/><br/>In a sudoku puzzle, some numbers are already filled in; those numbers are \"given\" and may not be changed. Easy levels have more numbers filled in compared to hard or expert.<br/><br/>It is the puzzler's task to fill in the daily puzzle further, such that the above requirements are met.<br/><br/>In practice, this proves to be an addictive daily online and offline activity, and sudoku puzzles have therefore enjoyed growing popularity since the middle of 2005.<br/><br/>Are you ready to play this free sudoku board game?
