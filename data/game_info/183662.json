It was actually never made in its original form, but was repurposed in a revised \"MVP\" version that became the original SumoCheckers. Although I\u00a0originally envisioned it as a VR remake, doing the jam after working hours took its toll and I've kept it as simple as possible for the sake of releasing it - including all the throwback to the (quasi-cringy at this point) original lore and excluding all the cool features like board effects and special abilities.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for updates (maybe!)</p>\n\r\n\"The only honest thing about this story that is shoved down our throats is the name of our nation: Dystopia. We don't want an utopia, just to revive the old notion of an existence lost for God knows how many years - one in which man is responsible for their destiny and their actions. I don't know what year is this. I don't know how many generations have been through this distortion of reality - I\u00a0just know that every time a Labeouf gets old and suddenly changes appearence to no one's notice, I\u00a0lose more and more track of time. I just know this: 1894 was a long time ago. I do know this:\u00a0this is the year where we will take existence back.
