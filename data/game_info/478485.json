It's about a robot named Wamy who tries to save his creator. Unfortunately I didn't implement all the game mechanics and so the game is quite short and not entertaining. In my eyes it's still a success, because with this game jam I achieved my goal of making a game in one week and learned a lot that I can improve on in the next game. Please feel free to give me feedback on this game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5e/e5e7f23ff700b5e5aa9938a37f94ecec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["teddev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
