Not very great, has a very minimal story and all the voice acting is done by me. Suffice to say, it isn't great. Don't get hyped.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plot Synopsis</strong></p>\n<p>Kris is one of the automated robots at an old, rundown mine that has had all of the equipment stripped from it. There is no longer any staff, machines nor lifelines around. You have been given the night shift to monitor the robots before the company can find a good way of removing them from the premises. Shock them if they enter your office, and all should be well. That is, if Kris is calm with that notion.</p>\n\n<p><em>Jak standing in the office corridor</em></p>\n<p><strong>Release Date</strong></p>\n<p>February 2021 (If I don't abandon this trash heap beforehand)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T03:32:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcb/fcb1b8d929f61990581ea41a70cf18f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghostbin Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
