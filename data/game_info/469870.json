You control a character that is running down a beach attempting to destroy sandcastles and dodge rubbish bags.<br/>Simple - right?!<br/>Yeah, it's simple - sorry!<br/></p><p>Controls are just WASD, but if you hit the top of the screen then you lose.<br/>And, because I love you all, the controls aren't customisable!\u00a0(\"Can this game get any better??\")</p>\n<p>This is developed completely by myself (a full stack webdev, who wildly over judged how hard it would be to make a game).<br/>I'm proud of this project, and I apologise that the art is terrible. Like I said, I'm a webdev, we learn as we go!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:15:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed9e6b86ce222f0119fc86714b857d09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustCarty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
