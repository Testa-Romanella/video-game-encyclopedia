This is represented in the level by the two vision modes: Red-lit for a positive mood, where we see the platforms and our goal to reach, Blue-lit for a negative mood where we see the dangers ahead.\r\n For completing a level, the player gains an ability that relates to the specific disorder in a way, in Bi-Polar\u2019s case, the player is able to split itself in two, and use this on completing further levels.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A \u2013 D or Arrow Keys :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Left and right movement\r\n  </p>\n<p>Space : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hold for Dash/Jump\r\n  </p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Split\r\n  </p>\n<p>Q :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pick-up Clone\r\n  </p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throw Picked-up Clone\r\n  </p>\n<p>E :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Destroy Clone\r\n  </p>\n<p>Escape : \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Menu\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thank you for trying out our game!\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Lilli and Kevin from the Sinking Ship team</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T08:06:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e4/8e41793a022390b8c78c45c183c24933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Keletiszel", "WizardKitten"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
