(the truth pirates from it strongly are upset and fall into violence).<br/><br/>- It is possible to collect objects and to plunder chests only to a final whistle - at least one opponent is still alive (that a little inconveniently and forces other crew members to run from blows while one plunders everything that comes across).<br/><br/>- On the stolen gold it is possible to buy the same pirates.<br/><br/>- Weapon has a resource, and breaks at the most inappropriate moment, leaving the seaman with barehanded - and it at the levels a little therefore more powerful weapon should protect and be not to spent for weak opponents.<br/><br/>- During the game it is possible to switch to any seaman (so far he gives signs of life of course). It is impossible to switch to pirates - for management it is necessary to allocate with them the seaman.<br/><br/>- During fight it is possible to transfer weapon from one other seaman, in turn using it.<br/><br/>- For passing of final fight - at least 6 pistols are required - they are at the previous level, but there it is better not to spend them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T13:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b3/6b363355d0b714c3d3e1746e500d834f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 423, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["White Byte Software"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["White Byte Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
