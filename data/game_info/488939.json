You are placed in the role of a formally defeated dynasty tasked with reclaiming your former land. You get to choose from a few different backgrounds: 'Wolff\u00a0(German), Everred (English), Ragnar (Norse)'. These effect your homeland and the final fight between your dynasty and your conquerors.</p>\r\nA thank you:\r\n<p>I'm glad to have you here with us as I distribute my game onto itch.io. I am releasing the game on steam for free as well. I hope you guys enjoy my project/experiment! I tried to cram some cool stuff in there. I really think that everyone should be able to try it for free. Message me or leave a comment on something about the game. I like to pride myself on being in touch with my community so let me know! I would love to eventually see some screenshots of some of your kingdoms on here.</p>\r\nPLEASE DO NOT PAY/TIP :\r\n<p><strong>Seriously</strong>, I am not interested in anyone's money. I make games for fun and because it gives me good programming practice.\u00a0I think game design is one of the hardest, and most rewarding, forms of art (sounds stupid until you've tried it yourself lol)!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to help out: recommend the game to a friend, every download helps!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dev Twitter:</strong></p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/ImCowboyDev</p>\r\n-CowboyDev\r\n<p>A tip: look over the control scheme before your first game. Can seem overwhelming at first because all features are thrown at once.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T06:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a340a92f8a424e374b4d242650bb5cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CowboyDev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
