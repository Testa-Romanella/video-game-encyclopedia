Today, we put the grimoire of the Renaissance magus  in your hands.</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cOnly for you, children of doctrine &amp; learning, have we  written this work. Examine this book, ponder the meaning we have  dispersed in various places &amp; gathered again; what we have concealed  in one place we have disclosed in another, that it may be understood by  your wisdom.\u201d</em>\r\n -Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Codex Superno</strong> is a new sourcebook from the designers of <strong>Codex Martialis</strong>,  which introduces the dimension of magic derived from mythological and  historical sources. Since the early days of fantasy genre literature,  authors have invented magic very loosely based on the legends and  mythology of the ancient world. Tabletop role playing games have  inherited these magic systems and made them their own, with further  changes and modifications that make it all more logical and easier to  play with. We have become comfortable with these derivative genres and  they are familiar to us.\r\n </p>\n<p>But should magic ever be familiar or comfortable? Have you ever  wondered what sources Lovecraft or Robert E Howard, Michael Moorcock or  Jack Vance were inspired by when they made up their own legends of the  supernatural and the uncanny? Who was the inspiration for Abdul Alhazred  or the Necromonicon? Who were the real wizards of the ancient world,  and what were the real forbidden books they kept in their libraries?\r\n </p>\n<p>From the time of knightly swords and armor, castles and Cathedrals,  there were real grimoires and very real practitioners of magic, all of  whom left their own mark on history however big or small. Many can be  read today in their own voices, in fact more of the real ancient  grimoires, treatises on alchemy and a wide variety of esoteric  literature written centuries ago have been transcribed and translated  today than at any other time since they were originally put to paper.\r\n </p>\n<p>Suitable for a medieval historical or fantasy RPG setting, <strong>Codex Superno</strong>  is a new gaming supplement which takes you to a place where someone was  just as likely to rely on a magic talisman for protection as they were  upon steel armor and the edge of a sharp sword. The world of Copernicus,  Albrecht D\u00fcrer, and Christine de Pisan was awakening to reason and the  liberating promise of technology, but it was also a realm of sorcery and  the occult. Dr Faustus, Cornelius Agrippa, and John Dee walked the same  streets, and their skills were very much in demand.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Codex Superno</strong> opens the hidden cellar door to the spells, the  alchemy, the talismans and amulets, the grimoires and practitioners of  this other place centuries in the past. It is a domain at once  surprisingly contemporary and familiar, while simultaneously alien and  dangerous. Prepare if you will to enter the capricious, mystical,  syncretic realm of a character you might never have encountered before:  The Renaissance Magus.\r\n        \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T07:02:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/880/88059093f3b7f0b0648f96f292d5c3d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Codex Integrum"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
