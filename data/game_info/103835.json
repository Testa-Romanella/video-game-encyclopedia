However, things will not be so simple. Along with their \r\nobjective, a special clause has been placed on each person; a Death \r\nRule.<br/>No one knows what the other Player's objectives are, or what \r\nRule had been placed upon them. Being alone is a disadvantage, but in a \r\ndeadly game such as this, how do you know who to trust?</p><p><em>Note: Please download this file if you have received a 'Interface' object has no attribute 'focused' error.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f606aea7908a0098d370c50373236d7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hijiri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
