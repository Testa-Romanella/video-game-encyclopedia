After activating it something went wrong and his house would be in a quantum lock. The rooms, windows, and objects would change when not observed\u00a0due to quantum mechanics until the\u00a0player would have to fix the machine causing it.</p>\n\n<p>We unfortunately ran out of time so we just put in the mechanics that would be used. We also had an amazing sound designer who made all the sounds and music needed for the game but we were unable to implement them.</p><p>You can find them here:\u00a0https://clyp.it/user/4wdbov4w</p>\n\n<p>Press \"K\" to cause a quantum shift to set the doors and windows. Objects will always change when not viewed (sometimes).</p>\n\n<p>Sound designer's soundcloud:</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/user-312084825<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60d/60d99676e715869c436fd01feca85b63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave22153", "Arjuna Gonzales", "Edwin Baranov"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
