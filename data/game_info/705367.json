By matching rows you will damage your enemy. If the health bar go empty you win. While you try to break some rows, the boss can attack you by adding other bricks, so as to increase your grid to the top. When you (or the boss make you)\u00a0reach the summit, the game is over. In your help there are some tetraminos with special powers, like paralysis and poison. In the end, have fun and break those bricks!\r\n</p>\n<p>Reminder: This game is an end year project made in 1 month and half of work and this is a prototype with only 1 level. We are pleased if you can write here all your thoughs about this game, beacause this idea can be updated and completed in the future.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Designer:</strong> Di Domenico Indigo- illeggendarioreietto07@gmail.com\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer:</strong> Munaro Filippo Alberto - munaro.filippo@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T11:21:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e7/5e704a729f5512353509eb8d5f9e14d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Leggendario Reietto"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
