Go through a very challenging route with save points as you try to explore further and discover the secrets of the alien world you landed on. Reach new biomes, navigate through\u00a0a plethora of alien environments and face their bosses on your journey going down to the unknown.<strong><br/><br/>This is a challenging game.</strong> The Tiny Depths might be tiny in pixel resolution &amp; palette colours\u00a0but it is a completed title and it\u00a0is quite big size-wise. It is difficult to beat it on one seat and will definitely put the player's platform skills to the test. Therefore saving your game on the savepoints you encounter and return again later on to continue is recommended.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>-<strong> Z</strong>: Fire/Enter/Skip<br/>-\u00a0<strong>Arrow Keys L/R</strong>: Move The Player Left &amp; Right<br/>- <strong>Arrow Key Up</strong>: Jump<br/>- <strong>GamePad</strong> is supported and highly recommended in case\u00a0you own one.<br/>- You may also use your <strong>mouse</strong>\u00a0in the game menus.<br/></p>\n<p>If you enjoy the game and you would like to have it on the go, it is also available on Google\u00a0 Play store for mobile android devices.
