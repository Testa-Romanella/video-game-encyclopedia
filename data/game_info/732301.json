While it is a demo version, it has the beginning, substantial content, and multiple, self-contained endings. Of course, the plot fits into the full game but you can play this as a short yet fully functional\u00a0stand-alone game.</p>\r\n\r\nRoleplaying\r\n<p>This is the most important part of the game - you can play whatever character you wish, play however you want to. You can be a\u00a0<strong>smooth talker</strong>,\u00a0<strong>sneaky hacker,</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>brawling bully</strong>; or something else - it's your choice: distribute the points in\u00a0<strong>character creation</strong>\u00a0and make\u00a0<strong>decisions when playing</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\nMultiple solutions\r\n<p>There are always\u00a0<strong>multiple ways</strong>\u00a0to solve problems (<em>quests</em>), usually tied to your character skills and abilities - play to your character's strengths, work around its weaknesses. For example, if you cannot\u00a0<em>convince</em>\u00a0someone to help you,\u00a0<em>hack</em>\u00a0his computer and blackmail him. Or just straight-up\u00a0<em>pickpocket</em>\u00a0the guy - all items are always realistically placed in NPC inventories.\r\n\r\nNote:\u00a0there are usually<strong>\u00a03-8 ways to complete a quest</strong>\u00a0in the game. They can trigger related events in near future or lead to a different ending in the end slides.\r\n</p>\r\nChoice &amp; Consequence\r\n<p>Your actions, your decisions\u00a0<strong>matter to the game world</strong>. Make an enemy, you may need him/her later on. Opt for an easier solution to the current problem and you might have to deal with a bigger problem later. And in the end, you will get a\u00a0<strong>unique game-ending</strong>\u00a0showing you the future fate of your character and those who he/she impacted through gameplay.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nNon-linear world\r\n<p>You have an objective but how you approach it - it's up to you; the game map is as open to you as reasonably possible (it's a stranded spaceship after all) and there is no single true path to the end. If you know where to go, what to do - you can try to sequence break the game. Combine that with multiple solutions to every quest and you've got the freedom to spare.\r\n</p>\r\nOptional but unlimited violence\r\n<p>You can complete the game without killing anyone. In fact,\u00a0<strong>combat is completely optional</strong>. But if you want to fight - there are\u00a0<strong>no immortal or \"essential\" NPCs</strong>\u00a0- everyone everywhere has a finite amount of HP and is fair game.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\nTurn-based combat\r\n<p>The game features old-school\u00a0<strong>tactical turn-based combat</strong>\u00a0with grid-based movement, action points, and dice rolls.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T15:16:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a14/a1418290c5037ecc26f491057af8ea9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["kamazs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
