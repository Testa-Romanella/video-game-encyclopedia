Depending on the gradually increasing difficulty of the tasks, the number of elements and the complexity of the coherence is rising.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWorking on the microcircuits doesn\u2019t come easy for every engineer. And this is the work the player has to assume.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA young engineer named Adam, who\u2019s working in the silicon industry, will induct you into the work.
