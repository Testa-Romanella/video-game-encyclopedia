I made 3 small songs.</p>\n<p>2 - I made 3 Levels. Level 1 is on Earth. Level 2 is in the Solar System. Level 3 is in another star system. They get progressively harder by raising the amount of enemies you have to defeat and introducing another one of the enemies from the given assets.</p>\n<p>3 - Endless mode.</p>\n<p>4 - Using the textures from the last project, I made sprites of the Sun, and planets of the solar system which are mainly in Level 2.</p>\n<p>The smaller modifications are:</p>\n<p>1 - I added a background to the main menu you can interact with.</p>\n<p>2 - I added a retry level button to the game over screen.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>JHT's Planet Pixel Emporium (\u00a0http://planetpixelemporium.com/earth8081.html) for the earth texture I used for the background of Level 1.</p>\n<p>Michigan State University for the textures from the last project\u00a0I used to make my own\u00a0solar system sprites for Level 2.</p>\n<p>Created By Jean Toribio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T08:15:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d64c8e4ce9d56b4307523d3a692427b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["JeanTori"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
