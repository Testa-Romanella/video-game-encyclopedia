Multiplayer Content - This being that 1-8 player or more could play on the same world file giving the opportunity for groups to assist team mates.</p><p>2. Collection System - Being that currently the only goal is the reach the end of the run we would like to add some complexity to this and add in a collection system.</p><p>         - Items to collect - Hidden threw-out the map/maps will items to collect ranging from Grass Chucks, Stones, Bark, Diamonds, Blood Diamonds. Each item will have a use to it which could give perks to the upcoming maps.</p><p>3. Proper LeaderBoard - To do this how we would like the Multiplayer Content would first have to be online along with a host of other things so this will be late game content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf66413b3bfa8a407e9e56792c896bae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WastedHP"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
