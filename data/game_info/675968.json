They will carry the items away as fast as they can. The more items the estate sale company picks up, the more money you make. They're on a strict schedule so move quickly, but be careful not to let one side of the house get too heavy!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Up, Down, Left, Right Arrows for movement.</p>\n<p>Play Game:</p>\n<p>Download .zip, extract, find the LudumDare49.exe to launch the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:16:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58e/58ec6bfa086c2b0588208b9b5dd7cd61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["the.digital.shay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
