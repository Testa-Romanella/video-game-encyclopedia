Only this wolf is more of a shapeshifting alien posing as one of 10 potential, and very expensive, war clones. In a future where wars are fought by proxy by mass cloning farms, humans have taken a backseat to warfare. Now, in the year 3343, play as a singular human maintenance worker standing watch at an automated facility. You awake to find something has gone very wrong. Power is out in half the facility, and you must kill the alien before you run out of clones!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:24:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9d7aab8d1a33e2a68c46f9efaa993da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShadowBand"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
