Z to attack and hold X for charge attack 1, 2 or 3. Level up your anger and unlock more moves by chaining more hits, level up to 2 at 40x, to 3 at 100x, getting hit will break the combo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First project</strong> to\u00a0learn programming and game deving hence the simple premise, there is a platform bug that is fixed by jumping, hitboxes sometimes one shot Gondola too for some reason. Birds wander around the map and get stuck.\u00a0Time stops working on reset, Music and SFX slider don't work,\u00a0etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Game is full of bugs</strong>. Sadly I wasn't able to fix most of them in time for the Jam and I'm still learning how colliders and stuff in Unity works in general. Hopefully the gamebreaking bugs won't happen, in that case Challenge Mode showcases the gameplay better.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Leave honest feedback, thanks.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T05:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebb7c15a21cb1dd5eb7859736053dd01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DanteMasamune"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
