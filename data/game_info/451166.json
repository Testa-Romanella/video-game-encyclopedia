I guess it's a bit more on the story side but it was fun to make. It's a little rough and I would like to improve the sound and add more to it at a later date at some point\u00a0 but it will do for now. I have only been learning game dev for about 1.5 weeks so this was fun to do and satisfying to finish and get uploaded. Thank you for playing it.</p>\n<p>All art and music was done by myself.
