There are currently four team members, two planners, one program, and one artist.<br/>The inspiration for making this game came from an accidental whim when playing a script to kill. How about turning these evidence-gathering links into actual scenarios? Can you restore every link of the detective's case-solving in a more immersive way?<br/>When I first came up with this idea, every member of the team was very excited. Although everyone had never tried a puzzle-solving game, everyone played Ace Attorney and watched The Kindaichi Case Files grow up.<br/>We spent a lot of time on this product, from project approval to a little bit of implementation, we painfully found that the game we made was quite different from the original imagination. After two or three overthrows and redoes, it finally ended in face is presented before you.<br/>This is not a perfect work, but an exploratory attempt by our studio is an explanation for the small idea at the beginning, the determination to do what it says, and the serious work for so long.<br/>I would like to thank every friend in the studio for their hard work and dedication after countless quarrels; I would like to thank all the classic reasoning games we have played for the inspiration, and I would like to thank all the family members and family members who have helped in the process of making the game. Friends, thanks to all players!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T04:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1b766fd36277159ad521e4c91cb4217.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5409\u7965\u5982\u610f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5409\u7965\u5982\u610f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
