Their leader, the Blue Wizard, had used much of his power to create potions and objects that could give magical abilities to others as well. His pupil, the Orange Wizard, wanted to shape the land in his own image and saw a chance to stage a coup and depose the Blue Wizard in his weakened state.</p>\n<p>Without his powers or fellow wizards, the Blue Wizard was powerless to stop the Orange Wizard and fled from those he had once called his brothers. With nowhere to go, the Blue Wizard looked to the sky and saw a magical vision of an average man who lived within the borders of the land that the wizard\u2019s controlled.</p>\n<p>With nothing left to lose, the Blue Wizard sets off towards an unsuspecting forest dweller with the intention to grant him his magical abilities, and send him off on a quest to stop the Orange Wizard and his minions. There isn\u2019t much time until the land is corrupted and the wizards control all.</p>\n<p>This is Gerald\u2019s Journey.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Arrow Keys/AD - Move Left and Right\r\n  </p>\n<p>Space - Jump/Double Jump\r\n  </p>\n<p>Shift - Hold to Sprint\r\n  </p>\n<p>F - Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T16:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/50357d68b64733371825b29ac2758cfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vennator"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
