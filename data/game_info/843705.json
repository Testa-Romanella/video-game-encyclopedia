Anyways I'm from the Czech Republic and this is my first time participating in Game Jam, I'm not the best when it comes to Unity but I got a solid hang of the basics. Most of the things were drawn by me in Photoshop while the SFX were done by my brother, literally, every single sound effect was voiced by him, yeah we got a few weird looks from our neighbours after we were done recording and I don't think you'll blame them after hearing the sound effects. I apologize in advance for any possible bugs or errors but nonetheless I hope you will enjoy the game.<br/>   Cheers\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T14:31:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac9/ac95b5e2364bbb32a5cece00da6fd0aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ondrator"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
