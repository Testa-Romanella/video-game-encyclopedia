{"id": 465646, "slug": "outta-control-2", "name": "Outta Control!", "name_original": "Outta Control!", "description": "<p>In this game made for GMTK Game Jam 2020, use your mouse to guide your blue character to collect green dots, and avoid red ones. Don't take too long, because you're racing to collect green dots to not only hit a score of 35 and win the game, but to keep the Control Meter at the bottom from running out! If it does, you'll enter \"Outta Control!\" mode, during which your character's controls are reversed, they become much faster, and enemies spawn in much more quickly. Your health, displayed above your character,\u00a0will also drop to one, so be careful to not get hit, or you'll lose!</p>\n<p>While grabbing green dots, consider your location on the map - green dots spawn much more frequently in the tight corridors of the left side of the map, but do you really want to risk boxing yourself in if an enemy comes in? Maybe the open spaces of the right side, allowing more avenues to escape, is more your speed!<br/><br/>Built in Unity by myself. Please pardon the programmer art!\u00a0You always think you'll have more time leftover for those cool characters or clean animations. :)\u00a0<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Game theme:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Digital Lemonade by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3648-digital-lemonade<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></p>\n\n<p>Panic Mode theme:</p>\n<p>Split In Synapse by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4408-split-in-synapse<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/><br/>Scream:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/thanvannispen/sounds/9431/<br/><br/>Coin collect:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/syseQ/sounds/267528/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:35:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fee/fee9a955cbf21418fd4284f321b9ce46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Intrapath"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
