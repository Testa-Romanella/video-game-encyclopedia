This game was made following the inspiration from my last puzzle platform game, Rectangular Adventure.<br/><br/>The idea is to make a puzzle platform game utilizing abilities to move around the stage, challenging players to utilize their creativity to solve the problem of reaching from point A to B with obstacles in the middle.<br/><br/>This project was originally made by 2 people, with me heading the design with a classmate helping with the programming. The game was supposed to be made using Unity.</p><p>Due to unforseen circumstances, my partner dropped out of the project and I have to redo the entire thing from scratch, mostly due to the fact that I am unable to read his codes and the programming language due to my lack of programming knowledge. To make matters worse, it was 2 months till the final project deadline.<br/><br/>I remade the game using Stencyl, which during the current moment was the only game engine that I could use.<br/><br/>Hence, many mechanics have to be dropped from this transition from Unity to Stencyl. But in the end I made it after massive rushing. </p><p>(P.S. go to \"view\" and set to \"See All\" for the best setting)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3d/e3d3777c9073800c92f8fdf335966403.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yjchua90gamedev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
