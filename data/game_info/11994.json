Evade increasingly aggressive locals, utilize special abilities, all to complete your mission.<br/><br/><h3>Your mission is to retrieve five force crystals to the monolith.</h3>Your sole and only purpose is to deliver force crystals back to a monolith. Weave and dodge around asteroids by utilizing realistic space physics, and have your flight somewhat regulated by a slight drag force applied when going too fast.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Locals have noticed your presence and will get more aggressive over time.</h3>You are not alone on your mission, and not in a good way. For some reason, locals don't want you to complete your mission and will do their best to stop you. The further you progress and longer you take, the more aggressive ships they'll send, ranging from police ships to military battleships.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Utilize various abilities to keep yourself safe from the locals.</h3>As you retrieve force crystals, you will unlock new abilities to utilize to make your mission easier. You can use them to outwit the locals, avoid an asteroid collision, or just accelerate the speed of your mission.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Survive as long as possible after completing your mission.</h3>Once the mission is complete, you have only one objective: survive. Utilize abilities and the skills you have learned to fight even more aggressive locals, as they throw their most powerful forces your way.<h3>Why is Envoy a free game?</h3>Envoy was made for the summer flowjam 2023 game jam, and is a free game available on the web. <br/>Additionally, it is being listed on Steam for free because it <strong>lacks</strong> the following:<br/><ul><li>Precise volume (game can be muted), graphics, resolution, and keybinding settings.<br/></li><li>A pause menu.<br/></li><li>More than 30 minutes of gameplay.<br/></li><li>Support for controllers or users without a computer mouse.</li></ul><strong>Please be aware of these when downloading the game!!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T09:26:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a63/a6359489dae3786fe6a7a36e75791147.jpg", "website": "https://flowlab.io/game/play/2346662", "rating": 2.71, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 143, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 390, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NCE Software Games", "Sup3r87 games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nova Dimension", "Sup3r87 games"], "esrb_rating": null}
