Permadeath and different stages everytime you start a game? This game has it all!<br/></p>\n<p>Force, parkour, shoot, dodge and switch your way through this game! But before you do that, let me warn you! Once you've entered the Force-Underground, the madness starts! ... Well, at first it (maybe) isn't real madness, but once you meet the Guardian... If you want to give yourself a challenge and if you can handle RAGING, you should give the Force-Underground definitely a visit!
