Use your skills as a master builder to pave your way through the chasm and into freedom.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Game should work using keyboard or gamepad devices. For the gamepad button names I'm assuming an Xbox-like controller. It should work with the equivalent buttons in other controllers, but I haven't tested any other.</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys / WASD or Left Stick / D-pad: Move Daedalus in normal mode, and move blocks in placement mode.</li><li>Q/E keys or Left/Right pad shoulder buttons: In placement mode, rotate blocks left/right, respectively.</li><li>C key or A button: Confirm placement, and Accept option in most menus.</li><li>X key or B button: Cancel placement. Bear in mind that this will delete the block and could leave you stuck on a level. Use wisely! :wink: </li></ul>\r\nTools and due credit:\r\n<ul><li>Unity v2019.3b4 with Visual Studio 2017.</li><li>Aseprite.</li><li>Fonts used are Apostrophic Labs' Diogenes and Codeman38's Press Start 2P.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T06:18:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78a6b7395ee40ed1286c462d741c1471.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ithildin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
