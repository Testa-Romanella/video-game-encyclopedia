I wanted to create a simple puzzle game which was impossible to lose (no puzzle is impossible nor can you get into an unwinnable situation), had no enemies which required timing or dexterity to avoid / beat (they have none!!!), and starred as main characters - their bedtime teddies!</p>\n<p>There are 15 levels and your goal is to help the Green Teddy find his pal Red Teddy, navigating the house, baby gates, collecting candy, and re-uniting them!</p>\n<p>It's pretty simple and harmless, has a very young audience in mind, and has been a blast to develop alongside my kids. Hope you enjoy too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T05:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e79/e798004e56bea16ea8554fa7776cdb02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Birthday Horse Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
