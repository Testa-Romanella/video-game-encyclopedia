{"id": 290961, "slug": "tactical-control", "name": "Tactical Control", "name_original": "Tactical Control", "description": "Tactical Control is a strategy game for people who aren't strategy gamers. It is a real-time tactics game that does not reward actions-per-minute, memorized build orders and hard unit counters. It is also an experiment, to see if visuals are actually that important in a strategy game, or merely a distraction.Features:<br/><ul><li> short one-on-one matches<br/></li><li> minimalist visuals with simple, clear graphics<br/></li><li> diverse unit types, each powerful when used correctly<br/></li><li> randomized armies: you must use what you have, but no two matches are the same<br/></li><li> free version: play online against random opponents<br/></li><li> premium version: pay once to unlock custom matches against friends <strong>(NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)</strong><br/></li><li> players connect directly to each other, not to servers that might be hacked or shut down</li></ul>Gameplay:<br/><strong>Matches:</strong> TC matches are duels between two opponents. Each player starts with a base and seven units of various types. The base cannot move or attack. Players must use their units to destroy the enemy base and defend their own.<br/><br/><strong>Unit Control:</strong> Click any of your units to select it, so you can give orders to that unit. Click the map to order your unit to move. Click the unit itself to order it to stop.<br/><br/><strong>Combat:</strong> While a unit is selected, click an enemy to attack. Most units can move and attack at the same time. However, if the enemy is out of range, your units will not attack.<br/><br/><strong>Visibility:</strong> The two bases are always visible, but the armies aren't. Enemy units are visible only if one of your units is close enough to see them. Each unit type has a \"visibility\" radius, where enemy units will detect it. Units who fired recently have greatly increased visibility, for a short time. For hidden enemy units, their last known position is displayed by a blinking icon. When the battle starts, the players can see what units the enemy has and their starting positions.<br/><br/><strong>Unit types:</strong> Each type of unit is different, with its own strengths and weaknesses. To win, players must use each unit correctly and in cooperation with the rest of the army. See unit list below for detailed descriptions of each unit type.<br/><br/><strong>Emplaced units:</strong> Some unit types cannot fire for a short time after they move. This is indicated by a bar that slowly fills up while the unit is immobile. After the bar is full, the unit can open fire on any enemy inside its attack range. If the unit moves, the bar instantly becomes empty and must fill up again before the unit can attack.Unit types:<ul><li><strong>B</strong> The Base. Bases cannot move or attack. They are always visible to the enemy. Losing your base means losing the match.<br/></li><li><strong>M</strong> Main Battle Mechs. Balanced all-round performance with an emphasis on durability.<br/></li><li><strong>H</strong> Heavy Weapons. Long-range artillery, powerful but fragile. Emplaced: requires 20s after moving before it can fire.<br/></li><li><strong>R</strong> Raiders. Fast and stealthy but fragile under fire.<br/></li><li><strong>A</strong> Assault. Powerful and durable but very slow and visible from a long distance.<br/></li><li><strong>S</strong> Skirmishers. Long-range but fragile when attacked.<br/></li><li><strong>T</strong> Towed Turrets. Fast, stealthy and powerful defenders. Emplaced: requires 10s after moving before it can fire.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c55e1049eb298b324c2021552632fa27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hellride Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hellride Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
