Rise to the top (literally) while battling your way through sentient drones, punching and kicking pipes to make them explode and FLY!\r\n<p>A fairly simple arcade game, BPU started out as a team project but everyone except me had to bail by the end of the first day thanks to unexpected issues. And thus, I ended up doing the whole thing solo, which turned out to be quite the learning experience (this is also why the pixel art is so effin fantastic). I hope your survive it, I somehow did.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\nGuide\r\n<p>To play, punch or kick while next to a platform to keep yourself from falling and to send the damned platforms to the afterlife. If you\u2019re stuck, you can press the swap button to swap to the opposite side of the platform. The game is an endless score chase, so there\u2019s no real end state. <br/></p>\n<p>Punching the platform tilts it (and you upwards), while kicks tilt it downwards. Punching/kicking longer adds more power to the explosion. Adjust the angle at which you wish to be fly, smash in your power levels and then strap in for the ride! The explosion occurs after a short delay from when you stop attacking, so don't let up on it until you're sure you're fine!<br/></p>\n<p>Advanced: </p>\n<ul><li>The platform explodes if you stop interacting with it, so if you wish to alter direction/swap sides, you have a limited time window in which you can input a new command.</li><li>You can attack platforms you\u2019re not facing my timing your attack right as you fly close to them.</li><li>If you manage to attack an enemy (its hard), you get a super air boost.</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<p>In the order of [Mouse]\u2026.[Dualshock]\u2026.[Xbox]</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Punch</strong>: [Left Click]\u2026.[Cross(X)]\u2026.[A]</li><li><strong>Kick</strong>: [Right Click]\u2026.[Circle]\u2026.[B]</li><li><strong>Swap</strong>: [Middle Mouse]\u2026.[Square]\u2026.[X] (can also use left bumper)</li><li><strong>Restart Menu</strong>: [Escape]\u2026.[Start]\u2026.[Start]</li></ul>\n<p>Controls can be edited in the standalone executable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Release Notes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>v1.0<ul><li>LD41 First Release</li></ul></li><li>v1.01<ul><li>Fixed invisible cursor</li><li>Fixed restart going to main menu instead of restarting game</li><li>Added gamepad support to menu navigation</li></ul></li><li>v1.02<ul><li>Fixed menu looping bug for mouse</li><li>Fixed some platform generation bugs</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Thank you for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96b9766a2621dee052aadd7ccbd18f0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Reizo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
