And were you always afraid they would die? No?</p>\n<p>Now it's your change to prove to the world (and your grandma in particular) that you can look after the plants. While she is away for a month, you have to water them or not. Good luck!</p><p>A little tip: Some plants need water every 3 days, others once every 14 days.
