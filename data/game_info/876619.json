{"id": 876619, "slug": "revolution-4", "name": "r//Evolution", "name_original": "r//Evolution", "description": "<p>r//Evolution is a two-chapter hybrid game developed in Twine and Unity. Twine allowed for depth to the story (Chapter 091) whilst Unity (Chapter 092) allowed for interactivity and visuals that Twine does not support. This game was experimental in this sense and attempted to explore what each of these two platforms could offer in terms of narrative game development.</p>\n<p>The central character is Iara though you play as Iara's boyfriend. I developed this female lead,\u00a0inspired by Lily in the Fedran universe which was part of a game design studio course brief at University of Edinburgh. Her story starts in Kormar but continues in Tarsan and finally in Gepaul at Iara\u2019s house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Initially I wanted the the core mechanic to be solving a puzzle that advances the narrative but settled on a narrative simulator with lots of environmental sounds. The aesthetics aspires towards the feel of interiors in \u201cGone Home\u201d and \u201cL.A. Noire\u201d with a 1920s influence. The environment is inspired by landscapes in BC Canada. \u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T05:03:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/7685a6bc4bd323e3a78b6b1a711fa719.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["river_tam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
