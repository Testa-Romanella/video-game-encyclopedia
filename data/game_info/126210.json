Buggy, unoptimized and unpolished. Made in the span of two days.</p><p>- <strong>FreakOut - Fixed</strong> -&gt; The newer, post-jam build. Most of the bugs and other issues have been fixed, and the game is more balanced and polished.<br/><br/><br/>Hope you will have as much fun playing the game as Elvendan and I had making it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aa08c1fa58f53a66ecce70549e25f12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dunban"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
