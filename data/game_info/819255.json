Collect all 52 cards with the help of your trusty die to win! Be careful, however: These cards have a say in whether they willingly get picked up. Other lost pieces will help you survive as you traverse the four \"Suites\": The lush Club Forest, HearthTown, SpadesFort, and the Diamond Palace.<br/><br/>52 Pickup was inspired by the popular card game, 52 Pickup, in which the player picks up 52 cards.
