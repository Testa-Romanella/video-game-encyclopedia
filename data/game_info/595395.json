The theme was \u201cdeeper and deeper\u201d and what\u2019s deeper than the underworld itself?<br/></p>\n<p>Loosely based on Dante\u2019s Inferno, travel deeper and deeper into hell, running, jumping, and dashing through nine short levels. Face off against vicious bosses, sneak past hungry demons, and dodge falling pineapples all the while keeping Satan\u2019s pizza fully intact!\r\n</p>\n<p>The game features an original soundtrack composed by the talented William van Brennet. Each level has its own unique sound, so you\u2019ll be able to jam out the whole time. Journeying through hell has never sounded this good.\r\n</p>\n<p>All levels are unlocked and skippable, so if you get stuck you\u2019ll be able to play the rest of the game with no issues, but we\u2019d encourage you to start from the beginning to get the full experience!\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is the product of 72 hours of work for Ludum Dare 48. Enjoy the game!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our Links:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ryfi Games: https://www.ryfigames.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>William van Brennet: https://soundcloud.com/william-van-bremmet\r\n</p>\n<p>SandToise: https://sandtoise.itch.io/\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0vkaike2: https://vkaike2.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T13:44:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d7/4d7e78772d45c8e85bc5dcd1a84ee08d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryfi", "vkaike2", "William van Bremmet", "SandToise"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
