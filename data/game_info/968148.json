The tree is said to bear golden fruit, and whenever patient and courageous explorers set out on this arduous and challenging path, their hard work and determination will be richly rewarded at the end.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Rumor has it that only those who are in awe of and remain humble to the forces of nature and mystery may uncover the correct path to the Golden Tree.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Explorers usually have to undergo a series of severe trials and tribulations before they have a chance to find the legendary Golden Tree! However, even the toughest of people will encounter trials of the mind on their adventurous journeys. They must maintain their inner peace and stability and not be shaken by external distractions and temptations. It is only through the wisdom of the mind and the strength of the heart that the explorer can find the motivation to move forward in the midst of hardship and danger.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Every expedition is a unique experience, and each explorer will gain different insights and lessons in the search for the Golden Tree. Some may find themselves with a deeper sense of reverence for nature, leading to a stronger sense of cherishing it. While others may realize that wealth in itself does not give them true happiness, and that joy and fulfillment come from deep inner growth and discovery.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>When explorers finally touch the fruit of the Golden Tree, they will find a magical energy of shimmering gold emanating from the fruit. These fruits may seem ordinary, but when you touch them, you can feel a flow of energy like never before. The fruits of the Golden Tree represent the rewards of perseverance, wisdom and inner growth, and are not limited to material possessions.</li></ul><br/>From here on out, the explorers will return home with this invaluable experience and discovery, sharing the wisdom and courage they have learned with others. They will carry on the legend of the Golden Tree and inspire the next generation to continue to explore the unknown, face challenges with courage, and pursue the true gold within: wisdom, courage, and happiness. These explorers will always be the guardians of the Golden Tree, passing on its magical power and wisdom so that the legend will never die!<h3>Gameplay:</h3><ul><li>In the game, you can build up your power by holding down the button, which adjusts the strength of your flipping leap. You can decide how much force you want to jump as needed. This requires you to carefully observe the terrain and the target of your jump before you take off in order to choose the right amount of force to successfully skim over an obstacle or reach a specific target.</li></ul><ul><li>Another thing to keep in mind is the direction of your movement. You can use the arrow keys to control your character's movement, which means you can adjust the direction of your flipping leap by moving. This is very important because when flipping in the air, you can no longer adjust the direction of your flips.</li></ul><ul><li>Once you've mastered the game's simple controls, you'll realize that this game takes a lot of practice to become proficient at. You need to think carefully about your route before each leap, because once you leave the ground, there is no turning back! This means that you have to get your bearings in the air so that you don't jump in the wrong direction or fall into the turbulence!</li></ul><ul><li>Practice is very important to succeed in this game. You need to spend a lot of time to familiarize yourself with the operation of the game and master the skills. Only through constant practice will you be able to improve your accuracy and reaction speed so that you can reach a level of proficiency in the game.</li></ul><br/><strong>So, in order to explore the legendary Golden Tree, explorers are urged not to be afraid to spend time and effort. By carefully considering the choices before each leap, mastering the strength of the leap and the direction of movement, I believe that explorers will be able to explore the legendary golden tree that can bear golden fruits!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-23T02:38:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c48/c48ffb3491131120ac24842bd662cab3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WU HONG LIN"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WU HONG LIN"], "esrb_rating": null}
