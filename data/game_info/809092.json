Ill fix later tonight. I suggest waiting to play until tomorrow. :-P<br/></p>\n<p>Theme: Floating Cities<br/></p>\n<p>I wanted to take a shot at making\u00a0all of the art assets myself.\u00a0 So I decided to keep the game super simple... so I just made a simplified missile command knockoff.\u00a0 :-P</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>The year is is 2786.</p>\n<p>Human's have finally mastered high-tech ballooning technology. In doing so, we as a species have taken to the sky! But some less fortunate folks have been left behind... The \"grounded\" as they are called,\u00a0 have become\u00a0\u00a0jealous of our glorious floating paradise. So they send\u00a0 waves of missile's towards us in hopes of our destruction.</p>\n<p>This is where you come in...</p>\n<p>*note there is an issue where u can lose all of your turrets and the game wont end.\u00a0 ill fix this soon, so now u can just hit pause button and restart.<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>You have 6 cities to defend and 3 turrets. To use.</p>\n<p>Each turret contains 10 counter measures. Which refill at the beginning of each stage.</p>\n<p>10 Stages in total, increasing in difficulty.</p>\n<p>Turrets are controlled individually, when the launch key is pressed for the associated turret, it will launch a counter measure towards where your mouse cursor is pointing.</p>\n<p>Once the counter measure reaches its destination, it will explode. The idea is to time your counter measure to intercept the incoming missiles.</p>\n<p>You are given a score at the end of each stage based on how many missile's you destroy, countermeasure's you DONT use and cities you have left.</p>\n<p>Once you lose all 6 cities, the game will end.</p>\n<p>Default: (you can change this from main menu controls)<br/></p>\n<p>Aim with mouse</p>\n<p>A - Launch From Left\u00a0Turret</p>\n<p>S - Launch From Center Turret</p>\n<p>D - Launch From Right Turret</p>\n<p>Assets Used:<br/></p>\n<p>All of the hideous pixel art, is of my own doing.</p>\n<p>Music and Sounds -\u00a0https://sidearm-studios.itch.io/ultimate-music-bundle</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T06:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/474/4749b02bd989851e5b3d46c02b042d11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BobIsHere"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
