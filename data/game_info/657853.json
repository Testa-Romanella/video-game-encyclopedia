In the original design for this game, players use large, plushy lips to kiss each other at the same time. This game can lead to many silly, obnoxious, and laughable moments you're sure to remember with your partner for years to come.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:25:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b7/5b79c86065b8eea1c7aed5dc419217e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Aubrey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
