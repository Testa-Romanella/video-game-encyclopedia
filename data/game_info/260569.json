This was my first attempt at platforming melee combat and I think it went quite well. I also got good art practice while working on this. We've got\u00a0save points, menus, jump-through platforms, ledge climbing, melee combat, ranged combat, rolling, and lock on. I know this project is rather ambitious, so it\u2019s on the backburner for now, but I'd really love to get back to it.<br/><br/>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD: Movement</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p>J: Melee Attack</p>\n<p>K: Ranged Attack</p>\n<p>E: Interact</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/075/075c41807c99da15ac450c4a56ce7ddf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blstrManx"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
