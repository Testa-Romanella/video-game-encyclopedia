{"id": 19458, "slug": "doom-3", "name": "DOOM 3", "name_original": "DOOM 3", "description": "<p>DOOM 3 is a first-person shooter, the third installment in the series, serving as a reboot to the previous games. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>As the game is set in a science fiction universe, the events span accordingly. The year is 2145, and the technological progress has allowed humanity to set up different facilities on Mars. After an experiment goes wrong, the research center becomes inhabited by demons. The player controls a nameless space marine, fighting off hordes of enemies through a variety of levels. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The playable character employs a large arsenal of weaponry for his cause, from common firearms to the series\u2019s trademark BFG9000. Each level of the game is linear, as the player must often either retrieve information, some device or reach the checkpoint. However, there are numerous obstacles on the way to the objective: the protagonist has to fight off not only demons and their servants, but also combat the natural enemy in the form of darkness. </p>\n<h3>Graphics and music</h3>\n<p>The engine of the game incorporates lighting and shadowing, making every object in the game feel real and natural. The textures are designed to be unappealing, as a psychological tool to ensure the player\u2019s urge to get rid of the enemies and escape the dark and ruined corridors, but at the same time, the level of detail in each location and each enemy is very high.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2004-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:26:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3b0/3b01313965c19adc6b6c37a3d9d33576.jpg", "website": "https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en", "rating": 3.91, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 151, "owned": 2575, "beaten": 544, "toplay": 67, "dropped": 227, "playing": 30}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 225, "ratings_count": 595, "suggestions_count": 553, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 599, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Linux", "macOS", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox"], "developers": ["id Software", "Raven Software", "Panic Button", "Nerve Software", "Splash Damage", "Vicarious Visions"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks", "Aspyr", "Activison", "1C Company", "id Software", "Bethesda"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
