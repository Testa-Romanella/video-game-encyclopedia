{"id": 44973, "slug": "remnith", "name": "Remnith", "name_original": "Remnith", "description": "Remnith is a chaotic FPS where enemy units feed off of the energy of every shot that isn't lodged directly into them. The more you miss the stronger they get. Challenge enemies in over 25 arena battles spread over 3 levels with the choice of 5 difficulty levels. Arm yourself with gigantic multi-barrel energy cannons, refine your accuracy and dismantle machines piece by piece before can they have a chance to evolve any further.<br/><br/>Remnith can be played both with or without a VR headset. Motion controllers, gamepads and mouse &amp; keyboard setups are all supported. When using motion controllers you have a choice of a few locomotion options such as thumbstick/trackpad movement and teleportation. You can play either sitting or standing, the game isn't room-scaled but you do need a 360 setup if you're going to play standing without thumbstick/trackpad turning.<br/>Launching The Game:If you want to play desktop mode just launch the game normally. To play Vive mode run the game using SteamVR as you normally would. To play with the Rift, make sure SteamVR is closed and launch the game in Oculus VR Mode.<br/>Controls Overview:<strong>Vive</strong>-Shoot with your primary trigger, click your primary trackpad to jump and click the other trackpad to dash. To move you can use trackpads to move normally or use the secondary controller to point in the direction you want to go and push the trackpad outwards to control your speed. With traditional movement you have the choice of moving relative to the rotation of your head or controller. You turn physically by default but you can turn on trackpad turning in the settings. <br/><br/>For players using teleportation you just need to hold the trackpad or trigger on the secondary controller to select a point and release to teleport. Teleportation is instant by default but a fade can be added through the settings.<br/><br/><strong>Oculus Touch</strong>-Shoot with your primary trigger, dash with the secondary trigger and jump with A.
