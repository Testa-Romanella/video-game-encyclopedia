{"id": 1892, "slug": "nihilumbra", "name": "Nihilumbra", "name_original": "Nihilumbra", "description": "<p>Nihinlumbra is a video game by BeautiFun Games. It was released in 2012, and the first platform was iOS. The name is a mix of two Latin words, nihil meaning \u00abnothing\u00bb and umbra meaning \u00abdarkness.\u00bb </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The main character, Born, is a black creature soaring above the ground. He was born in absolute emptiness; his goal is to get out of it. Multiple enemies can\u2019t be defeated; the player can only avoid them. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Nihinlumbra is a classic platform game, so the gameplay includes jumping between hanging platforms and avoiding blocks. During the game, Born explores five different worlds: the Frozen Cliffs, the Living Forest, the Ash Desert, the Volcano, and the City. New platform versions offer alternative control methods. </p>\n<h3>Key feature</h3>\n<p>The main feature is the ability to color surroundings. Each level implies getting a new color that can modify the setting.<br />\nThe blue color makes surfaces slippery; the green color lets Born bounce, the brown makes the characters slower when they walk on it; the red burns the monsters, and the yellow conducts electricity. The graphics are performed in dark colors. Monsters are the same color as Born, black, and each of them is deadly. Quiet sound effects support the game.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2012-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dda/dda8007ccdcc71c467cacebba1c0035c.jpg", "website": "http://www.nihilumbra.com/", "rating": 3.4, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 67, "owned": 940, "beaten": 71, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 27, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 68, "ratings_count": 108, "suggestions_count": 376, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 109, "platforms": ["Wii U", "PS Vita", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "Android", "Linux", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["BeautiFun Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["BeautiFun Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
