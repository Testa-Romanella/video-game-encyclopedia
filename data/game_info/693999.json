Somewhat of dodge-em-up, but turn based when you attack (like Undertale? kids know what that is right).\u00a0There's only one battle, but has a complete\u00a0victory/death game loop at least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lot of things I want to do with this prototype, but the basic idea is there. I think it needs actual enemy AI to make the defensive/healing cards more viable. Of course more card effects and different enemy scenarios would also help.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Known invincibility bug that prevents you from dodging, didn't have time to fix it but it is known sorry!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to Move<br/>Spacebar to dodge<br/>Mouse to use the cards (right click to cancel using a card)</p>\n<p><em>This ain't your grandfather's cawd game yuug!<br/>-Joey Wheeler</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:40:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82d1c9947a3f8f4cbf1c2ed1d196b774.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Shweep"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
