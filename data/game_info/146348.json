To win: destroy all of your opponent's pieces, or \"simply\" occupy the opposing king's starting tile.</p>\n<p>The game is inspired by Chess and Shogi, but there is a catch: you queue up several moves in advance! Once you and your opponent have queued your moves, both turns play out at the same time!</p>\n<p>Local play on one device and network play are supported. Please make sure you and your opponent have opened a port and can connect to each other if you want to play a network game.</p>\n<p>Future development of this game is likely.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36b4afda489e94566adf9a0037413eda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jacic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
