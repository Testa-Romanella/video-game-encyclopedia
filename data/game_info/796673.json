Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.\r\n</p>\n<p>Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Carl found himself unable to move for the longest time.\r\n</p>\n<p>But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T14:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a4/2a4178019afbbee9e3227b0b93d432fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Worrell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
