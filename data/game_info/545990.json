The <strong>theme of the jam was \"Uncontrollable Fate\"</strong> so I decided to make a game about chasing after a tornado since weather is an uncontrollable fate. Storm Chaser is also my first 2D game and I really enjoyed the challenges and workflow of 2D. The game was designed and developed solely by me in 4 days and you find a list of assets I used below.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Jump/Double Jump - <em>Space</em></li><li>Fall Faster - <em>S</em>\u00a0or <em>Down Arrow</em></li></ul>\r\n\r\nThird Party Assets\r\n<ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-style-farm-animals</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/classic-car</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/spells-and-company</li><li>The Thunderstorm by Kraftamt (c) copyright 2013 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial\u00a0 (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/Karstenholymoly/41792 Ft: morgantj</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/gothicvania-swamp-152865</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/unity-particle-pack...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:00:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb0/bb08c4ab507a975acc2152f4918ada9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arya Vatan-Abadi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
