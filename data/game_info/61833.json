At launch TTS will feature 4 challenging mission that will test a pilots positional awareness and mastery of the unique \u201cThrust or Shoot\u201d gameplay we have developed.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/>    \u2022 You get to fly That Tiny Spaceship, right there *points to screenshots*.<br/><br/>    \u2022 A fresh take on the Arcade Shooter Genre. That Tiny Spaceship is so small it can only utilize its main thruster or energy weapons independent of each other.<br/><br/>    \u2022 <strong>Physics Playground </strong>\u2013 Most objects, explosions and ships in TTS are governed by the Unity 3D Physics Engine meaning that things like force, mass and gravity affect how they move. (Yes...yes\u2026 there is no gravity in space, unless your ship is close to a large celestial body but It is more fun this way, trust us).<br/><br/>    \u2022 <strong>360 degree movement</strong> \u2013 That Tiny Spaceship provides pilots with a full 360 degrees of movement to enhance their survival. Using the built in forward thruster and smaller nose jets for turning. Because TTS exists within a physics simulation activating the forward thursters multiple times will increase the amount of torque applied to the ship.<br/><br/>    \u2022 Pilots are able to use positional awareness and the boundaries of the screen to their advantage. Hit the right edge of the screen? Your ship will pop instantly to the otherside of the play-area, defying all of those fancy physics that control the other aspects of the game. It\u2019s like a twin-stick without the second stick.<br/><br/>    \u2022 <strong>Retro Meets Modern </strong>\u2013 Stellar HD resolution backgrops mesh with vector art space-objects and pixel ships alike in a unique space shooter experience that blends what made the space shooters of the 1980s / 1990s so memorable with the modern technology provided by Unity 3D.<br/><br/>    \u2022 <strong>Not Your Average Spacewalk In The Park </strong>\u2013 The exterior of That Tiny Spaceship must be pretty sturdy to withstand interstellar radiation, but in this case we\u2019re talking about the game\u2019s difficulty level. Missions might be short, only 90 \u2013 120 seconds in length, but when a set of asteroids are coming from all directions at hundreds of kilometers per hour, will you be able to survive?<br/> <br/>That Tiny Spaceship might not be a \u201cforever game\u201d but when everything on the screen can and will try to kill you, not even the far reaches of space can keep you safe.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/22113115a6e6373ba94972794897067c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["We Make Small Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["We Make Small Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
