{"id": 592479, "slug": "knight-daye", "name": "Knight & Daye", "name_original": "Knight & Daye", "description": "<p>[Submission for B&amp;W Jam, 2021]</p>\n<p>The Kingdom of Nelda was once run by a loving king, but while you and other knights were out on a mission, the castle was overtaken by the Great Demon Daye. It is now your goal to traverse your way through the castle grounds and reclaim what rightfully belongs to the King!</p>\n<p>Note: The web build seems to be buggy due to issues between Godot, my laptop, etc. I do not recommend it for full play. I have included desktop builds that I recommend using.\u00a0<strong>Linux Version is confirmed to work. The Windows and Mac versions have not been tested, but please feel free to try them. If they work/don't work, please let me know.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note: I\u00a0hope to someday make a game that is a cross between Zelda adventures and a town simulator. This is my attempt at a dungeon of sorts. I plan to improve it and release a DX version (with Color!) in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys - Move</p>\n<p>J/Z/Enter - interact, jump (once you've gotten the ability)</p>\n<p>K/X - swing sword, back, cancel</p>\n<p>L/C - use item</p>\n<p>E/P - switch items (in order)</p>\n<p>Q/O - switch items (in reverse order)</p>\n<p>V/Semicolon - pull up map</p>\n<p>Escsape - pause menu</p>\n<p>CHEAT CODE: Use the + key (Shift + =) to unlock all items and abilities as well as get full ammo &amp; keys. Warning - this cheat also gives you the master key, which you normally need to defeat the boss to get, so if you want to play the game as designed, I recommend not using this cheat code. (This cheat is essentially designed as a way to make the player able to explore the game to see what it includes.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Issues (Before Submission)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. NO FAIL STATE -\u00a0There is no fail state to the game currently. You will NOT die if you run out of health. This is really just a demo so the map and\u00a0difficulty are not well-designed yet. I ran across noticing that it would be hard to beat this game.</p>\n<p>2. SOMEWHAT LONG - the game is difficult and not too well designed for a game jam, so I implemented a cheat code (see controls) that allows you to unlock full ammo and all of the items so that you can explore without any issues.<br/></p>\n<p>3. HIT DETECTION - The sword hit detection is not great as is. There is also no knockback at the time being.</p>\n<p>4. GRAPHICAL/UI issues - the design of the game is not perfect and needs to be improved upon. I'm not too happy with how some of my custom sprites came out and others are obviously borrowed and modified.</p>\n<p>5. AUDIO IMBALANCE - the audio is not well-balanced as is and has some level issues.</p>\n<p>6. MENU ISSUE - There are issues with reloading the game. If you wish to play a second time, you will need to reload the page.\u00a0</p><p>7. HEART PIECES USELESS - Since the kill state is completely useless, I have not activated heart pieces, so the one or two that you will find it chests were completely just for test purposes. I am too lazy to go back and remove them before the deadline.\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE: All of these issues and more will be improved in the DX version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T09:42:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a84/a8454aa64967253f5ba502a71c837620.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["MetaphysicsStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
