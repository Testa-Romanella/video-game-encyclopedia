The biggest problem being that Game maker cant make HTML5 projects work right now...</p>\n<p>Overall though, the game turned out a lot better and was a lot of fun to concept and design, so I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:56:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/351/351d26c5d6fcb38b6f8c6cfb71c17854.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["dragonkie"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
