Put it simply: you\u2019re <strong>betting with yourself</strong> that you\u2019ll succeed with no bonus, or even with a few curses\u2026 or not! (I\u2019m betting on the latter)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway\u2026 let\u2019s suppose you actually make it (unlikely), you\u2019ll still need enough stamina and bravery to <strong>take things with a new angle and attempt speedrunning</strong>!<br/>Know what I mean? Dodging <strong>spikes</strong>, outsmarting <strong>minions</strong>, leap over <strong>sticky tar</strong>, overcome <strong>giant blade traps</strong>, and so on, to finally <strong>beat the creator\u2019s best times</strong>. Just thinking that you might ever achieve this makes me laugh!<br/><br/><br/><br/>I mean, there\u2019s over <strong>50 levels</strong>. Quite a lot of <strong>replayability</strong> too, depending on what you\u2019re going to pick from the shop!<br/>No bragging, but we did manage to make high level speedrunners rage during playtesting.<br/>A few of those even shed some tears\u2026<br/><br/>And if you think you\u2019re done after a single run, we\u2019ve got plenty of other contracts waiting to be signed, with some spicy <strong>new challenges added to all those levels</strong>!<br/><br/>Don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t mind if you\u2019re ready to give up on the very first level.<br/>Just, maybe, don\u2019t mention it to your friends, it is the tutorial after all\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T06:40:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac5/ac507bc566f2619e1b699e21e43f98c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Operating Dwarves"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Operating Dwarves"], "esrb_rating": null}
