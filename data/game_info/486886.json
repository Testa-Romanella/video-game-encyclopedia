(gotta press on the game screen to make keys affect the game)</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Pigsquad Summer Slow Jam Game Jam!<br/></p>\n<p>(however, I totally missed the mark on the theme, oh well maybe next time)</p>\n<p>THE LIGHTNING OVER PEAR ACRE ROAD takes place between two nights plagued by undead dragons, as a farmer helps a knight heal and recover. This is a gameboy game for folks who enjoy exploring little nooks and crannies of big maps, and reading tons of lore. I think it takes about 1-2 hours to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On HTML, there is no save feature, but you can download the ROM and play it on a gameboy emulator (I suggest SAMEBOY), and save your game in the protagonists bedroom. There is a bug that loading a saved game does not load up the music, so I put a record player in the room so you can load it back up :)</p>\n<p>have fun! I have no idea how playable this is, but hopefully its a nice farm to hang out on, once you get through the first night :)</p>\n<p>for more of my games, music,\u00a0 art, and other work, check out my other stuff on ITCHIO.</p>\n<p>PS special thanks to my husband for being the Botanical Consultant for this game, he wrote most of the plant descriptions! You can find his amazing writing (he's an author with a great book coming out in the spring!) at\u00a0https://www.calangus.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:00:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe9/fe9f12815078421693dde05b9f58f184.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ruune"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
