All you have to do is to drive, burn up, knock down, shoot and blast zombies and monsters. And don't forget to have fun, of course! This light and a bit crazy 2D zombie shooter gives you a chance to have a pleasant truck journey along the world after zombie-apocalypse. You'll see deserts, snow covered mountains, woods in the night, industrial areas and demolished cities.<br/>\r\nGameplay is very simple \u2014 just drive your truck, fast or slowly, bounce your vehicle with the help of rocket engine, shoot the vast amount of different monsters and zombies of all types, forms and colours. Eliminate all bosses, save people and, for Gods sake, DON'T SQUASH black cats!!! You can use grenades and air support if needed. You'll be well-paid for zombie destruction (yeah, nothing is in vain)). Don't be greedy, use the money for weapons and up-grades. All the game objects are physical. You can shoot off zombie's arm, leg or head or any other part which you'll find uneccessary. There are lots of awards that can be gained during the game. If you manage to get them all, you'll be given an honorary title \u00aboverlord\u00bb.<br/>\r\nThe weapons differ in penetrating power, fire rate, recharge time, bullet flying speed and clip capacity.<br/>\r\nAs it was mentioned before there is a huge range of monsters and zombies. Some of them are annoyingly merry, some too dumpish, some are ungodly ugly and surrealistic. And some of them resemble someone you know very well....", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8a088123e112c187725a6c96e761a7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 30, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 361, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rumata Lab", "rumata_lab"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dagestan Technology"], "esrb_rating": null}
