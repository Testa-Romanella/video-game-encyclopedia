These ships are small, fast and agile, and extremely dangerous due to the on-board torpedo launchers. But they are also the most vulnerable of all military vessels. More than once in the history of WWII, a handful of those little deadly boats helped decide the course of an entire battle and executed seemingly impossible missions.</p>\n<p>They were called the \"mosquito fleet\" because of their unique combat tactics. Using speed and agility, dodging enemy fire, PT boats approached seemingly giant enemy ships in a fight of David against Goliath, stung them with well aimed torpedo volleys - and immediately withdrew!</p>\n<p>The casualties were immense, but the results often worth these lives and sacrifices. These small heroes of the great war made an unforgettable contribution to the Allied victory.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKey features:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>The game combines key elements of a strategic, tactical and action simulator\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The player can control each crew member separately, or command whole groups of ships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Flexible options allow the player to fully customize the game difficulty\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Military units are recreated using authentic historical documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>All game objects use real-life physics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Beautiful and realistic sea and ambiance effects never seen before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Support of DirectX 10 and multi-core processors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/323/3237b21136b5ca087e067d6f6d161443.jpg", "website": "http://pt-boats.akella.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 17}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Akella"], "esrb_rating": null}
