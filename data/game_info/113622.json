No?... Okay... then you should do it now! Why? Because you need to go out and find the probably last bottle of <strong>\"EpicMilk\"</strong>... You'll need the milk to save the world... because the milk is awesome they say... Only <strong>EpicMilk</strong> will give you the power  to stop this zombie guys forever. Okay and it is very delicious, too (<em>serve chilled</em>). </p><p>This game is still in development, so there are only a few levels and some procedual created music tracks, sounds and comfort functions... if you like to give me some helpful feedback, please contact me on Twitetr (@technokrat)... Or visit my website psychomonster.com :)</p><p>You can also play a very outdated html5-demo version of <strong>The Last Bottle Of Epic Milk</strong> :)</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p><strong>Movement:</strong> <em>Arrow-Keys or digital cross of your gamepad to move</em></p><p><strong>Kick their ass:</strong><em> Space or the a-key on your gamepad</em></p><p><strong>Pause the game:</strong> <em>ESC or start-button on your gamepad</em></p><p><strong>Quit the Game:</strong> <em>Q (only in level mode)</em></p><p>You need to <strong>find 5 apples</strong> to disable the obstacles (the boxes) to gain acces to special areas or to the exit... but be carefull... every eaten apple makes the zombies more agressive... </p><p>Have fun finding the milk... because it is awesome to do so. If you want to buy me a beer or some tasty snacks you can choose a price you wanna pay for this game.
