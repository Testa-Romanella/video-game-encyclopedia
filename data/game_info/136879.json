This game and its currency is based off the Australian Welfare system and their approximate current pay rates.</p>\n<p>Due to it being so impossible in real life, I have made this game equally as difficult (Impossible)... You are meant to lose. In saying this, I don't believe I have tested this thoroughly enough in order to discover if it were actually possible to make it to the end so by all means, give it a shot and let me know if it is!</p><p>If you're interested on my process and experience of development of this game please read my post-mortem blog post:\u00a0https://garyreidgames.com/2017...</p>\n<p>Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86b/86b6f25f37f34138c2b5f22ce136498a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gary Reid"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
