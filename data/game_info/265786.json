Our idea was to build a system that allowed players to craft spells out of runes, in a huge variety of ways.\u00a0You can combine runes of different types and rune modifiers to make spells that kill slimes in a ton of different ways, including but not limited to...</p>\n<ul><li>Burning at the\u00a0stake</li><li>Blizzards</li><li>Chain Reactions</li><li>Necromancy</li></ul>\n<p>We hope you enjoy. We didn't have time to add proper gameplay, but the spell crafting system is there and a testing ground to satisfy your spell-crafting needs. At least a few updates are expected in the future of this project. I like how this mechanic came out and definitely want to spend more time on it.</p>\n<p><strong>Team\u00a0Members:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Julien (DerJulien): Particle Programming</li><li>Jacob the\u00a0Viking: Sprites</li><li>Cloaked\u00a0Games: Programming</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78d01579be9d30db11e520ca89106955.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cloaked Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
