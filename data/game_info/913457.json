IT MADE THE LAND FERTILE AND THE WATER CLEAN. BUT NO ONE WAS EVER ALLOWED TO TOUCH THE CRYSTAL, AS THE LAST PERSON WHO DID OVERCOME BIG MISFORTUNE. THIS TRADITION WENT ON FOR CENTURIES TILL \"THEY\" CAME, WE NEVER KNEW WHAT \"THEY\" WERE OR WHERE \"THEY\" CAME FROM, BUT \"THEY\" CAME WITH BIG BOATS OUT OF THE SKY. AT THE BEGINNING EVERYTHING WAS PEACEFUL, AND WE SHARED\u00a0WHAT WE HAD WITH \"THEM\" TILL \"THEY\" FOUND OUT ABOUT THE BIG CRYSTAL. \"THEY\" GOT GREEDY AND STARTED\u00a0TO LOOSEN THE CRYSTAL, BUT IT EXPLODED, AND HIS CRYSTAL SHARDS GOT SCATTERED ALL\u00a0\u00a0AROUND THE WHOLE VALLEY. AFTER THAT, \"THEY\" GOT VERY ANGRY AND WANTED US TO MAKE A NEW CRYSTAL, BUT AS \"THEY\" SOON FOUND OUT, NO ONE WOULD HELP \"THEM\". AFTER THAT, \"THEY\" WENT BACK IN \"THEIR\" FLYING BOATS AND TOOK MANY OF OUR PEOPLE WITH \"THEM\", THOSE FEW OF US WHO ARE LEFT ARE NOW HIDING IN FEAR.\r\n</p>\n<p>THERE ARE NOT MANY LEFT OF US.\u00a0HELP US \"DEX\".
