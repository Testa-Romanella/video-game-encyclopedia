But no doctor can fight it. The Long Walls did a great work connecting the city with Piraeus. Until that was not enough. First, the victims of combat. Then overcrowding and starvation. Now the Plague controls Athens. Chaos. Those sick fires swallow bodies relentlessly. So many deformed corpses! Not one healthy soul. Not one healthy mind. But, the city cannot die. There must be a solution; some kind of cure. I hope. (For na\u00efve\u00a0rumors of monsters and Plague being... no, of course.) Oh, Xenophile. You did not deserve the torture of the illness. At least your pain is over. I have a while to visit her grave. Cerameikos has become... unpleasant.
