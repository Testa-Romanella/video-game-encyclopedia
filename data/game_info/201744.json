The thrill of travelling at several miles per hour, traversing varied landscapes and reaching exciting destinations... Wait, why is my car a cube?<br/></p>\n<p>Cube Race is a single player car simulation made in late May 2016 in Unreal Engine 4, in wich you encarnate a \"car\" that travels through 3 different levels, each showcasing a new mechanic while having a distinct look and feel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game itself features tight car controls (similar to the ones seen in the Mario Kart Saga), a puzzle with 2 possible outcomes, a boss fight with 3 stages, and partial controller support. Everything is packed together with the wonders of level streaming and a dynamic soundtrack, that changes depending on wich level you're in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Reach the elevator on each stage to move to the next one.
