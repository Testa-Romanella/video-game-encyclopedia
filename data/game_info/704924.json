The theme was Winter.\u00a0This was my first time participating in a game jam and I quickly realized how little you can do in a short amount of time. I'm happy with what this ended up being despite its very short play time.\u00a0I hope you enjoy it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>My creative goal was to make a short creepy story with a holiday theme. My technical goals were to learn the following about Unreal Engine:\u00a0UI, music, sound, modifying animation, and packaging. Let me know if you find any bugs or have issues running this on your computer. I\u00a0know there is more I\u00a0can learn from this project.</p>\n<p>If you feel inclined to toss any coins my way, rest assured they'll be used to fund future games.\r\n</p>\n<p>To follow along and learn about new games, you can find me at:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/geoffa</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T09:32:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e78/e78a14dae50c93b84a358aef105749b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geoff Alday"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
