Survive as best as you can, dodging asteroids using your ship's abilities.</p>\n<p>Shoot green rocks to increase your score multiplier. As it goes up, difficulty will also increase !\u00a0Whenever it gets too tough, you can always pop a magenta rock and blow everything back to normal !</p>\n<p>Try and achieve the best score you can and post it below ! My PB is 27'604.\u00a0If you try this game out, please feel free to share your thoughts, any feedback is welcome.</p>\n<p>Beware, controls are purposely hard and although they may seen counter-intuitive to some people, but you'll get the hang of it!\u00a0Glad to hear your feedback about controls, too.</p>\n<p>This is\u00a0my very first game and was made over a week or so.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<p>- Game objects are supposed to wrap around screen when hitting borders. Sometimes, your ship can disappear and remain stuck out-of-bounds. If you encounter this issue, please tell me how it happened. I reckon it might happen when flying too slow around the screen borders.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Game will not work properly for screens of ratio different than 16:9. I\u00a0haven't bothered handling that issue for now and I apologize.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T14:27:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d93669e01c8c33470ca90134bab5e5d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ol-Sellik"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
