The Great Pit demands trash. You have been given until sundown to collect all this trash. Tomorrow, you will collect more trash. The Great Pit sounds angry.

How much longer can this go on for?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 50 Jam in April of 2022, whose theme was <em>delaying the inevitable</em>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Move with WASD or your arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Pick up and throw with Spacebar, E, or Enter/Return.</p>\n<p>* * * *<br/></p><p><strong>Important note:<br/></strong></p><p>Testing of this game was impacted by a power service outage in the Puget Sound region on the final day of the jam. Though all is fair in Ludum Dare, the decision was made to implement post-release bigfixes in accordance with the rules of Ludum Dare (major bug fixes only; no new content). The bugfixes are as follows:</p><p>* Fixed broken collision in various rooms making certain items unobtainable<br/></p><p>* Fixed certain objective items being invisible<br/></p><p>* Fixed a softlock in a certain room<br/></p><p>* Fixed various sounds not playing/playing at incorrect pitch</p><p>* Music volume is now properly affected by the volume slider<br/></p><p>* Shortcuts now properly function when holding items</p><p>* Depth sorting has been improved<br/></p><p>For the sake of the genuine Ludum Dare experience, the original version will remain available on this webpage as a separate download.
