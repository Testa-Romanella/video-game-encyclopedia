Teaching those new players how to beat you over and over. Well you have had enough now you want to be a real boss. Upgrade your weapons and destroy the new hero. Can you do it?</p>\n<p>Controls -<br/>The number keys 1,2,3,4,5 all activate weapons you can use. 3,4, and 5 all have to be placed on the map first before you can use them.<br/><br/>Game Jam Stuff -<br/>Yes I ran out of time to really polish this game. It was still fun to design and code. I really thought I had enough time to do everything. I got stuck on making the AI somewhat smart for a few days. I hope it's still somewhat fun.
