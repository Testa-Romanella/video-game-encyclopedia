The goal\u00a0was to make a game with a social impact, so after talking it out \u00a0we decided to make our personal experiences the platform to push our topic.<br/><br/>You play as a Project Manager completing projects (woks) before the deadline is up by managing your candles' work life balance.\u00a0The game aims to showcase how impossible demands &amp; bad decisions allow\u00a0crunch to sneak into a game development cycle &amp; the human cost of complying to those terrible choices.<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/><em>- drag and drop the action buttons onto the candles to tell them what to do. They'll keep performing that action, be it work, holiday or crunch until you tell them otherwise.</em><br/><br/>We won the jam! We'll be working to develop this further into something that we can show at LevelUp KL in 3 months, so stay tuned!<br/><br/>*Disclaimer: no candles will be burnt out while we develop this game~*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T15:50:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e33/e33472a8e9bf08bf5711c3b974493af9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JunoStriker", "s34nn", "TheBlitzzz", "RustyParang", "cynthiatan"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
