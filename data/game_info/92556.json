Brilliantly showcased as the soundtrack to an interactive Visual Novel, Aurora Memoria is a 5 song ultra-concept EP full of lush, digitally-quantized bellscapes punctuated by samples, sweeps and FM blips. Set in the neutropic, hyper-evolved megalopolis 'Fuji City,' this interactive Visual Novel-written by Callie Beusman-is an inspired new take on a medium colloquially referred to as the 'dating-sim'.</p>\n<p>Aurora Memoria allows the player character up to five divisive plot courses which wind their way through a multitude of rich CG and vector-illustrated backdrops and character designs complemented by nuanced dialogue and branching plot arc. A concept release to its very core, DV-i's Aurora Memoria material format will be equally as stunning. This interactive release will be loaded onto a 4-gigabyte Secure Digital (SD) card with custom printed decal and housed in a 3d printed, thermoplastic case--this, of course, all designed by DV-i as well. </p>\n<p>\"Aurora Memoria is a comprehensive multimedia exploration of science fiction, japanese anime, corporate audio-logos and the studio ghibli-blue-and-green optimism of a Sony-developed speculative lifestyle. Punctuated by the very real fears of a post-climate change, mass data-culled surveillance society, Aurora Memoria is fused together by a combination of IDM, Japanese Technopop, drum-n-bass and Yamaha digital synths (with a sprinkling of fictionalized teenage angst).\" </p>\n<p>-DV-i</p>\n<p>Aurora Memoria Philosophical Data Session: 2093 will be available throughPrizTats.com September 24th, 2015.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a1/7a11d9674da08b55ef298949cbfe84df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Priz Tats"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
