This ratio partly determines the speed that the bb exits the barrel. When the ratio is too low, the bb will not have enough power to run through the barrel optimally. When the ratio is too, higher than necessary air pressure will apply spin to the bb in a rather random direction.</p>\n<p>This app helps you find the proper cylinder type based on inner barrel length.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:19:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f502de4dbdbfd58adb0ddfc4e26ecf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fingertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
