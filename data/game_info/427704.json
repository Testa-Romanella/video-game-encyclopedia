The captain\u2019s ghost be hauntin\u2019 the crew and wants his treasure back! Can ye last long enough to make it to shore? Or will ye be throwin\u2019 treasure overboard as a ghost?<br/><br/>Paper Pirates is a social deduction game for 1 to 10 players, so bring along your best crew, see who you can trust, and who\u2019ll be going overboard! Everyone connects to the game with an internet-enabled device, so everyone can play! And once you\u2019ve got your crew together you can set sail on your adventure!<br/><br/><h3>Sailing on Stream?</h3>Crew all stranded ashore? We recommend playing Paper Pirates on your favourite streaming service to play with remote players! Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not in the same room; you can use the built-in chat feature. And with audience mode, if you\u2019re streaming for the masses, everyone can jump in and affect how the game plays out!<h3>Who can you trust?! </h3>Every round, the captain will give out orders for their crew. Everyone doing their job gets us closer to shore, but watch out for when something goes wrong; a ghost must be about! And if things are going too well, then what\u2019s to stop the captain being a ghost?<h3>Get Off My Ship!</h3>At the end of each round, you\u2019ll vote for somebody to walk the plank. You want to purge the ghosts, but be careful... every innocent pirate overboard comes back to haunt someone anew!<br/><br/><h3>I\u2019m the Captain Now</h3>When someone goes overboard you could be up for a promotion. The higher your rank, the more likely you are to get haunted and become a target. If you end up as captain, you\u2019ll be the one choosing who gets to take part in each day\u2019s task. Make sure you know who you can trust to get you home!<br/><br/><h3>Packed with Events</h3>Are things going too well? Oops, we\u2019ve hit rocks; a whirlpool has caught us; cue spooky ghostly apparitions! Are we nearly all out of treasure and all hope is lost? Help could come from a message in a bottle; a spy in the crows nest; an exorcism at sea!<br/>Paper Pirates is filled with events to make every journey different!<h3>Custom Pirates</h3>Always pictured yourself with the eyepatch and hook? Get creative with your pirate in the pre-game lobby when getting ready to set sail!<br/><br/><h3>Custom Games</h3>Wanting to mix up your adventure? Customise the game to your liking, starting with more ghosts? More treasure? More events to shake up the action? It could make your journey home plain-sailing, or be a fast-track to the bottom of the ocean!<br/><br/><h3>Hats and Achievements</h3>Fancy the captain\u2019s hat but you\u2019re stuck as the cabin boy? Not to worry, Paper Pirates has over 30 Steam achievements. Each achievement you unlock will earn you a new hat, which can be randomly chosen for your pirate to wear when customising your pirate in the game lobby! !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-21T00:53:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ca/7caca5f7c502e3fbf495fd6220a6523c.jpg", "website": "https://iteration-games.com/digital/paper-pirates", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 58, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iteration Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Iteration Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
