This is a little snippet of a game I am developing. All instructions and rules are in game. I would recommend playing the levels first and free play second. Sorry if free play isn't the best or has a few bugs, I am still a little new to procedural generation. Press escape to return to the main menu, from which you can quit or play the game.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, the windows version triggers windows' antivirus and warns you it doesn't recognise the file or owner and it could be a virus. It is not.
