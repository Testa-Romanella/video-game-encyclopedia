What is your crew thinking? That you'd give up your booty faster than a flapping seagul can steal your sandwhich on deck? Show them who's boss and keep them away from the treasure by shooting them.</p>\n<p>Beware though... Bullets are expensive ! You can always earn more by playing a casual game of memory matching. Heck, with your swashbuckling skills, you got time to spare anyway !</p>\n\n<p>KrassJam 8/8 ;) Enjoy !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d933bf0f0e252cb0870c84ce0c158a09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["JavaSaurus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
