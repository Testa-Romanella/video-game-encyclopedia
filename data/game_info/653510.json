One comes every 3.5 seconds. Place a package in the correct bin, a green light flashes, and you're closer to filling it up (blue light). Once a container is full, no more packages will be spawned for that destination.\u00a0And once you've filled 18 of 30 containers, you've beat the level.\u00a0Storing a package in the wrong location will yield a red light and a score penalty. If not removed,\u00a0it will make your job much more difficult. Careful though because correct packages falling out of a\u00a0full container will mark it as unfull, and constant collisions means you'll have to put more into that\u00a0container. Try to get as high of a score as you can!</p>\n<p>Oh yeah... and every package you miss gets vaporized and counts against your score.</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Calculations</strong>:</p>\n<p>Score is calculated via this equation:</p>\n<p>((Stow Rate - Incorrect Attempts) - (3 * Packages Destroyed)) / 2</p>\n<p>WHERE</p>\n<p>Stow Rate = (Packages Correctly Stowed / Seconds) * 3600\u00a0 \u00a0--- Since this is an hourly rate I get\u00a0pkgs/second and multiply by 3600secs/1hr to get pkgs/hr</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<p>Right Grip - Grab Right</p>\n<p>Right Thumbstick - Teleport</p>\n<p>Left Grip - Grab Left</p>\n<p>Left Thumbstick - Rotate</p>\n<p>Right Trigger - Shoot (Easter Egg)</p>\n<p><strong>**NOTE**</strong>: For some stupid reason Oculus controllers are always shown instead of WMR\u00a0controllers.</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Epic Games:</strong></p>\n<p>VR Pawn and Player Character</p>\n<p>Grabbable Cube used as base for packages</p>\n\n<p><strong>External:</strong></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/frankum/sounds/380823/ - \"Yeah!!!
