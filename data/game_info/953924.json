Ranking highly among these 50 or more characters are pesky dinosaur sidekicks Tricky and Kyte, one a CloudRunner Princess, the other an Earthwalker Prince: these two take an active role in the adventure alongside their respective partners, opening up a whole new set of commands vital to continued success. They can dig holes, uncover secrets, retrieve objects, distract enemies, even play games - just make sure you keep them well-fed or you&#39;ll never hear the last of it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-09T08:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/047/047d1ea0adb7300793f74ec5bdeb727e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
