The game is follow-up to Nintendo&#39;s previous title featuring Griffey, Ken Griffey Jr.&#39;s Winning Run. It was released on May 31, 1998, and allows players to choose any contemporary Major League Baseball franchise and play through an exhibition, a complete season, or a World Series. Players can also choose any player from any team to compete in a Home Run Derby. The player can also select up to four individuals to play as in Home Run Derby. The game also featured all 30 MLB team&#39;s stadiums. The game was seen as a faster, more arcade-like baseball game compared to its rivaling product, the more realistic baseball simulation All-Star Baseball &#39;99. Nintendo released a sequel the following year, called Ken Griffey Jr.&#39;s Slugfest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-24T17:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8bd/8bdc3e0ed28a5d25840e76094bad1c6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Angel Studios"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
