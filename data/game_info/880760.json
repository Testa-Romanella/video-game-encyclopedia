The goal is to either push the other player off of the boat, or to tire them out so much they can no longer move.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Red - Movement with \"WASD\", Jump with \"\\\", and Punch with \"Q\" and \"E\".</p>\n<p>Blue - Movement with \"IJKL\", Jump with \"/\", and Punch with \"U\" and \"O\".</p>\n\n<p>STAMINA:<br/>You both have a stamina meter - it's used up when punching, jumping, and getting hit. It regenerates after you wait a second without using it - but don't take it for granted -\u00a0\u00a0getting hit reduces your maximum stamina PERMANENTLY!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>WEATHER:<br/>Droplets of rain, snow, and tar regularly drop onto this ship. Touch one, and the terrain will get wet - watch out for slipping! It can also become icy, with no friction at all, and tarry, which makes you stick to the floor -\u00a0 try jumping out!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Matthew Lindsay (2115486) - Executive Producer</p>\n<p>Ashley Stanley-Webb (2150699) - Main Gameplay Programmer, Animator</p>\n<p>Brooke Rhodes (2124791) - UI and Gameplay Programmer</p>\n<p>Max Ottesen (2089319) - Lead 2D Artist, Environmental Designer<br/></p>\n<p>Robin Buck (2101182) - Executive 3D\u00a0Modeller</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Attributions:</strong></p>\n<p>- Ragdoll mesh:\u00a0https://github.com/dci05049/Active-Ragdoll-Tutorial-Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T12:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfa/bfaa70b6acabfa2224cc2b2186e309ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brooke", "Otterly_Butterly", "Ashley Stanley-Webb", "up2101182", "UP2115486"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
