Click anywhere to place a tower, which will decrease your health. Click on an existing tower to sacrifice it, and your health will increase by the number of enemies that tower killed. When an enemy reaches the end of a path, you lose health.\u00a0</p><p>Think of this as a very quick TD game. There's a bit of luck required with the RNG for enemy spawns to gain momentum, but the challenge is in managing your towers and sacrificing the most productive ones to regain health.</p>\n<p>If your health drops to zero, game over!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/9795c014f086a5a3b1e2f0efd4a349e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tofunaut"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
