{"id": 951401, "slug": "square-bros-2", "name": "Square Bros", "name_original": "Square Bros", "description": "<p>A 2 Player Game in which you need 16 kills to win.</p>\n<p>Get a friend, because there is no AI or any online multiplayer. If you don't have any friends, first off that is a skill issue, but you really should - they're pretty cool.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Red: Arrow Keys to move, M key as your special</p>\n<p>Blue WASD to move, Q key as your special</p>\n<p>Up + special enters slow motion, which all styles can access.</p>\n<p>There are various special types,\u00a0 and I will walk you through them.</p>\n<p>Quick - can teleport and has a super smash capability. if you tap\u00a0special + right or tap special + left teleports you either left or right. If you teleport through a player, you score a kill. If you hold special + down, you enable super smash, and if you collide into a player when not grounded, you score a kill.<br/></p>\n<p>Bullet - in the name, it shoots bullets. If you tap special + left or special + right, you shoot a bullet. If you hold special + down, after a certain cooldown you have a burst attack shooting bullets from either side. If a bullet touches your opponent, you score a kill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hunter - probably the most unique special out of these. If you hold down + special, you enter bow mode, and you can use the right arrow key to turn your bow clockwise. There is no left arrow aim because for balance reasons and totally not because unity isn't taking the A key input for some reason for this specific powerup. Let go of either the special or down keys, and you launch 3 bullets - the middle one being a lot faster and having a lower gravity scale, giving it more of an arcade launch.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>I made this game because I love how fun 2 player games like Super Smash Bros are. They manage to make something really fun to play. A lot of the inspiration of this game comes from Super Smash Bros. I also used SFXR for sound effects and 8-bit pixel music from the Unity Asset Store.</p>\n<p>It would be greatly appreciated for donations and for bugs/exploits.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T21:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14c/14cb4b03ebd91598e866a0db808b0f92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS"], "developers": ["TheKidBirder"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
