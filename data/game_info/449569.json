I was intrigued by the constrasting opinions surrounding this genre and I\u00a0was interested to create one myself. I feel this module has given me plenty of oppurtunities to better my 3D modelling and texturing skills, while allowing me the get a better and more in depth understanding of what it takes to create a game from start to finish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0am happy with where Love, Chris is at now, considering I\u00a0had four months to conceptualise, plan, develop and design this game. However, I\u00a0would also still consider Love, Chris a work in progress and I welcome feedback to improve it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:38:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c887ebe5bfdadd4491955385e662fd54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shreddingDemon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
