Original was made in just one month for #1GAM October 2015. I worked on the expanded version, off-and-on, for a year.</p>\n<p>The original is local multiplayer only. The expanded version has a passable AI which is automatically inserted into the game if you start with only one player.</p>\n<p>Supports keyboard and XBOX 360 controllers. Other controllers are probably mapped very strangely.  </p>\n<p>See \"attrib.txt\" in the download for credits.
