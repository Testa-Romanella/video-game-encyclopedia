You can set the difficulty to determine where the dogs spawn. <br/></p>\n<p>You can also Set a timed mode to get a 3 minute clock to swab as many dogs as possible!</p>\n<p>General \"About the game\":<br/></p>\n<p>This project was mostly to learn some stuff in the Godot engine, and I do not intend to develop it too much more than this.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about dog coat color genetics so you can tell me I wrote these alleles in wrong, check out http://doggenetics.co.uk/</p>\n<p>Bugs, etc.</p>\n<p>If you click timer mode on, it doesn't seem to feel like turning off. Simply refresh the page and leave that option unchecked to play free play mode (no timer).</p>\n<p>If you are in free play mode, refresh the page to get into the options menu and turn timer on (I apparently didn't code in a back button yet lol)<br/></p>\n<p>Credits!</p>\n<p>Game design, \"art,\" coding, etc. by Zach Lounsberry (@YouCarryOats)<br/></p>\n<p>Music by Dylan Lounsberry (https://dlounsberry.bandcamp.com/)<br/></p>\n<p>Sounds are creative commons 0 from freesound.org or created in https://sfxr.me/<br/></p>\n<p>Game thanks in large part to the Godot community for tutorials and inspiration<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T04:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb8/bb8c7a278d0277636725fcb02847389f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YouCarryOats"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
