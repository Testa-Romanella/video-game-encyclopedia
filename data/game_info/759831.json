{"id": 759831, "slug": "space-fight-jace8bit", "name": "Space Fight (Jace8bit)", "name_original": "Space Fight (Jace8bit)", "description": "<p><strong>Space Fight</strong> is a 2D top-down space themed shooter game where you and your spaceship must fight and survive against oncoming waves of enemy ships that are\u00a0trying to destroy you. Your ship is surrounded by asteroids so you are unable to flee and no other choice but to fight to survive.<br/></p>\r\n- Gameplay -\r\n<p>You can fight back against the attacking enemy ships by shooting at them with your ship's laser-bullet cannon. The cannon can be fired by left-clicking the mouse and if a laser-bullet hits an enemy ship, they will take damage.\u00a0 If you or an enemy loses all of their ship's health, the ship will be destroyed. The goal is to destroy as many enemy ships as possible and avoid being destroyed yourself.</p>\n<p>Your ship has a dash ability which allows you to quickly move around the arena and dodge incoming laser-bullets. The dash ability also allows you to dash through laser-bullets if timed correctly which can be very helpful to avoid taking damage. The dash ability can be activated by pressing the spacebar on your keyboard.</p>\n<p>You can collect heart pickups to replenish your health and you can also find multiple different powerups that will make your ship's offensive abilities more powerful for a limited amount of time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0powerups\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 heart pickup\n<p>There are also multiple different enemy types which appear in different levels throughout the game. The enemy types vary in terms of movement, shooting, and health.</p>\n<p>The enemy ships attack in waves and if you destroy all of the enemy ships in a wave the next wave will appear. Waves are grouped into levels and if you manage to beat all of the waves in a level you will move on to the next level.</p>\r\n- Game modes -\r\n<p>There are two game modes in <strong>SpaceFight:\u00a0</strong><strong>Endless mode</strong> and <strong>Level mode</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Endless mode\u00a0</strong>is a game mode in which you must clear as many levels and waves as possible before being destroyed. This game mode goes on forever and you must survive as long as possible and try to get the highest score you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Level mode</strong> consists of 6 separate levels that increase in difficulty and also appear in Endless mode. You can unlock a level by beating the previous level.</p>\n\n\r\n- Controls -\r\n<p><strong>*NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT*</strong></p>\n<p>- <strong>Movement</strong> is controlled with the <strong>W A S D</strong> keys</p>\n<p>- <strong>Aim</strong> by <strong>moving the mouse</strong> and <strong>shoot</strong> by <strong>left-clicking</strong> (and holding)</p>\n<p>- <strong>Dash</strong> by pressing the <strong>spacebar</strong> (while moving)</p>\n<p>- <strong>Pause</strong> the game by pressing the <strong>ESC</strong> key during gameplay</p>\r\n- Credits -\r\n<p><strong>Game created by Jason Hamidovic</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SFX created using ChipTone</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Art created using Pixelorama</strong></p>\n<p>*Font used in the\u00a0game is called <em>PressStart2P</em>*</p>\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\n<p>This game took me way longer than it should've as I started it over a year ago but I guess it makes sense as I am still learning unity and am quite new to it. I also have not published any games in the past so I am new to game dev in general.\u00a0 With that said, don't judge too hard as this is my first proper game and my first finished unity game as well.</p>\n<p>There is also no music in the game as I am yet to learn how to make my own music for games.</p>\n<p>I probably will not be updating the game as I want to move on to new projects and\u00a0I also have to deal with school but I might update it if I feel like it or if the game has any game-breaking bugs or other issues.</p>\n<p>Anyway, <strong>I hope you enjoy the game!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T13:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f5/7f5aa8d441cbc816851b9973d90bcd75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jace8bit"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
