But what's special about our app is 2 things.</p>\n<p>Firstly, our game can be represented in the real world with Augmented reality, so, if you program a car for example, you can represent the car in the real world, and see it moving with your code.</p>\n<p>Secondly, our game has an special touch in education, so teacher in class, or parents, or the community, will be able to create \"levels\" with objectives, or rooms, to connect with each other and develop in class, or home, different solutions to different problems.</p>\n<p>It also comes with different vision modes. So for example you can activate physics viewmode and you will be able to see the forces that are applying all objects, or you can activate maths viewmode, and see angles of the objects on the scene.</p>\n<p>After gamejam, we are still working on CodeBox, and preparing for future realease.</p>\n<p><strong>Project members (TreePot Team):</strong></p>\n<p><em>Programming:</em></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Marina Chavarria\u00a0\u00a0(Me)</p>\n<p>- Joan Ortiga</p>\n<p><em>Art:</em></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Pol Serra</p>\n<p>- Marc\u00a0Galdo</p>\n<p>-\u00a0J\u00falia Blasco</p>\n<p><em>Design:</em></p>\n<p>- J\u00falia Blasco</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fb/6fb15fe2bae1be6e1159b113b69d82b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LadyMarina"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
