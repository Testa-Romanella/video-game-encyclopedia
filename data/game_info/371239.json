Phew! There were quite a lot! This was the first Game Jam where i needed to make everything by myself. Oh boy, sorry for the sounds!</p>\n<p>I wanted to talk about the Tools:\u00a0Let's start with <em>Unity</em> and <em>C# </em>for the main programming and work. I really love Unity with its endless functionality!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Background (that green one) have i painted with acryl color on canvas, then scanned, put it in <em>Gimp</em> and after that vectorized it with <em>Inkscape</em>. That was the first time i tried this out. The Buttons and Panels are made also like this. Every other art is only made with Inkscape. I really love Inkscape.\u00a0Almost as much us Unity!</p>\n<p>Well, now the sounds. Seems that this was not the best part of my work.\u00a0In my defense: I've never done anything like this before. The background song is made with the unspeakable but wonderful Tool <em>Bosca Ceoil.</em>\u00a0Even I managed to make a song with that Tool,\u00a0that you can listen to for a few minutes.\u00a0The Sounds I recorded with my phone. I used knifes, ruler, paperclips, chips and more for this. Oh, and not to mention: I owe the wonderful burps to my husband (in level 17 you will understand)!\u00a0I edited the sounds with <em>Audacity</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to</strong></p>\n<p>I want to thank the great Youtubers who hosted this Game Jam! Especially thanks to Asbj\u00f8rn (Brackeys), who helped me with his tutorial about Bosca Ceoil, not to make your ears bleed completely.\u00a0And a big thank you to Noa (Blackthornprod), because I love his style and learned how to use particle effects and trails through his tutorials.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A huge big thank you to my husband for his outstanding burps (in level 17 you will understand). He had the idea for the last two levels and helped me with the level creation and testing.\u00a0And he fed me the whole week. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Support me!</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to support me, follow me on Facebook for more information about other games i am developing:\u00a0<strong>Klick -&gt;</strong>\u00a0Tesi Games on Facebook\u00a0<strong>&lt;- Klick</strong></p>\n<p>I have published my first Game for Android!\u00a0Cubie Fall\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another great game jam game that I have developed that is worth a try: Poker Tower Defense</p>\n<p>I will move on with the development of this Game after the Game Jam.\u00a0Soon Sliding Labyrinth and Poker Tower Defense will be available\u00a0for Android and iOS!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every feedback, praise and criticism is welcome!
