Visit one of my teammate's pages at @Waranya.itch.io</p>\n<p>In the game, the player takes on the role of a hero who comes to save the village in the valley from monsters.\u00a0Manage your resources and\u00a0build towers to defeat the incoming waves by killing all enemies before they can reach the village gate. Think of a strategy and face off against the merciless monsters.</p>\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n<p>The player will have limited resources in the beginning so be aware of that because you can't build a tower if you don't have enough required resources.\u00a0You get additional resources each time you kill a monster.\u00a0But some resources are random to get so come up with a good plan before you build a tower.\r\n</p>\n<p>In addition, the player also has two magic skills that\u00a0required no resources. But still has quite a long cooldown time so it should be used when necessary.\r\n</p>\n\n\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nKill enemies and earn resources\r\n<em>Build various towers</em>\r\nThree different Maps\r\n<em>Two magic skills\u00a0</em>\n<em>Three enemy types</em>\n\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS\r\n<p>Defense tower models from @<strong>free-game-assets.itch.io</strong></p>\n\n\n\r\nNOTE\r\n<p>This project is one of my personal projects to practice and improve my\u00a0game development skills.\u00a0This project\u00a0is\u00a0not intended for commercial purposes.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T09:19:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/50357783e8cca43bb8d4e0650a799481.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chaleewt"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
