Lost world.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nis an action RPG where you have the freedom to choose whether to follow the path of truth (breaking the norm) or follow the path of illusion (play it in a conventional way). The game always wants to convince you that this program is real but it will also have algorithms trying to warn you and get you out of this lie but it's up to you (player) to want to choose which side you will follow. As much as we want you to follow the truth, the choice is yours anyway.     \r\n &gt;\r\n &gt;\r\n &gt;\r\n &gt;\r\n &gt;\r\n &gt;\r\nAvailable on 11/06/22.\r\n &gt;\r\n &gt;\r\nkkkk          kkkk\r\nkkkk       kkkk\r\nkkkk    kkkk\r\nkkkk  kkkk\r\nkkkkkk\r\nkkkk  kkkk\r\nkkkk     kkkk\r\nkkkk       kkkk\r\nkkkk         kkkk\r\nkkkk            kkkk\r\nkkkk               kkkk", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T07:12:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce49d6aa3474ce0c56104be052bfca1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erick Peacock"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
