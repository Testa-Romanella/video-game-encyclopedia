{"id": 597722, "slug": "pvp-juicyboot", "name": "PvP (JuicyBoot)", "name_original": "PvP (JuicyBoot)", "description": "<p>PvP, or Profane Vitriolic People, is a tongue-in-cheek look at the world of online gaming, presented as a 2D third person deathmatch shooter.</p>\n<p>Conceived for Trijam, and following the theme of toxicity, PvP attempts to simulate the experience of being disparaged and abused by children on the internet who are much better at videogames than you are.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, owing the to three hour limit for Trijam, PvP is in a state that can barely be called complete. The intended frameworks are in place, with a rudimentary chat system allowing NPCs to lend words o contempt, and also to respond to certain remarks of yours.</p>\n<p>PvP features something roughly analagous to a loadout, allowing you to customise your character and select your trademark weapon before plunging headlong into the clutches of juvenile online delinquency.<br/><br/>Though I'm happy and proud of what was accomplished in (a little over) three hours, PvP is scarcely what can be called a game, and was from the beginning more of along the lines of a thought experiment, though a thoroughly enjoyable one to make.<br/><br/>Many features were not included for time, among which were:<br/><br/>Multiple playmodes. As it stands, the Slagfest mode is not even complete. You can do much of what would be expected from deathmatch play, but no victory condition exists, and the timer will simply keep ticking. Other play modes were never intended to be anything other window dressing.<br/><br/>High gore mode, on the other hand, was intended, but was not gotten to.<br/><br/>The initial plan was to have four separate maps upon which to carry out a functional deathmatch, but time for these, too, was eaten away, largely by fast-unravelling AI.<br/><br/>Anyone wishing to marvel for themselves at this work of software would do well to take a WASD approach, with mouseaim and firing, space to jump, and shift to sprint. A walljump is also available, which proved a lot more difficult with the introduction of mouseaim. WASD, Enter and Escape will guide you through menus, and the tilde key will allow you to chat with your new friends.<br/><br/>A particular treat to look out for is when one of the competitors manages to shoot themselves to death. and then takes to the chat to begin disparaging themselves.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance to anyone who gives PvP a go and I hope, though somewhat doubt, you will enjoy playing it as much as I did making it.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:08:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7c9aa88b2a5277a29bd44269720a6be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JuicyBoot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
