On release, the art style will be different but have a similar feel and the gameplay will be deeper but still uncomplicated.</p>\n<p>Changes from the last demo include:</p>\n<ul><li>a collectible powerup at the end of the level</li><li>slightly changed jumps</li><li>more forgiving fall damage</li><li>a full screen mode (looks a bit weird still; press Alt-Enter to switch to it)</li><li>a better view when scrolling and some fixed scrolling bugs</li><li>the introduction of fall stun-- if you fall too far, but not far enough to be hurt, you'll be stunned for a moment</li></ul>\n<p>Currently I'm looking for feedback on the feel of the controls and movement, suggested gameplay mechanics, and (to a lesser degree) feedback on the visuals and style and suggestions relating to audio. Bug reports and suggested fixes are very appreciated. Please be specific about any problem you have, whether it's a bug or not.</p>\n<p>If you want to help this game look better, please contact me (preferably via comments the first time). I'm willing to pay for art.</p>\n<p>You can choose to walk past stairs or get on them. To get on stairs, use the up or down arrow when at the bottom or top of the stairs. The powerup at the end still applies after dying, enabling a sort of new game+, but it doesn't carry over if you close the game. (The game is pretty short still.)<br/></p>\n<p>Controls can be changed to virtually anything.
