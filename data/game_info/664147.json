The file was found in VHS (Video Home System) format however the information was digitised to the latest and greatest format.\r\n</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t expect someone of your \u201cadvanced age\u201d to understand exactly how to operate these devices so this document will contain a briefing on how to use the device and the information we have already gathered.\r\n</p>\n<p>This CASE file requires a very powerful device to run, the foundation has found a way to connect this DVD to the internet and connect to a machine in the CASE Directive Facility however to correctly connect to the foundation device your facility issued laptop should be able to, however should you wish to use a personal computer please be sure the computer is running at a minimum:\r\n</p>\n<p>An INTEL CORE I5 5200U running at 2.20ghz and the experimental Windows Vista. The built-in graphical processing unit should be more than capable of running the network-based connection. The network connection has a rather large requirement on RAM (Random Access Memory), as opposed to ROM (Read Only Memory). Your computer will require a minimum of 4GB, please be advised, if your computer does not meet these requirements the foundation recommends you use your company issue CASE Directive laptop.</p>\n<p>The information we currently house on this CASE file is as follows:</p>\n<p>The Victim (Alexi Turner) had received the following letter from his friend William:</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIBED COPY:\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Dearest Alexi\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10/18/1981\r\n  </p>\n<p>I am writing to you today in the hopes that we may work together on a final project, as I\u2019m sure you have heard I am suffering from stage 4 Kidney Cancer, I am yet to lose my spirit nor my strength, I believe one final monster hunt episode should be filmed, for the fans.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Lake Mon-Millian in Turner County was reported to have had paranormal activity during its early settlement. the Lake has remained for the most part untouched by humans since the disappearances nearly 200 years ago.\r\n  </p>\n<p>If this letter should find you after my death and I am not able to accompany you I wish for you to record this final episode. As you know this series, I held very close to my heart.\r\n  </p>\n<p>As a thank you for always being by my side I have left money behind for your daughter upon her turning 18. This is for a number of reasons, as you are aware I never managed to get a wife of my own, your little Mary has always felt like a daughter of my own\u2026\r\n  </p>\n<p>I met a girl, her name was Sarah, you may well remember her, she was the nurse that tended to my burns after episode 5. We were going to get married but unfortunately, I have since developed cancer and I wish we had gotten married sooner, but I don\u2019t want to leave her without a husband to raise our child.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Best Wishes\r\n  </p>\n<p>~William</p>\n<p>William was unfortunately deprived of his life due to stage four kidney cancer Alexi had decided to follow through on William\u2019s final request. A map of Mon-Millian lake was included in the letter which can be found below (2.1). the location we found the camera containing the tape has been marked on the map can be found below.</p>\n<p>Monster Hunt was A documentary was an episodic story in which Alexi and William would explore \u2018haunted\u2019 and/or \u2018paranormally charged\u2019 locations, usually turning up no evidence of monsters, two episodes excluded, in which a supposed \u2018spirit\u2019 of some type is seen entering Williams lower left flank before leaving through the lower right flank, severe visual artefacts can be seen on the film as this occurs. In the following episode it documents the repercussions to William from this event.\r\n  </p>\n<p>These repercussions include but are not limited to:\r\n  </p>\n<p>-Severe burns at the entrance and exit points.\r\n  </p>\n<p>-A cough seemingly from cold/flu.\r\n  </p>\n<p>-Trouble breathing.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The entity we are chasing is yet to be named however it claims to be an interpretation of Abaddon, a \u2018Fallen Angel / Demon\u2019 of destruction listed in biblical lore. the validity of these claims seems unlikely as other evidence and depictions of the \u2018Fallen Angel / Demon\u2019 do not align with the appearance of the entity.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The entity is a shadow creature who as mentioned above calls themselves under the name of the Biblical Depiction of Abaddon the destroyer. The Entity claims to be 2 billion years old. There is a chance that assuming what this entity claims are true; it could have been responsible for the theorized extinctions. However, it may have also arisen from the aftermath.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Previous attempts to watch the VHS directly have caused the viewers to \u2018disappear\u2019 however anyone who entered the room while the VHS was playing, they would report different stories playing with a set of four choices.\r\n  </p>\n<p>People who would later watch the Screen would report Text Options with TV Remote buttons with a choice corresponding, it is theorised that in emulating this file in a DVD format that using 1, 2, 3 or 4 should emulate the response, however the choices may be reduced.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When tested anyone attempting to select a choice with the applicable remote the story does not seem to change. The information received from this information has leading the CASE team to an understanding that the missing persons have been uploaded to the VHS.\r\n  </p>\n<p>we are unsure if you will be uploaded, if you do our current theories indicate that completing the trial will release you from the world\u2026 failing to do so may well result in you being trapped.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When the data from the VHS was extracted, the size was 9.4GB, double the size of what a DVD is able to store, how the VHS was able to store this much raw data is unknown. To allow you to view the Video we have had experts modify the video. It is unclear what changes this has made to the story.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When exploring this CASE file please have your basement in use, recording yourself externally, and take notes. The DVD is highly delicate, please be aware that scratching and or damaging the DVD in anyway May cause catastrophic failure to the device.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Good luck Agent, best wishes from the case team.</p>\n\r\nFigure 1.1", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T04:16:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c2/8c2c1b153232118d75140c978fa7b756.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CASE Director M"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
