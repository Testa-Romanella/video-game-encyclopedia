For a Game Jam", "description": "<p>In a cave... is an experimental project I created for the Uniday Jam 2021.</p>\n<p>The object of this little game is to escape from the cave where you have been locked up.\u00a0You will need to find items that will help you there. Use the arrow keys to move.<br/></p>\n<p> The game is very small, and I advanced it as far as I could in the allotted time. Here is what I wish I had time to add:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>A bot which would complicate your life</li><li>A game menu and advanced user interface</li><li>A better sound ambiance</li><li>Some translations (English, French, Portuguese)</li></ul>\n<p>This jam was also a good opportunity to experiment a project with my own tiny game engine, named CompactStar. I created it some time ago as an experiment, to feel the difficulty to create a such engine.
