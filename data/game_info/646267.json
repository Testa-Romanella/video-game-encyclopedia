If they succeed, a battle ensues to allow everyone to leave purgatory.</p><p>Methods of getting ghosts include: a spinner that, if touched, instantly kills you; spikes that fall onto and kill you; elevating platforms that catch you in mid-air, dropping you to your death; and a platform that disappears into the void while you cross it. The reaper can also blind one player for 15 seconds, and if they stop moving too long, they will die. Try not falling off when you're blind.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T10:26:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88a/88ac7b738a4a5f40b0dee2b79ff44427.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ryangarber"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
