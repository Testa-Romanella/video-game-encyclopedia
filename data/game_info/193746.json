Solve the puzzles it sets up to help Shiori reunite with her fellow!</p><p>Well, at least, it was the plan. I couldn't finish because of cringeful errors, mistakes, often being ridiculously unable to do anything, but slowly, I learnt the use of both PhaserJS, Webstorm and GitHub!</p><p>Use arrows to move.</p><p>RULES:</p><p>- bright and less bright floors can change between this two states, you can't walk on the latter.</p><p>- ghost robots are randomly spawned from a visible indicated rune tile.</p><p>- ghost robots draw a trail; any switchable tile they touch are switched.</p><p>- there are red flashing \"buttons\" that randomly change switchable tiles beyond the area they indicate. Maybe you don't get it, but in-game, it easily becomes obvious.</p><p>THE STORY:</p><p>Shiori, the Cybergod, her fellow, the runes depicted in-game and the ghost robots are all part of a bigger universe I'm building constantly. It's quite a serious worldbuilding project and I dedicate this game to share this with you.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about it, visit the following site: http://terminusnation.wikidot.com</p><p>THE THEME:</p><p>Well, \"Shapeshifting\" in this case refers to the map, as it changes constantly, because of the actions you and your enemies can do. as you can see, the implementation is terrible, but as I mentioned, I'm not finished it sadly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Katamori"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
