Slot Shots Pinball Collection Early Access features five tables, with one more table planned to release over the coming months for a total of at least six tables playable in this collection. Also included in the Early Access is a score attack mode- a one minute multiball thriller with increased mission and slot payouts (and each mode has its own separate online leaderboard system)! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSuper Vixel Land - A retro themed pixel/voxel super wide table that has missions on both the upper playfield and a lower playfield that has a revolving wheel!  <br/>\r\nSlot Shots Casino - A fantasy themed casino playground that features a fully functional slot machine, which has a total of ten payouts based on your slot machine roll. This table also has a spinning lucky wheel in the back that grants various different awards based on where the ball drops down the wheel!<br/>\r\nBass Hunter - A fishing themed table that also features its own custom slot machine. In Bass Hunter you will be completing fishing themed missions, such as catching the \"legendary\" fish, while also collecting high scores from activating the slot machine that features different fish and tackle. <br/>\r\nNeon Nights 2 Skylines - A cyberpunk styled purple and blue neon themed table with a pulse pounding synth style soundtrack. <br/>\r\nOutergalactic Aliens - A remake of last year's table with all new LEDs, and the addition of the slot machine. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This title is built on the Unity engine and there is a slight delay while playing if you use BOTH shift keys at the same time to control the flippers. This is a known issue with the Unity engine. We recommend picking ONE shift key on either side and then using another key to control the other flipper such as S/L, CTRL or Tab. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe entire game's soundtrack currently spans close to two hours, not including all of the sound effects and victory/defeat riffs. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures full controller support, mouse / keyboard support, and the Steam online leaderboards to rank your final score for each table. No subscription, monthly fees, or tickets required to enjoy some good ol' fashion pinball. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat do the Steam curators have to say about this title?
