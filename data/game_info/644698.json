When her older sister Sofia leaves in a hurry, Zo\u00e9lie is distraught at the loss of her best friend and storyteller. She goes on a wild journey, climbing to great heights and crossing dangerous waters in order to be reunited with her dearest sister.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne of our key mechanics is Zoe's quilt, Sue\u00f1o. It can transform into multiple items that allow her to explore the world. It also grants her special abilities like distracting animals and using camouflage to hide in plain site. In our world, Sue\u00f1o also reveals secrets such as transforming the local graffiti into maps and hints. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n After studying the local customs and mythology, the Development team chose South America for our setting, specifically the Buenos Aires region. We came up with a ton of concepts, fascinating story ideas, and interesting mechanics. The core idea of the imagination of the child being central to the game was the only constraint we held on to during this process. We learned that family is very important to the people of South America, particularly the bond between siblings, so we included Zo\u00e9lie's sister Sofia as a key character.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T02:41:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb19ea449578237d5ab7b6d154354b02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 507, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Brook", "Amanda Wood", "Anushay Qureshi", "Bernardo Gullo", "Brice Morgan", "Collin Peck", "Courtney Vogel", "Dixon Dubow", "Gabriel Tobias", "Gianna Rockwell", "Holly Owens", "John Washington", "Julia Myers", "Julia Nguyen", "Kellan Dwyer", "Kelly Washington", "Kuan Xue", "Mackenzie Blackgoat", "Maxwell Mecimore", "Megan Tkac", "Mercedes Khumnark", "Michael Mauro", "Mike Relleva", "Nathaniel Cartwright", "Nick Levene", "Oscar Painvin", "Phillip Corrado", "Rachel Howard", "Rodney Burton", "Sanda Gavriliuc", "Santiago Medrano", "Stephanie Owens", "Taan Tuchinda", "Tiffanni Blevins", "Tyler Klimek", "Vincent Aliquo", "Zach St. Amand", "Zachary Taylor", "Gage Leonard", "Cal Eidson", "Sammy Suen"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Savannah College of Art and Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
