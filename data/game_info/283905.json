I made this game with around 20 hours of development time for Shape Jam 2019, a 72 hour jam . It might expand some day  to include things like more levels, more abilities, graphics, and audio, who knows.</p>\n<p>The game supports mouse and keyboard or game pad.<br/></p>\n<p>Some Controls:</p>\n<p>Move - WASD/Arrows or Left Stick</p>\n<p>Shoot - Mouse (Aim + Left Click) or Right Stick</p>\n<p>There's one dungeon with one boss.<br/></p>\n<p>Sometimes a collision error means you're invincible for the rest of the game. If that happens, congrats!</p>\n<p>If it doesn't happen, don't be discouraged by death. Enemies don't heal or respawn when you die, so keep at it and you'll get there.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T05:01:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/058/058db69dd1ebc184971334767aea8973.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Ari_I"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
