The entire station is rapidly losing structural stability.</strong></p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>On a collapsing space station, you must guide a small astronaut through a series of challenging platformer levels to safety. But be careful, and be quick! Each room will only stay stable for 2 seconds. Can you complete all 25 bite-sized challenges?</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the United Game Jam 2020. The theme is TWO, and so this is a platformer where all levels must be completed in two seconds. I am a beginner, working solo, with all art, code, and sound created by me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fonts used:\u00a0Nasalization by Typodermic Fonts (https://www.dafont.com/nasalization.font)</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!
