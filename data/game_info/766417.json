Help protect them from the curse as long as possible!\r\n</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n\r\n<p>The mansion has several guests walking around inside. Sometimes, two guests will decide to talk to each other - this is indicated by a blue bubble surrounding them.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are two <strong>very important</strong>\u00a0sound effects you\u2019ll want to listen for:\r\n</p>\n<p>- When you hear a cackling/laughing sound effect, that means one of the guests has gotten <strong>cursed</strong>. When a guest is cursed, they will wander around and talk to two uncursed guests, and die a few seconds after that. If they die, then they will also spread the curse to the two guests they just talked to (but you can prevent this by curing them, see below).\r\n</p>\n<p>- When you hear a \u201cswoosh\u201d sound effect, that means a cursed guest just talked to an uncursed guest. Use this to help identify which guests are cursed!\r\n</p>\n<p>You can <strong>cure</strong> a cursed guest by clicking on them. If you click on a cursed guest, the curse will be lifted! However, if you click on an uncursed guest, they will die instead.\r\n</p>\n<p>You start out with 3 lives (indicated by the heart symbol), and slowly gain more by successfully curing guests. You lose a life whenever any guest dies, and you lose the game when it reaches 0.\r\n</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, there are 5 guests in the mansion (indicated by the mushroom symbol). More guests gradually arrive as you cure the curse - eventually there will be an overwhelming number of guests and curses, but try to delay the inevitable as long as possible!\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n<p>Created in Unity by Colin Lu, Jon Schneider, and Anderson Wang\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T16:13:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/312/312a092d361481d2a27474fa806de1df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["emanon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
