A rather cinematic platformer, Butterfly&#39;s graphical variation and fast-paced plot will keep you hooked until you finish it.</p>\n<p>The plot revolves around Mobile Infiltration Unit Class 660, codenamed &quot;Butterfly&quot; (hence the name), a top-secret Swiss robot designed to penetrate a secret facility recently discovered in the Egyptian desert. Your mission is to infiltrate the facility and find out why Swiss secret agents have been going missing. The plot moves really quickly - after each small section, and even while you are still trying to complete a certain objective, your Swiss superiors will contact you and update you on your current situation after analyzing your reports. Unfortunately, the plot moves almost too fast; before you know it you will have beaten the game, which takes about two and a half hours to complete.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-16T20:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13a/13aadfb21975cc85be54fa7612fba3a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
