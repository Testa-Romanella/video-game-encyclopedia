Use clouds to cross radar areas safely.<br/></p><p>Unfortunately no sound because of a complete lack of time, and there isn't really art in the game either.</p>\n<p>If I had more time, I'd make the trails clearer rather than changing the cell colours, and tutorialise the cloud and radar bits some more. I think I could have clued in the player that clouds would arrive eventually better as well, as it is you sometimes have to fly around waiting and hoping a cloud will appear.\u00a0</p><p>It's also sad I ran out of time to make more levels with more planes, I'm certain that I haven't run out of things to do with even just two planes.</p><p>I missed the mark on getting bombs into the games. Original intention was to have targets that you had to fly over and destroy before reaching the airports, but I had to cut it due to time constraints. I could imagine some puzzles where you fly over a radar and blow it up, changing the whole level would be pretty cool. Maybe at some point I could have even introduced moving radars, which would have been a pretty evil thing to do to players, especially since there isn't any implied motion from state to state.</p><p>Oh well, fun little puzzle experiment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:16:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b3a4723e45796991d63bdaaf460e143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wellwick"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
