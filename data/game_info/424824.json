Because you are a friend, I can confess about it this way, but you know, if you'd interviewed me just like all the other interviews by people who are like, 'what is a transgender?' I would have had to lie.\"</em>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Explanation\r\n        <p>This is a series of works that came out of a residency carried out in early 2018 in Tokyo, with the Creator Ikusei project, which is supported by the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs. I adopted research techniques from ethnography and history, such as open-ended interviews and participant observation, and developed a method of representing the results of this research in a playful and interactive form that draws heavily from familiar interaction design patterns such as the tamagotchi-style virtual pet and role-playing game multiple-choice dialogue systems.</p>\n<p>Some of the development was funded by Making Ways, Sheffield City of Makers.</p>\n<p>All of these pieces are made in Pico-8, a simulation of a 1980s computer that never actually existed..</p>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Exhibitions\r\n                                                \r\n<ul>\n<li>Futurecade, Festival of the Mind, Sheffield: 20th - 27th September, 2018 | <em>With Sheffield University</em></li>\n<li>Mozilla Festival, London: 26th - 18th October, 2018</li>\n<li>Rainbow Arcade, Schwules Museum, Berlin: 14th December, 2018 - 13th May, 2019</li>\n<li>Solo exhibition, ROAR, Rotherham: 13th January - 8th February, 2019</li>\n<li>Now Play This, London: 6th-14th April</li>\n<li>Docfest, Sheffield: 6th-11th June</li>\n<li>Freelands Artist Programme Work in Progress show, Site Gallery, Sheffield: August 2019</li>\n<li>SQIFF, Glasgow: October 2019</li>\n</ul>\r\n\r\n      \r\n        Installation: Interactive Portrait Cushions\r\n                \r\n        <p>In late 2018, an innovative new installation was created with funding from Arts Council England, using textiles by Anne Smithies and custom-made handheld consoles based on the Adafruit PiGRRL Zero. This creates an intimate space and a tactile engagement with the material, encouraging a sense of proximity to the material. The extensive use of textiles also encourages participation by people who might feel turned-off by the signifiers of videogames culture, creating a sense of a traditional domestic material culture colliding with avant-garde digital aesthetics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e7aa27c0224b9053937ed9929c5a0f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zoyander Street"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
