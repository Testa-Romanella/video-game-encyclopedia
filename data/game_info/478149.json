Drop in the wild western saloon and show everyone that you are the best shooter out there.</p>\n<p>Defend and rewind a Jukebox that will play a rythmic melody while you blast your revolver but keep in mind that the sheriff hears every sound when the jukebox stops. And the barkeeper wont let you demolish his pub aswell.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Can you keep the jukebox alive and defeat the barkeeper and his evil companion?</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 IMPORTANT</p>\n<p>To start the jukebox you have to stand next to it and press E. The level will start and when you finish it you can rewind the jukebox by pressing E to start the next level. Enemys will drop cassettes (I know that's not how a jukebox works xD) that you have to pick up to keep the music on and playing. ENJOY</p>\n\n<p>This project is still WIP. Sounds are missing and some UI elements aswell. If you spot any bugs or other game breaking things please feel free to contact me so I can fix them :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T05:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/591/59153c55cb0df216035eac88bb66abe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kunden_Dienst"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
