You will have \r\nto find worlds that are able to support to life or close enough for life\r\n to grow.</p>\n<p>You can <strong>gather resources</strong> to improve your space ship, your resource \r\nextraction tools and build many objects to <strong>terraform a planet</strong>.</p>\n<p>A <strong>laboratory</strong> is available to the player to make it able to <strong>create or \r\nevolve life forms</strong> to make them survive on specific conditions. You can \r\nsave life in the form of samples that <strong>can be used on a planet</strong>. Life \r\nforms evolved in the laboratory can survive and develop where naturally \r\nthere can be no life (too hot, too cold, too much radiation\u2026).</p>\n<p>There are two game modes, <strong>the sandbox mode</strong>, allowing the player to \r\nhave complete freedom of action, and the <strong>history mode</strong> that adds \r\ndifficulty to the game with the management of resources, the ship and \r\nmuch more. The history mode will offer to the player a complex and \r\nintriguing history that combines exploration, discoveries and puzzles.</p>\n<p><strong>The game can be modified</strong> <strong>with mods</strong> to add different forms of life, modify the galaxy, star systems and much more! \r\n</p>\n<p>The game is in <strong>English </strong>or <strong>French </strong>but can be easily translated into any languages and will be with updates.</p>\n<p><strong>The game is in early access</strong>,\r\n it's mean bugs, missing features and pictures. Your save can be lost \r\nsometimes with updates. I'm working alone on this project since two \r\nyears, community's feedbacks will be used to improve the gameplay and \r\nthe game itself. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Forum:<br/>http://agodsjob.forumactif.com</p>\n<p>Our Facebook page: \r\n<br/>https://www.facebook.com/agodsjob/\r\n</p>\n<p>And our YouTube channel:\r\n<br/>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgl1PaBbgTo5hHjyoKfRoaQ\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>MINIMUM SPECS :\r\n</strong><br/>EXPLOITATION SYSTEM : Windows 32/64bits ( Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8 / Windows 8.1 / Windows 10 )\r\n<br/>PROCESSOR : Need some tests but 1.5 Ghz or better \r\n<br/>RAM : 1 GB<br/>\r\nGRAPHIC CARD: Any</p>\n<p><strong>RECOMMANDED SPECS :\r\n</strong><br/>EXPLOITATION SYSTEM : Windows 32/64bits ( Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8 / Windows 8.1 / Windows 10 )<br/>PROCESSOR : 2.0 Ghz or better\r\n<br/>\r\nRAM : 2 GB\r\n<br/>GRAPHIC CARD : Any</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a31/a317bbfe88f879bf416b6df4e0b4ed00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GregoryGentilhomme"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
