The theme was <strong>\"Running out of Space\"</strong>.\u00a0 The walruses will eat the ice if you don't feed them, thus you run out of space on the ice!</p>\n<p>It was also created for\u00a0<strong>LOWREZJAM 2018</strong>. It was made with a resolution of 64x64 pixels!</p>\n<p>It was also created for <strong>A GAME BY ITS COVER 2018,</strong> a jam using the Famicase Exhibition as inspiration! I made my game based on this cover by Shiratama. The optional theme was\u00a0<strong>CHILL</strong>, which my game fit perfectly with.</p>\n<p>GRIPES:\u00a0 I am overall pretty happy with this game.\u00a0 I think it could use more balance, I'm not really sure if it's too easy or too hard.\u00a0 I was going to add a mechanic to add ice back to the playing field, but ran out of time.\u00a0 I also added music and sound to this game, which I usually neglect, I'm not really happy with the sound, and I would like to learn how to make better music/sound in the next jam.\u00a0 Lastly, my code is a mess, please don't look at it. :)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ce/1ce0aea364463090f80bbec96d413673.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lonewookie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
