Slip and you'll fall into a nice big puddle of, well, water.</p>\n<p>The Volcanic Outskirts:</p>\n<p>Near the volcano there's plenty of cooling lava to take a bath in, but don't: it deals two damage.</p>\n<p>The Volcano:</p>\n<p>It's burning hot here in the volcano. Definitely do NOT take a\u00a0bath in this! It will kill you if you touch it! Why did Sphere Man have to hide in such a scorching hot place?!</p>\n<p>The Sky:</p>\n<p>The final world in The Adventures of Cuby. Here you save captured cubes before Sphere Man comes and smashes you while riding a cloud. How did you get here?
