The game objective is to achieve the highest score possible whilst ensuring that your fuel meter (Green UI Slider under score) remains sufficient for your plane character to continue flying, otherwise a crash animation will occur. The inspiration for this game originated from my belief of being able to attain anything you put your mind towards achieving, which is conveyed through DSN's slogan \"The Sky Is The Limit\". I hope through this game users will embrace my intended concept conveyed, exploring their interests, spending time on their passions and practising self-development in all aspects of their lives to improve their current skills. This project was created for my final year university assignment in Expressive Game Design.</p>\n<p>Buttons:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys (Left, Right, Up, Down) to move plane in-game &amp; keyboard letter E to change the plane's camera view.</p>\n<p>Game Play Video:</p>\n<p>https://www.loom.com/share/95efa44e10c84a5897a2461d2ef76579<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ee/0ee56385c7c74da6bc0d50bbac38d100.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TrisBurton"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
