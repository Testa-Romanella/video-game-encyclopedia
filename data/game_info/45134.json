At the beginning of the game, he gets into a car accident. Outside, it's a cold winter, so there's simply no time to wait for help. Clancy is in danger of freezing to death.<br/><br/>Near the forest, he discovers a strange building, similar to some kind of scientific complex. Soon, Clancy realizes that this is the beginning of his most terrible nightmare. Can you go through all this and not go insane?<br/><br/><strong>Game features:</strong><br/><ul><li> Unusual style of environment. The game itself is made with the mechanics of shooters of the early 90's, but it contains photorealistic graphics.<br/></li><li> Do not go crazy. The main character behind the health indicator still has an index of reason. The harder Clancy panics, the harder will be the hallucinations that he sees.<br/></li><li> Varied gameplay. You will have to look for warm places, not to freeze to death, follow the reasoning and be extremely careful in solving some puzzles.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/122/1220462ca445158548c6dcec04fcb88b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 27}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crystal Box Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AYE Technology"], "esrb_rating": null}
