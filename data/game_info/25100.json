Once Popo reaches the top<br />\nlevel, he enters a fast-moving bonus stage in which he can pick up<br />\nveggies and, hopefully, reach the summit for a big point payoff. Of<br />\ncourse, not everyone&#39;s supportive of Popo&#39;s pastime. Toppies fill Popo&#39;s<br />\nholes, so players must jump through the gaps quickly. It&#39;s easy to slip<br />\noff some of the icy levels, as Polar Bears, Toppies, and other ferocious<br />\nfauna don&#39;t want players up there. There are 32 challenging peaks to<br />\nscale. How will you fare?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-05T04:49:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f55/f55460810c3453867f0d60c92d7c0545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.85, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 54, "beaten": 69, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 81, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 101, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 103, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS", "Wii U", "Nintendo Switch", "Wii", "Game Boy Advance", "NES"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
