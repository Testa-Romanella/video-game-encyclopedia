Do you lust for the courtly intrigues, the murderous realpolitik of ancient nobility, that deadliest of social games which is as coldly intellectual as chess, as savagely physical as a swordfight?</p>\n<p>\r\n That\u2019s what Nine Princes is about.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\r\n Players take on the role of one of the eponymous princes (a genderless term in the setting\u2019s world). The Onyx Throne of their sire rests empty and their birthright empire teeters uneasily on the brink of war. A loose coalition of advisors and bureaucrats have kept the peace, but it is fragile and doomed unless an unquestionable monarchy is restored.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\r\n Rivals and siblings, family and foes, the Nine Princes must decide by argument, deed or conquest who alone is worthy of the crown.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong><em>An OSR hot-take by way of\u00a0the Amber Diceless RPG</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T17:02:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/377/377b6d1272809eff27cc91ac743ce43e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joel T.
