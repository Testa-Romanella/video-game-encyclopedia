Guide the two unlikely friends through ponds to get to the ocean\u2014freshwater is no place for Squiggles the octopus! The tadpole might not be much help at first, but progressing and growing from the experience might see you to the end of the game\u2026 Good luck!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game ended up having to be somewhat experimental in nature; emulating a squishy octopus in a rigid body physics engine was a bit difficult! It\u2019s not entirely bug free when it comes to said cephalopod, but it was fun and worth trying.<br/></p>\n<p>We also didn't have time for sound effects, unfortunately, but there is some nicely atmospheric music! c:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fd15a7b3bd1005a0493f5b3e1e36d70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prinsessa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
