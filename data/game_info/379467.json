{"id": 379467, "slug": "airport-contraband", "name": "Airport Contraband", "name_original": "Airport Contraband", "description": "Airport Contraband gives you the opportunity to see the business end from the point of view of security personal working on airports. You will assume different roles and try your hand at keeping the airport safe, perform checks, look for contraband, spot suspicious passengers or inspect entire aircrafts.<br />\nChecking passwords sounds like an easy enough job, but it actually becomes difficult the moment suspicion arises. While you pay attention to clues in a passenger\u2019s behavior and are aided by a system feeding you additional information about previous offenses, you can\u2019t just pull a passenger to the side on a whim. Well, you can, but every time you are wrong and an innocent passenger misses a flight you get a penalty. Do it frequently and your career will slowly go down the drain. On the other hand if you miss a guilty passenger that is up to no good, your career ends even faster.<br />\n[ CONTRABAND ]<br />\nPreventing the wrong people from getting onto a plane is one thing, but allowing prohibited items to pass won\u2019t help your career either. Discover just how innovate people can get when they try to smuggle things. Upholding not only safety regulations, but also customs laws creates an in-depth gameplay element with a variety of tools and equipment to utilize. It\u2019s not only what some passengers try to smuggle, but also how they try to do that adds an entertaining component into the mix.<br />\n[ MONITORING ]<br />\nPassengers queueing up for departure or arriving is not all that happens around an airport. There is a lot more to maintaining airport-wide security. And it all starts with monitoring different areas of the airport, looking for what\u2019s going on, trying to spot known suspects and mark all types of suspicious behaviors for your colleagues to follow up upon.<br />\nHaving a multitude of cameras and a dozen screens at your disposal allows you get to oversee the vast expanse of the airport.<br />\n[ TIME PRESSURE ]<br />\nMany of the tasks you\u2019ll have to perform might appear quite easy at first. Don\u2019t let this appearance fool you. Even the simplest of tasks might become challenging when time matters and it usually does. On an airport everything is on a tight schedule. You will have to perform your duties with predefined timeframes in mind, otherwise you not only miss out on commendations, but are likely to gather penalties that will hamper your progress and career.<br />\n[ VARIETY ]<br />\nCommercial airline passengers are one thing, private planes are a whole different story. One that you get to experience in detail. Inspecting an entire plane takes the cat and mouse game of smuggling to a whole new level. A small private propeller plane offers plenty of places to hide things and it doesn\u2019t get any easier with a private jet. Thankfully you will have an impressive array of tools at your disposal to aid you in these efforts.<br />\n[ CRIME ]<br />\nContraband is by far not the only crime committed on airports. You will also have to deal with lots of minor violations, theft, impersonation, vandalism or assault to just name a few.<br />\nYour job won\u2019t be chasing criminals (although that might actually happen on occasion), it\u2019s more about discovering those crimes and coordinating the security personal to enact your orders.</p>\n<p>[ WORKING TOGETHER ]<br />\nYou don\u2019t always work on your own. As various tasks have to be dealt with quickly, you are occasionally aided by NPCs. They have different skill and experience levels and also feature different personalities. Who you get to work with depends mostly on your reputation and progress in the game. Some you will get along just fine, others might be a little more tricky not to mention some might even break under the pressure.<br />\nIf you have a rather poor track record, the experienced NPCs will do their best to avoid teaming up with you. However, when you excel at your duties and gain some commendations, you\u2019ll be able to influence who you team up with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2020-09-15T14:28:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b08/b0876b2dde617705306814d4ea819c3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drago Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Movie Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
