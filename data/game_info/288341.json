I recommend starting the game, clicking through until you get to the screen with the timer, and then waiting until the background and all the floating images show up. Once they're loaded, refresh the page  so they load immediately from your browser cache.<strong> <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions<br/></strong><em>Playing for real requires stereo headphones that let one person listen to each side.</em><br/><br/>- The left channel repeats the name of an alien spaceship part. The      player's job is to repeat the part's name out loud so their teammate      knows what they're looking for. <br/><br/>- The right channel says the name of each part when you mouse over it.      The player's job is to find and click the part that matches what their      teammate is saying. <br/><br/>- Get all 6 before time runs out to win!<br/><strong>Team Neila Scinahcem</strong><br/>Blake Balick-Schreiber<br/>Kira Boettcher<br/>Ryan Giglio<br/>Corey Jeffers<br/>Steven Xia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:14:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/188/1883f393340226ed0fb80895a315582e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryan Giglio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
