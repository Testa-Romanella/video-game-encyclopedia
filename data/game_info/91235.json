Playing more than one ending helps you understand what's going on (specifically\u00a0ending 1, 3 and 5). There's a bit of blood and gore(?), mostly censured, but I rated it R-18 just to be sure.</p>\n<p>If you want to help me improve, <strong><em>RATE THE GAME</em></strong> or leave a <strong><em>COMMENT</em></strong>  below to let me know your thoughts - or if you encountered some errors, typos, bugs and what-not: I'd <strong><em>greatly </em></strong>appreciate it :)</p>\n<p>Also, please note that <strong>I've only tested the Pc version</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Twitter: @schivafrecce</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e3/8e38cce35387d11a1d31a366ec03e567.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["schivafrecce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
