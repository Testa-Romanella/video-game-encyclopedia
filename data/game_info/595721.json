You venture in those ruins looking for particular specimens, determined to collect them despite the traps all around the place. \ud83d\udc80</p>\n<p>As an armadillo, roll around the sublevels of the ruins to find what you're looking for and\u00a0stomp the ground to break through it! \ud83d\udca5</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\nMove around\r\n<p>Roll around the level while avoiding spikes and falling boulders. Roll on an insect to take it, and stomp on cracks to access lower levels.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nCollect specific insects\r\n<p>Each time you launch the game, you have a set of 4 insects to collect to complete your collection. The game is won when you have found all 4 insects!\u00a0</p>\r\nHeal with any insect\r\n<p>Along the way, you might find other insects not required by your collection. Insects also replenish your lives, so it's not entirely useless to collect an insect even though it's not part of the collection, just to heal back up.</p>\n\r\nTeam\r\n<p><strong><em>Archeodillo\u00a0</em>was made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 48 by a core team of 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 Guilhem Pech</strong> - Programming (big load)</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 Alexandre Charvin</strong> - Art and Animations</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong> Chiara Rosmarino</strong> - Game &amp; Level Design, Art</p>\n<p><strong> Simon Gigant</strong> - Composition, Sound Design, Logo Art</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Charline Faure </strong>- Key Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/581/581c5a018066cbca3f438fc06b051d1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarylWinters", "Alexandre_VS", "Graouh", "Rambar", "Simon Gigant"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
