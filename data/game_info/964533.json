The local distillery's whiskey has turned into a glowing poison, and the townspeople have caught glimpses of strange figures in the surroundings. Investigate the case and uncover the origin of these peculiar phenomena!<h3>DESIGN AND FEATURES</h3>The style and features resemble adventure games and role-playing games from the early 1990s. The main focus of the game is solving a mystery, but players will also face enemies in turn-based battles. You control only one main character, but during the game, you will encounter helpful characters who can join in the investigations and aid in overcoming enemies. The game is quite short, but the player's playstyle and choices will affect how the story ends.<br/><br/>This game is intended to be played with a gamepad or keyboard, but a mouse is also an option.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-07T02:33:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a0/8a087e7ce943067f45702f009cab4740.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["wilpuriarts"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["wilpuriarts"], "esrb_rating": null}
