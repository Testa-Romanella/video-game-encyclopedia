It is the first title in the series, followed by Knack II, released 4 years afterward. The game was fancied to be a new generation Crash Bandicoot, it released simultaneously with the PS4 console and was provided bundled in some regions. <br />\nGameplay centers around its self-titled protagonist whose primary ability is to disintegrate into little pieces called Relics and absorb various materials to be its parts. Thus Knack may turn into ice- iron- and crystal Knack getting bigger and smaller depending on the number of respectable materials within him. Other than that Knack is a usual beat them up: the player will be dodging, jumping, punching and kicking enemies in various fashions. <br />\nThe game tells a story of a high-end world populated with advanced humans who have discovered the powers of Relics to compose Knack-like creatures and goblins who are presented as a lower race continually trying to start a war or rob humans.</p>", "metacritic": 54, "released": "2013-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T18:51:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/99d/99dddca3736b9fbcfa7630054de24a5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.1, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 69, "owned": 1508, "beaten": 227, "toplay": 20, "dropped": 172, "playing": 15}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 204, "ratings_count": 458, "suggestions_count": 432, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 461, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
