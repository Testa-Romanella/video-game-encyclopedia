{"id": 371176, "slug": "troll-dungeon", "name": "Troll Dungeon", "name_original": "Troll Dungeon", "description": "<p>Welcome to Troll Dungeon! My entry for the Community Game Jam 2019!</p>\n<p>Troll Dungeon is a text adventure heavily inspired in Reventure that tells the story of the player trying to escape from a big dungeon, but beware, the dungeon wants to troll you in every way possible. Can you get all of the endings?</p>\n<p>Troll Dungeon is also the first game i've ever made, and my first finished game jam entry. I used Twine as my game engine of choice to make this game, because i was really lacking game making skills. 5 minutes after\u00a0the theme was announced, i quickly came up with the idea for a Reventure-inspired text adventure. I wanted to add a few images and SFX to the game, but due to time restraints, that wasn't possible. Also, i'm not that good at making games under a specified theme, so i tried following the theme of this jam\u00a0(The game is a liar) as close as i could.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>-A dark dungeon you must escape from.</p>\n<p>-5000+ words worth of text.</p>\n<p>-20+ endings. (Including a true(?) ending.)</p>\n<p>I'm planning on expanding the game after the jam ends, and will feature some more endings, sounds and images.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you like it. ;D\u00a0 And any kind of feedback is greatly appreciated! I will try to improve my game making skills! Also, if you any typos or bugs, please let me know in the comments below!\u00a0Thanks for your attention! ;D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:40:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4d/c4d6bd685def04e822f309af6da74643.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AAA Rhythmics"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
