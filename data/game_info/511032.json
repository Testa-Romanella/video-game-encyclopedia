This is Lunar Monster, a survival spacial game where you have to think about where to go in order to prevent the interdimensinal lunar monster from killing you as you run through an spacial station fixing some modules.</p>\n<p>See the interactible tutorial in the main menu for specific details about the main goal and the controls.</p>\n<p>I'm aware that it's possible to get stuck by the colliders if you run down a lift and sometimes the lift buttons bellow the actual lift get to be a little clumsy, my apologies.</p>\n<p>As for the playgorund each time you reload the game you'll get a random arrangement of level, all with the same goals and perspectives. I wish I could've made that part to be procedurally generated, but time ran out.</p>\n<p>Note: I highly recommend to play it on full screen or download it for Windows for an even better experience.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T06:13:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42a/42acd1c4d3c9c710258af40be1ea6b81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["spiderhead20"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
