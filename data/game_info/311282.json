We used Aseprite as graphics editor, fits perfectly our needs.</p>\n<p>Music are made from GarageBand, and sound FX with BFXR and audacity, and some others with GarageBand also.</p>\n<p>The dev team are from age 7 to 13, they mostly did everything on their own under my supervision. I think they did great for a first C# Project, 3 hours a week every week for almost 6 month, not so bad.</p>\n<p>Game is still in development, it needs some updates, no options at all ATM, and we skipped a lot of functionality to have a preview release.</p>\n<p>Give us your reviews, it will be cool.</p>\n<p>Thanks ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000778cc74d692985f7096635c313c70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LilKidsSchool"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
