As Said Before Gulman 1 Is Not Available On US Computers As Its For Some Reason Fucked So Bare With Me You Dont Wanna Play That Game....</p>\n<p>(NOTE I AM NOT THE GAME'S DEVELOPER OR OWNER I HAVE REUPLOADED THIS FOR SOME PEOPLES PLEASURE ALSO I DO NOT GET PAID FOR THIS AS I AM NOT A SCUMBAG!)</p>\r\nSo how do you start the game?\r\n<p>You've downloaded and unzipped the game and launched Gulman3.exe or XPGulman3.exe (for Windows XP). A black window appears and instantly disappears? This means that the default settings are not suitable for your system. We need to change them! The settings are stored in the file Engine.xml. How do you find it?\r\n</p>\n<p>On Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\USER\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\gulman.ru\\Gulman 3\\Engine.xml\r\n</p>\n<p>On other systems: C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Local\\gulman.ru\\Gulman 3\\Engine.xml\r\n</p>\n<p>Feel free to change these settings inside the file and try to run the game. But the easiest way is to start the ready-made template (BAT) files from the root folder: QualityLow, QualityMedium, QualityHigh_DX11, QualityUltra_DX11. This will enable low, medium, high and ultra game settings. The latter two will use DirectX 11 instead of DirectX 9.\r\n</p>\n<p>LINKS</p>\n<ul><li>www.gulman.ru\u00a0\u2014 Official Website of Svyatoslav Gulyaev\r\n</li><li>Brotherhood of Gulman\u00a0\u2014 Join the Brotherhood of Gulmen!
