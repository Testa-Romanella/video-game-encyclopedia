I didn't know much about how that stuff worked, so my code was mostly copy paste and guess work. Ended up with this strange buggy simulation system in the middle of my journey. Decided to upload it here for easy access!</p>\n<p>Video of the application in use, showing how the simulation can take several minutes between when you input fluid and when the glitch starts:</p>\n<p>In the video, I start by adding some fluid with my mouse. It spreads and it looks like it stabilizes, but then suddenly after about 3 minutes, a weird pattern appears from seemingly nowhere and invades the smooth area. It takes completely over and eventually converges into some vertical animated vein-like shapes. You can see the veins from time to time split up and merge with other veins.<br/></p>\n<p>The main code for the simulation is pretty short:\u00a0https://github.com/asbjornlystrup/glitchy-fluid-simulation/blob/master/GlitchyFluidSimulation.gmx/shaders/sh_cml_rgb_displacement_update.shader<br/>It's a GLSL ES shader that updates a texture with velocity and density information\u00a0each time it renders.\u00a0It takes the\u00a0previous step's texture and calculates the\u00a0new one. The texture is a 720x720 px texture with an RGBA 8-bit format.\u00a0The texture initializes with 0 density (z-component) and (128, 128) for velocity, which is equal to (0, 0) after being\u00a0transformed in the shader.
