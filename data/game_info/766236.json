As an independent journalist, the player travels to the far reaches of a Russian country to solve a tangled murder and uncover the nature of human vices. <br />\nIt bore\u00a0from the idea of what would happen if the events of series like True Detective and The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair took place in Russia. A small town with an interweaving of destinies and secrets of its inhabitants. An established course of their life and a dislike for strangers. Gloomy oppressive atmosphere. Events that seem inexplicable to an outside observer, suggestive of their mystical origin. Sounds familiar, huh? Many of us have seen all this in European and American works in Stephen King&#39;s manner. In many books, films and series. Now imagine the same thing, but in the Russian outback. With its decline, absurdity, remnants of the traditions of the country of unfulfilled dreams and the famous Russian melancholy. Have you imagined?<br />\nWelcome to By-place.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2023-03-29T20:59:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cde3f11452901223b22c13c1cc0a7231.jpg", "website": "https://byplacegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Evgeny", "AkihiroF", "MagicalWesker", "ChainedOhio79", "The3rd Disciple", "darkopus65"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
