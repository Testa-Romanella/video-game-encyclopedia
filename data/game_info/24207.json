Each ingredient is located on a different platform, and \n      you must climb a series of ladders in order to reach them all. Walk \n      across the ingredient to drop it closer to the waiting plate below. Once \n      all the burgers have been completed, you\u2019ll be able to move on to the \n      next level. Use pinches of pepper to stun Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Egg and Mr. \n      Pickle. You can also lure them onto or under burger buns, lettuce, \n      cheese or tomatoes to escape their clutches! Making perfect burgers gets \n      progressively tougher through the six screens of BurgerTime. It\u2019s the \n      ultimate kitchen confrontation!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
