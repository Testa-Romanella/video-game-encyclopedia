We should have years until this star reaches anywhere near this level of decay. It's simply not possible. There's no way it could have gone from years to minutes. This has to be some kind of sick joke. Ha ha! Very funny guys. Now give me my real numbers. \u2026 Guys?\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Item 2\r\n<ul><li>What's the point of even trying? It's all over anyway. I don't know why everyone's bothering with their measurements and calculations. We all know it's not going to matter soon. Why even bother?\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Item 3\r\n<ul><li>I'm running through everything again. And again. What did we miss? When did it first appear? I keep combing our data as though I'm going to get some answer. I don't think there's an answer here anymore.\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Item 4\r\n<ul><li>Every time I turn my head it feels like there's something just out of my view. I feel like I'm being watched. The edges of my vision are blurry and there are shapes I just can't grasp\u2026\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Item 5\r\n<ul><li>I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm sorry. We did something, didn't we? This is our fault somehow. We started this process. Sped it up? I don't even know anymore. Funny how in the end, we really do know nothing again.\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Item 6\r\n<ul><li>We don't have much time anyway. I'm just going to go lie down and wait for it all to be over. No one\u2019s coming to help. We can't escape this. Why am I even writing? No one's ever going to get to read this.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sounds Used<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Tearing, Newspaper, C.wav - InspectorJ</p>\n<p>Paper Crumple.wav - turchinoa<br/>crumpling Paper fx.wav - jammaj<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T05:53:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f6/5f6362e67bd2f1e008a7947ffb8f760b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["greembeems"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
