She must start a new band to show them up. Her fellow band-members aren't exactly who she thought she would be working with ... But she needs them, for now anyway!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The game is half visual novel, half band management sim.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCustomize your own band by choosing your genre, name, and logo. You give your band members tasks to practice in the week, raising 3 stats and generating stress: \r\n\t<strong>Music</strong>, <strong>Writing</strong>, and <strong>Star Quality</strong>. You play gigs to earn <strong>Popularity</strong>, which is the goal of the game: to get really popular.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\r\n\tThe game is split into two modes: \r\n\t<strong>Story Mode</strong> and <strong>Open-Ended Mode</strong>. During Story Mode, you will have 3 non-adjustable band members. After the story ends, you can form any kind of band you want and recruit who you wish. Story Mode is mostly linear so it can tell a strong story.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> </strong><strong>Robin Gilly</strong> <em>(Main Character)</em><br/>\r\n\tA not-so-sweet rocker girl.

He's easily distracted, so she has her work cut out for her if she's ever to bring out his true potential. Just really wants Robin to like him, like, so bad.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sterling Stone</strong><br/>\r\n\tRobin's former bandmate and lover.
