I kept waiting for the day for someone to toss together something simple, just so I could get a taste of that sweet, sweet forbidden fruit. No one built it. I figured a year is long enough to wait.</p><p>So, here you are. I present to you that sweet, forbidden fruit.</p><p>Three ships provided from Brent's STL generator at http://www.destinystlgenerator.com/ and then dropped them into a scene with some basic atmosphere and a ghost from blendswap (http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/75732). There's no sound. It should also be fairly evident this is a one hour project.</p><p>Anyway, Destiny is awesome and it's super hard to go wrong with the quality of these assets. It's fun to just look at them in VR and imagine... <em>what if?</em>!</p><p>If someone wants to do a youtube video, drop me a link and I'll put it as the featured video for this. There's just no time to explain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d9/8d9876712c3e1c82292cefa56b5f21f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ldvr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
