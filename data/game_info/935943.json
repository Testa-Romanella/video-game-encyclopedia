The game has an overall pixel art style and the map produced by the game is different on each run, which will also make the player have different fun on each breakthrough. However, as it is only a small demo being made, the maps are not made too big.</p>\n<p>During play, the player uses A and D on the keyboard to control the player's left and right movement, and Space to control the player's jump (the player double jumps). The player can only destroy an enemy if he steps on it from above, and will be destroyed if he touches it in any other direction. The player is invincible for the first two seconds of the game, and will not be destroyed in this state.</p>\n<p>The player will only win if they have picked up all the gems and destroyed all the enemies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T18:47:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb4d85ec57eeeea5eba7506afe8e591.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Squirtle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
