After discovering a strange machine you find yourself stuck in a one day time loop. To exit the time loop you need to fill the machine\u2019s empty slots with loopstones, and the only way to find loopstones is by exploring the island and interacting with the islanders. Along the way you discover that Loopstone Island might not be quite the peaceful paradise you originally thought it was.</p>\n\n<p>If you play our game,\u00a0please fill out this form to help us improve it!
