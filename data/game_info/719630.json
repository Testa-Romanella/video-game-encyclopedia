Different champions, also sculpted by the elder, have the same goal. Be aware, some might be friendly, some might be foes, you all have the same goal but even the strongest Champions can succumb to the darkness. An array of combat options will be available to your champion from melee, ranged and magic. Choose your \"Faction\" with care! Factions reside in specific villages around the CotC world and belong to different \"realms\". Be warned champion! Your actions in these realms will follow you and might effect your destiny.<br/><br/><br/> Your aspiration, since arriving in this world, was to cleanse the darkness and vanquish those responsible for it....the Fallen. These divine guardians, once beloved and cherished by all of Atham, unearthed the Crown of the Champion; an ancient divine artifact that balances the light and the darkness in all living things. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>---<br/><br/> The conflict between the guardians originated over control of the crown and lead to a split in their ranks.  One that wanted to preserve Atham as is; the other that wanted to dominate it. As the battle between the adversaries raged it enveloped the known world. Giant shadows were observed on the horizon, the echoed sounds of shattered mountains reverberated through the realms and violent tremors reduced civilizations to rubble. The final engagement between the two factions lead to the shattering of the crown and the apocalyptic release of energy that reforged the Guardians into calous power mongers. Blinded to their original belief of maintaining balance amongst all things they transformed into tyrannical desbots. Their malice, brutality, and oppression altered the very nature of Atham. <br/><br/><br/> The moment the Crown shattered every creature experienced and was changed by it.  This was followed by 5 mysterious objects that fell from the heavens and impacted the world with such force that it created fissures across the realms.  Following the \"Sundering\" despair invaded the hearts and minds of the people as an unnatural propagation of twisted creatures ravaged the lands searching for those remnants of the Crown. Inevitably this lead to a new conflict, the Divine War, and it has raged on for almost 400 years. <br/><br/><br/> Your goal, Champion is to find the remnants of the Crown and restore balance to Atham. Build your fortress, find allies and  save the realms. Crafting and fighting your way to honor and glory.
