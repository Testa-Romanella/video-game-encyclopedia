At beta launch, it features my two favorate characters that I've made; Superworm, my comic book hero that has no relation to the book of it's name, and Fishy, the protagonist of 5 Star Fishy. I may update it to add in more fighters and stages if there is\u00a0enough demand, or if I feel like it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T05:58:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eee/eee3bc9df729f00fdf6bb4137fc4dbcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SuperWorm Gaming"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
