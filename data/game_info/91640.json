Oh and the mines are cats.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Please play and comment! I desperately need feedback!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Editor</strong></p>\n<p>The game includes the level editor I use to create the game content. In the final version the players will be able to create and share their own adventures. Currently you can view and edit the levels. This doesn't save in the build yet, so experiment away.</p>\n<p><strong>Platforms</strong></p>\n<p>My greatest hope is to release the game on the Nintendo Switch.<br/>Besides that that it will be released on Steam / itch.io / mobile (premium).</p>\n<p><strong>Please play and comment!
