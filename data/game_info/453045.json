Fairly short with most of the emphasis on dialogue and visuals. Fusion of some canon and legends lore with my own spin on it.\u00a0 I might expand it later to go deeper into his life but for now this was already pretty heavy.</p>\n<p>Content warnings: child abuse, general family turmoil... it's Darth Maul...</p>\n<p>I don't own Star Wars or Darth Maul obviously! Names + characters + music does not belong to me but all art is original + some RPG Maker 2000 sfx.</p>\n<p>(Feel free to use this as fan fiction inspiration!)</p>\n\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys to move, space or enter to interact, escape to open menu to shut down (you won't need to manage inventory or anything like that)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/393/393b79baba3466f0a9fc30efd1b6af1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["necropocene"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
