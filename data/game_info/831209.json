DO NOT PLAY IT. Please, don't play it. This game is in Spanish, and it was just a prototype of making a game with start and finish. It is like a minute long, I barely put any true effort and, as you may have expect, the game is TRASH. I just want it here as a ''backup'', so I don't permanently lose my RPG maker finished projects. So... Just skip this one, or play it for 90 hours. I don't give a flip, honestly. It is open source, so change it, or do a full-blown remake or whatever, I don't care. This game should burn in hell, my creation should burn in hell. Let's laugh at this stupid game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T14:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52c/52cfa9dfb3ff78608554b75cdad1c908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuddenCombustion"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
