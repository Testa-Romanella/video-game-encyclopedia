COULD exist.<br/><br/>Now, with 500+ horsepower supercars and realistic physics, you can tackle those tracks that only exist in our imagination, but COULD be built in reality if we ever dared...<br/><br/>And, with in iPhone 6+ and a cheap Google Cardboard headset, you can do the whole thing in 3-D VR... which is really quite amazing.
