The first version of idle game with spinning cogwheels was made in June 2017 during a 3-days gamejam. As the concept proved to be interesting for the players, the development continued. The development of the game is screencast and then published as 1:60 timelapse video. Some development phases are broadcast to the players as live videos and often the players' suggestions are implemented online.<br/><br/>The primary source of inspiration for the overall concept were the mechanisms of interconnected cogs, which the developer liked to assemble and disassemble in his school years. The current underwater setting was inspired by Joules Verne's \"20 000 Leagues under the Sea\", Disney's \"Atlantis\" dieselpunk cartoon and Brian Kesinger's \"Walking Your Octopus\" illustrations. Also the Underwater world was most demanded, according to the players' vote in the game's facebook group. Work started in March 2018, public alpha was launched in May 2018, beta in July 2018.<br/><br/>This world introduces many new concepts unique to the series. They are: <br/> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reworked game engine with LEGO-like \"pins\" concept, which let design even the most bizarre machines interactions;</li>\n<li>Resources production chains. Money\ud83d\udcb5 is produced from air, various gases can be combined to create new substances;</li>\n<li>Playable area expansion. Sideways expansion is performed with clockwork crabs and submarines, upwards expansion: with main base upgrades and downwards: by drilling the seabed;</li>\n<li>Wide usage of taps together with spins for interaction with machines;</li>\n<li>New objects are not only bought, but also discovered (treasure chests, more underwater volcanoes, ore deposits);</li>\n<li>Machines purchase interface is the most convenient here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Players continue giving new suggestions, which eventually appear in the game. <br/> <br/> </p>\n<strong>Main trailer:</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/590/590838abfb0869ad59ce6c2e880e54bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Airapport"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
