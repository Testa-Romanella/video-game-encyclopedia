You love computers and building them since you were a kid and now you think it will be a good idea to make your family proud and start your own business with money borrowed from unconventional sources.  But the business environment is a harsh one and you need to make your own decisions at each step to make it through. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game supports two modes: storyline and endless.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the storyline mode, Ilie borrowed money from lone sharks and has to pay each day, otherwise, they will close his business. During the relatively small campaign (which takes up to 8 days), Ilie will be visited by various individuals and he will need to make decisions that will affect both the gameplay and endings. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the endless mode, we offered a gameplay opportunity with an unlimited number of days. Your only purpose is to make your business survive by paying your loans to the bank at the end of each day, while the gameplay begins to be harder and harder.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeveloper note: This is our first indie game launched, so, please take a moment to enjoy our hard work. If you have time and karma, leave your constructive feedback so we can improve this game in our updates. We are a handful (two) of developers who loved games since we are kids. We want to provide a unique experience to our players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T07:44:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85c/85cba302621ebe3250f360e83b728a4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mindtech"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mindtech"], "esrb_rating": null}
