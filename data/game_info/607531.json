It was created during Godot Wild Jam # 33.<br/>There were big plans to add a lot of things, but time ran out.<br/></p>\n<p>We play the role of a Dark Magician. Our task is to gather an army of minions to take revenge on the mages who banished us. Our first target is the creatures from the nearby forest and their spiritual guardian - a large mushroom called Yayway.</p>\n<p>Will Bloomstein get his revenge?</p>\n<p>Will he gain enough strength?</p>\n<p>Will he defeat Yayway?</p>\n<p>I do not know.
