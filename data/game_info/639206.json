I wanted to see if I could create a slot machine, and as it turns out...I kinda can.</p>\n<p>The slots aren't always the most accurate (oops) but it gets it right most of the time. It's also really easy, the payouts could be distributed better or more slots could be introduced to increase the difficulty. Also: Gamble responsibly!</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>Simply press the \"Spin Again\" button to play the slots and try to make more money than you're losing. Each spin costs $10. If you don't have that, then you lose.\u00a0When you get bored, press the Escape key to exit.</p>\n<p>PAYOUTS:</p>\n<p>Two Matching: $50</p>\n<p>All Three Matching: $1000</p>\n<p>Per Green: $10</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T06:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b5/1b5b6dac328c6e0444bf91104356c1da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ItsTheBrandonC"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
