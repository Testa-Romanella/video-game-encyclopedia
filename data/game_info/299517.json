You must play as an alien from the Xanara galaxy that has come to make his friends in the Milky-Way galaxy not suffer a fate that is pure torture. The sun will explode in approximately 10 minutes, so you should try to make minimal friends suffer their impending doom. This version was made in 6 days, and I hope you enjoy it! Thank you, and make sure to check out my Kickstarter page, or\u00a0YouTube\u00a0to support my game development, as a small indie developer!
