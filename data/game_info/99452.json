Use them to navigate your way through the asteroid field. Don't worry about crashing - the ship doesn't take damage.</li><li>Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.</li><li>Press R to restart the game.</li><li>Press H to toggle display of the text.</li><li>I accidentally left fuel consumption in! You may find that thrusters stop working after a while. This is because they have run out of fuel.
