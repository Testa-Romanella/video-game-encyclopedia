When Marc and Caroline planned their romantic getaway, they didn\u2019t know that it would turn their lives into jeopardy. Can you find a way to prevent this terrible crime and put the murderer to justice? Or will you forever be stuck in this horrific time loop?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAWAKE is an award-winning entry to Adventure Jam 2016 and has been majorly overhauled for its Definitive Edition. There\u2019s a murderer out to get you, and it\u2019s happening again and again. You\u2019re stuck in a time loop \u2013 will you find a way to escape?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe recommend finishing the game in one sitting. It takes about as long as a TV episode. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cAwake immediately captures the player's attention with confident and stylish visuals, high quality voice acting and an elegant user interface, to the extent that you'd be forgiven for forgetting you were playing an entry to a game jam. But where it truly excels is in the \u201cah-ha\u201d moment, when you realise that it's stepped beyond the bounds of a well-produced adventure, and into the realm of innovative game design.\u201c \u2013 Joseph Humphrey of inkle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFull English speech, with the option for subtitles in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian or Brazilian Portuguese.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T04:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/599/599a8271c91259a5009be322047f259d.jpg", "website": "http://awake-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["Storyyeller Games", "Off The Beaten Track", "Off The Beaten Track UG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Schreihals Interactive", "Off The Beaten Track UG haftungsbeschraenkt"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
