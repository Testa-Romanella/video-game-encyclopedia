The challenge is to recognize the anomaly, the subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle difference that will allow you to move to the next level. <br/><br/>Is the coast clear? Press 0 in the elevator to proceed. Notice an anomaly? Something extraordinary or surreal? Stay composed and press B to peel back a layer of reality.<br/><br/>Strive to reach level 0 to escape and achieve freedom in this compact immersive first-person puzzle game.<h3>Play Time </h3>15 - 60 Minutes<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Over 30 unique events after the elevator doors open.<br/></li><li> A catchy elevator tune you won't forget.<br/></li><li> Hidden endings that are tough to find.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T10:50:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee2/ee20a330d72ae08d9c22249f7d897ca5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arvus Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Arvus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
