Fight with sword and fish but beware! The ocean is a strange place indeed. Over 100 different fish, 10 levels and a good old fashioned boss fight.</p>\n<p>This was my <strong>first</strong> game. I have learned <em>SO</em> much since making this. I hope you see that a lot of heart went into every little pixel. I will always look back on it fondly. Enjoy! And if you like it let me know.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0eb/0eb5f9db0a32383aa14c14aa11f9ed94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Tartle Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
