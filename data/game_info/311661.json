You can aim at the enemy while stopping on the spot. This is useful, but the pleasure as a flight simulator is halved.<br/>\r\nVarious terrain and weather.<br/>\r\nDamage caused by a collision on the ground is minimal.Instead, the physical inertia from the impact makes it harder for the player to maneuver the helicopter.<br/>\r\nThe battlefield is 2 kilometers square except for some levels. It will be game over when you go out of the area.<br/>\r\nThe enemy is not only ground weapons, but also unmanned airplanes.<br/>\r\nAllied flying squadrons will protect you.<br/>\r\nSince only the machine gun can be used in the first half of the game, you need to aim at the enemy accurately.<br/>\r\nIn the second half of the game, you can use homing rockets, which makes the game play more like arcade games.<br/>\r\nThis game uses music selected carefully from the previous songs composed by Sonic-Alpha.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou need a graphics board to play this game.<br/>\r\nThe graphic settings may optimize the sensitivity of the mouse.<br/>\r\nI think that the setting of the joystick can be done at the first boot screen.
