There have been significant changes since we first told the tale. I know you are going to ask what so here is a list.</p>\n<p>1st.\u00a0 We are now using DAAD instead of PAWS which means we can reach a wider audience.</p>\n<p>2nd.\u00a0 We freed up some memory, and as a result, we have enhanced object descriptions.</p>\n<p>3rd.\u00a0 You now have a notebook. You can examine it to see who you have found to question. You can also examine particular pages to remind yourself of the facts you have uncovered on different suspects. *</p>\n<p>4th.\u00a0 The game now has a difficulty setting which means once it has been solved it can be played again.</p>\n<p>5th.\u00a0 There have been a lot of grammar and spelling corrections.</p>\n<p>6th.\u00a0 Graphics have been added for the larger memory targets.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmmm,\" said Sam \"That is quite a few changes. But I hope it hasn't come at the expense of telling the rest of my cases.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course not Sam. In fact, Robert has given me a long description of what happens in the next one.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's alright then,\" said Sam with a shrug \"but I'll be keeping an eye on you to make sure there are no more re-releases.\"</p>\r\nThe Game\r\n<p>You play the role of Sam Boon, an L.A. Private Detective, or you will be. You recently received your permit to practice and have just moved into a new office. Hopefully, you will get a case soon as the first month's rent is due in a few days and you can't currently afford it. If you don't get a case your career will end before it has begun.</p>\n<p>It may just be your young imagination, but you can feel something is just around the corner.</p>\r\nPlaying the Game\r\n<p>The game is an old-school text adventure, so put away your joysticks and get your fingers ready for some typing exercises.\r\n</p>\r\nTo Move\r\n<p>Movements are all in compass directions, therefore you can go North, East, South, and West. To do this you can type\r\n</p>\n<p>GO NORTH, or NORTH or for short just N.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can also go UP (U) or Down (D)\r\n</p>\r\nInteraction\r\n<p>To progress through the game you will need to interact with your environment and objects.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you type LOOK or L your current location will be redescribed.\r\n</p>\n<p>Objects can be EXAMINED or just X, for example, X SINK.\r\n</p>\n<p>Things can also be OPENED, CLOSED, LOCKED, and\u00a0UNLOCKED.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can question characters for information about other characters or items and locations. For example, SAY TO JANE \"TELL ME ABOUT THE KITCHEN\".</p>\n<p>Once you think you know who is guilty you need to accuse them in the following manner, SAY JANE \"I ACCUSE SAM\". She will reflect on your evidence and decide if you have solved the case or not.</p>\n<p>You also have a notebook. You can X NOTEBOOK to find out which suspects you have met. You can also X NOTEBOOK ABOUT JANE to look at the entry of a particular character. *</p>\n<p>The game contains hints, these are turned on, on the easiest difficulty level, but off for all other levels. If you want to turn them on or off TURN HINTS ON/OFF.</p>\n<p>Talking of turning things on and off you can also TURN EXITS ON/OFF to display exits or not and SHOW EXITS for a refresher on available exits. You can also TURN GRAPHICS ON/OFF on platforms that support graphics.</p>\r\nInventory\r\n<p>You can only carry a limited number of objects, sometimes to get a new object you will need to drop one. Your ability to carry objects depends on your difficulty level.</p>\n<p>To add or remove objects you need to GET or DROP them, for example, GET HAT or DROP HAT.\r\n</p>\n<p>If an item is clothing you can WEAR it or REMOVE it.\r\n</p>\n<p>To see what you are carrying type INVENTORY or I.\r\n</p>\n<p>This should be enough to get you started, there is plenty more to discover.\r\n</p>\n<p>There is no way to die\u00a0in this game, however, rent day might come around before you can afford it if you make the wrong moves.</p>\n<p>* Notebook not available on Amstrad CPC due to memory constraints.</p>\r\nStarting the game\r\nSPECTRUM\r\n<p>There are several versions for the Spectrum machines.
