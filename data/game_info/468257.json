Each of the five levels include different settings, including but not limited to underwater, space, etc. The objective of the game is to control the ball using the A and D keys to avoid all of the obstacles. Furthermore, some levels include stationary obstacles while others have oncoming obstacles that may be more difficult to avoid. Progress does not save; however, a menu selection screen is included on the main screen of the game to choose your level, although it is recommended to start at level 1 and progress from there.\u00a0You can play the games with zero downloads straight from itch.io! Before starting, make sure to put the game in full screen mode by clicking the button in the bottom right of the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e172ef50b7f17cc371381bb87fba0cbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MaxGoldy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
