Witches don't play around...\"<br/><p>You can gamble a good amount of things in games of chance. Money, power, and in this case: souls. Not only yours\u00a0of course, you're not stupid so you gamble something that's worth a lot less. The fate of your followers' and your souls are one dice roll away from the waterways.\r\nDraw cards from your grimoire\u00a0to determine whose souls are on the line during each round along with the randomly-generated,\u00a0viscera-filled dice set before you. Analyze your opponent's cards to determine what resources you should prioritize. Then roll! Spend your resources carefully, they'll be gone by the time the next turn begins.\u00a0\r\nStrategize if you want to go for easier targets that don't give as much soul or risk it all on going for the heavy hitters. Once you or your opponent reach 100 soul, that's when you can hit it where it hurts. Just don't be the one to get their soul taken.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Right click to inspect/return object from inspection.
