{"id": 436757, "slug": "glitch-escape", "name": "Glitch Escape", "name_original": "Glitch Escape", "description": "This game was originally inspired by sleep paralysis and the metaphysical theories surrounding astral projection being one of the gateways to high dimensions. The game tells a story about characters who struggle with their reality and falls victim to an antagonist who wants to keep them forever in the \"astral realm\". The protagonist must face their fear, the antagonist: a version of themself that does not want to wake up, in order to save the others (who are also versions of them from other world lines).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game was made by 16 UCSC students from the games department.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCredits<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTechnical Producer:\t        David Monroe<br/>\r\nArt Producer:    \t\tTiffany Phan<br/>\r\nTechnical Lead:\t\tSeiji Emery, Rachel Haub<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCreative Director:\t\t\tTiffany Phan<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMusic + Sound Design: \t\tCoy Youngblood<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLead Character Artist:\t\tErica Li<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLead Environmental Artist:       Sam Feng<br/>\n<br/>\r\n3D Artists:\t\t\t\tSam Feng, Erica Li, Eizi Yu<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVisual Effects + Shaders:        Sam Feng, Seiji Emery, Rachel Haub<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLead Programmer: \t\t        Seiji Emery<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGameplay Programmers:        Seiji Emery, Vladislav Kardash, Rachel Haub<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdditional Programming:\tHardwin Bui, Lubin Tu, Brennen Mcculloch<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLevel Design:\t\t\t\tBenjamin Chen<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNarrative Director: \t\t\tKris Torres<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCutscene Design:\t\t\tTiffany Phan, Kris Torres, Hardwin Bui<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConcept Art:\t\t                Tiffany Phan, Erica Li, Sam Feng, Manon Lefebvre, Kris Torres<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUser interface + 2d Art:          Tiffany Phan, Kris Torres<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUser interface Programming: \tLubin Tu, Rachel Haub<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRigging + Animation:              Sam Feng, Eizi Yu, Erica Li, Sam Wolfe<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTrailer + Marketing:\t\t        Tiffany Phan, Brennen Mcculloch<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMany Thanks To:\t\t        Eddie Melcer<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Robin Hunicke<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Marcelo Viana Neto<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Elin Carstendottir<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Tad Leckman<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Max Kreminski<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t        Sean Douglas<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll the folks at the CMPM + AGPM games depts at UCSC<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(and in particular, all of the fellow 17X students that we weathered together with under a global pandemic + everything else 2020 decided to throw at us, and still made some kick-ass games with regardless :) )<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd last but not least, all of our supportive friends + family, both in and outside of the UCSC games program\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\r\nThanks for playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T11:15:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04b/04b309249054d8ab0265ed23f7164a88.jpg", "website": "https://glitch-escape.wixsite.com/game", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tiffany Phan", "glitchescape", "Hardwin Bui", "Brennan McCulloch", "Seiji Emery", "David Monroe", "Rachel Haub", "Sam Feng", "Benjamin Chen", "Eizi Zu", "Erica Li", "Kristofer Torres", "Coy Youngblood", "Vladislav Kardash", "Lubin Tu", "Manon Lefebvre", "Sam Wolfe"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["UCSC Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
