It took about 2 days to complete, and it's a wholesale knock-off of\u00a0heavily inspired by Reigns. You play as The Government as it attempts to balance the interests of all interested parties while preventing the planet from burning.</p>\n<p>Positives: I'm surprised to look back on some of the pixel art I did, considering the short time span. Mother Nature's clothes and face, in particular. The overall aesthetic and polish is pretty good too.</p>\n<p>Negatives: It's fairly one-note, very content-light, and clearly rushed. I also got the peace sign wrong and instead drew the Mercedes logo, so there's that. There's no sound, either.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:33:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/9792dcc77d866d19110ff377c032bf75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MsJofish"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
