He remembers his childhood. His toys. His monsters.<br/><br/>Breeder Homegrown is a short horror game about a family dealing with a strange creature over several generations. You will encounter some puzzles but the game relies mostly on atmosphere, music and dialogues. Perfect for people who enjoyed games like \u00abTo the Moon\u00bb or \u00abUndertale\u00bb and want to spend an hour having a similar experience.<br/><br/>The whole experience takes about 40-90 minutes depending on how much you want to explore.<br/><br/>This is the \u00abDirector's Cut\u00bb version of Breeder Homegrown.
