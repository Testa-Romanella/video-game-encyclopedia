Perinthia is a city which has its foundation based on a rule created by the leaders (The\u00a0astronomers). This rule states that the city will reflect on \"harmony, nature\u2019s reason and the benevolence of the gods\". However, the city does not reflect on this rule and the citizens are upset by this.\u00a0They dream of making a \"utopia\" that truly reflects on the rule and they wish for change.\u00a0The astronomers take no responsibility for their management of the city. To escape taking responsibility, they hold a trial and use a fake god as their scapegoat to confess their wrongdoings to the citizens, and convince the citizens that the gods are the ones to blame.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your job as the player is to gather pieces of evidence which prove that the citizens are being deceived by the astronomers within the time limit.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Full name: Linda Tieu</p>\n<p>Lab: 1</p>\n<p>Link to game documentation:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W1qZreCLgCHzCnll5-8vyhL3cW5URPWaflnx36b9zlI/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T11:58:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/545/545634a33ad3d1bd6b6f521e813dd21a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lt9596"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
