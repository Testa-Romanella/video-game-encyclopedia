Through immersive VR gameplay, users experience alarming visions of the future, travel to different ecosystems, go on quests to collect seeds, and grow saplings into trees.  The objective of the game is to inspire players to take action in the real world, and for every virtual tree planted, an actual tree will be planted through our partnerships with local mangrove plantation programs starting in the UAE and then expanding around the world.\r\n</li><li>Objective: Initially to be presented at a booth part of COP28 (UAE), Green Impact VR aims to raise awareness about climate change and inspire individuals to take action in a fun and interactive way.  The UAE have the mandate to plant 100 million mangroves by 2030 as p[art of its 2nd National determined contributions (NDC) adopted during the Paris Agreement.  Within the booth which will act as a focal point, our local partner\u2019s objective is to plant 9,000 mangrove trees through a virtual planting activation. We are proposing to do this virtual activation in a way that is as immersive as possible via VR game with Green Impact VR to encourage individuals and organizations to take action by planting real trees.\r\n</li><li>Key Features:<br/>\n</li><li>Immersive gameplay: Green Impact VR offers a fully immersive VR experience that transports players to different ecosystems, where they can be engaged in quests, collect seeds, grow saplings, and virtually plant saplings.  Virtual-to-Real planting: Every virtual tree planted in the game will trigger the planting of a real tree through our partnerships with local mangrove plantation programs around the world.  Educational Content: Through in-game resources and interactions with non-player characters, players will learn about the benefits of planting trees and the importance of taking action to combat climate change.<br/>Future features Multiplayer and Global: Players will be able to join the game with others around the world, and collaborate to reach the common goal of planting as many trees as possible.  New partnerships with other planters worldwide (mangrove and other tree species)  Real time data visualization / Planter Dashboard:  planters to update from a PC or App the status of the planting \u2013 and create real time visualization of the status of the growth in real time.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>models used:</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/dangerous-beauty-diorama-be223962b73c47daa1786fd...</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/skink-01c4356f2600496795123d5867ff592b</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/garden-props-7ac1a7bf54284380b18944aad34b9656</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T15:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/613/6135eb0b41ad19c9de0d527f73d44958.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MohammedAlaa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
