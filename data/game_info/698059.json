In order to work nice on a qwerty keyboard you should be able to swap it to azerty pretty easily ( on windows 10 you can press shift + alt to do this ).</p>\n<p>There is 3 characters in BAGAR : Blue, Red, and Green. They all have specific movement stats and capacities.</p>\n<p>In order to win you have to drop down your opponent's life from 100 to zero.</p>\n<p>More details in the readme.txt !</p>\n<p>My twitter : @Shayd_RoA</p>\n<p>My mail : maxattal0@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:03:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adf/adfd20521a75b5943ac4bf94fe269182.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MaximeAttal"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
