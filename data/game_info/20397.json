We are working with the idea that death is not the end. There are no health packs, because we promote death in Man Alive! Actually, you HAVE to kill yourself to progress in our game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat is why we believe it is something different and new, that we hope to share with you all. This campaign is very important to us, because we know we can create something fun!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe need your support to help us create Man Alive, to keep challenging the game industry and provide a steady flow of new ideas.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/975/975651de6c400569cf074f0d17a4720f.jpg", "website": "http://globalempiresoft.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 38}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Global Empire Soft"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Global Empire Soft"], "esrb_rating": null}
