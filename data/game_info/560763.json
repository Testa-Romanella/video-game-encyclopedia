Can you survive 10 fights to ascend and become the Champion of the Pit?<br/><h3>A Challenging Journey</h3>Ascending is no easy task.  When you die while challenging the pit, you'll have to restart from the very beginning.  While death is expected, it's a learning opportunity.  You'll find yourself dodging, jumping, and shooting through an eclectic collection of people, creatures, and even inanimate objects with unique attack patterns, quirks, and mechanics.  You'll also learn to harness the power of each boss's unique ability, and master their use.<h3>Every Run is Unique</h3>From the bosses you fight to the abilities you obtain, each time you challenge the pit is a new experience.  With powerful abilities that combine in interesting ways, you'll find yourself fighting the same boss differently from run to run.<h3>What to Expect in the Pit</h3><ul><li>A memorable set of bosses with challenging attacks<br/></li><li>Powerful abilities with exciting combinations<br/></li><li>A helpful shopkeeper that will help the inexperienced and reward veterans<br/></li><li>A charming 4-color art style and chiptune soundtrack</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T02:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ed/4edc9ac6fc54fe21b8973b574018a00a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Powerdive Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Powerdive Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
