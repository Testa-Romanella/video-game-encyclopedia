This game made in a week aims to redesign the fundamentals that made the original Atari pinball into a new modern format. I aimed to achieve this by incorporating the idea that the pinball board is ever changing as you play, allowing for strategy along with forcing the player to be accustomed to a changing game state.</p>\n<p>Piecewise pinball is a spin on the classic staple of pinball games where instead of trying to go for a high score on a static pinball board, the player must tackle an ever changing board of different elements that are designed to be challenging, yet rewarding. As you hit score checkpoints you will need to replace one of the 3 parts of the pinball board with a new obstacle. Each run is unique, so how high of a score can you get?</p>\n<p>This being my final Unity project from my first stretch of making games, I personally believe it exemplifies my growth as a game designer in programming, design, art, music/sfx, etc. This game has come to be one of my favorites to come out of this series and will definitely want to continuing updating the game or reproducing it in a larger form.*</p>\n<p>*Though still likely not coming soon, game design takes a while :p.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ed/0ed41f048d9cc2cde59e070ec21373fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["IXtimes"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
