Do whatever you need to do... duck, weave, dodge and crawl... just don't get hit in the face! Taking gameplay influences from old-school arcade games and combining that with room-scale VR, DGHITF is as simple as it sounds, and that's what makes it fun.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't Get Hit In The Face includes 4 game modes of increasing difficulty, and an awesome 13 song soundtrack. It's fun on its own as VR arcade game, and is also an excellent addition to a VR workout regimen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d0684038f481f0c1e6c4de1d5469670a.jpg", "website": "http://www.dracosoftware.com/dghitf/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DracoSoftware"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DracoSoftware"], "esrb_rating": null}
