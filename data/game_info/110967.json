The brief was to re-create the game <em>Berzerk</em> in the style of an assigned artist. My assigned artist was Grandma Moses. What I took away from her paintings was winding paths and countrysides and smiling people. So my game is about exploring a procedurally generated countryside and waving to people, rather than escaping a maze and shooting robots. </p><p>I tried to be a good student and write a postmortem about my approach to the game here.</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>arrow keys - walk</p><p>space - wave</p><p>r - reset world and character</p><p>z - run</p><p>(((super secret cheat code: hold 'h' at the start of the game to activate <strong>dog mode</strong>!)))</p><p><strong>Audio Credits:</strong></p><p>Voices: myself and my partner, Helen.</p><p>Music: 'Winona Rag' by the Ray Brothers</p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools.
