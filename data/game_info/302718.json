Well, here's\u00a0a mean little twist: When the\u00a0game mode suddenly switches, which is indicated by\u00a0\"switchy\" \u00a0lifting its nose, you'll have to press\u00a0SPACE <strong><em>not</em></strong> to jump. But that's not all. With each game mode switch, collectables turn into obstacles and vice versa. Got it?</p>\n<p>Good Luck!<br/><br/></p>\n<p><em>This game was made within one week\u00a0<em>for the 1st\u00a0semester course \u201cPlaying with Video Games\u201d of the \u201cGame Development and Research\u201d Master program at the Cologne Game Lab.</em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>The task was to make a game with visuals of only three colors and just one button as input.</em></p>\n<p><em>Credits:</em></p>\n<p><em>Cordula Heithausen - Game\u00a0Design,\u00a0Programming,\u00a0Visuals, Level Design</em></p>\n<p><em>Olivier\u00a0Haas - Sound Design, Music, Level Design</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T03:11:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/300/300080bb75a4a2e8f13e8dd1e565e259.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Discordula"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
