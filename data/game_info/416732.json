It is short, and there is not much to say about it. I find it fun and terrifying, so I decided to upload.<br/></p>\n<p>A city has been completely abducted by aliens who aim to colonize planet Earth. For some reason, you have not been kidnapped. Your goal is to find the bed hidden in one of the houses and escape what, in your hope, would be a terrible nightmare.</p>\n<p>- You must find a weapon to defend yourself from aliens. The pistol kills more quickly, but does not have automatic fire, being necessary to press the fire button several times. The machine gun takes longer to kill, but it has automatic fire.</p>\n<p>- Medicines are used to restore your life.</p>\n<p>- You can refill your ammo with cartridges found in houses.</p>\n<p>- The \"I\" key on the keyboard corresponds to the Inventory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:47:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a12104db0a9091f17774bff3e32987f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Edy Souza"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
