Consequently and unsurprisingly, the more they harvest SCP-354-B and the more they slaughter SCP-354-A entities, the larger and stronger the swarms become. But you got no choice, similar to the Y-909 compound, SCP-354-B is just too valuable so these harvesting operations must continue as much as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-19T02:47:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd81bb32865653f484e327f32cedc256.jpg", "website": "https://neuroticfly.itch.io/scp-bloodwater", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
