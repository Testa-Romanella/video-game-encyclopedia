Cycle through your three choices, then fire your pointed cards at the rectangular ones that are slowly descending towards you! As you keep making winning matchups, the rectangular cards will descend faster and faster! How long can you keep it up before they make it past the dotted line OR before you run out of cards from your careless mistakes?</p>\n<p>Controls (numpad keyboard recommended but not required):</p>\n<p><strong>[A][D]</strong> or <strong>Numpad [1][3]\u00a0</strong>- Navigate menu</p>\n<p>[<strong>S]</strong> or <strong>Numpad [2]\u00a0</strong>- Confirm</p>\n<p><strong>[A][S][D]</strong> or <strong>Numpad [1][2][3]\u00a0</strong>- Cycle cards</p>\n<p><strong>[Q][W][E] </strong>or\u00a0<strong>Numpad [4][5][6]</strong> - Fire cards</p>\n<p>This is my entry for the 2023 Nokia 3310 Game Jam. While a rather loose interpretation of the theme of \"Fast &amp; Slow\", the cards do start off moving\u00a0slow but will inevitably go\u00a0faster and faster. Still, I'm not really expecting to win, given this is my first ever game jam and given that my competition seems much more versed in this than I am. Nevertheless, I hope you find my game as entertaining as I did while playtesting it!<br/></p>\n<p>Credit goes to Trix's \"Getting Started\" GMS2 template for making this simpler for me!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T04:43:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/466/4666caf51579b18c44734218cdbf1aa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Markus McCloud"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
