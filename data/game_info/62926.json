The RUN will put you under pressure. The runners' lives are on the line and situations may get tense!<br/><br/>If you just want a chill exploratory experience, this game is still for you. <br/>In EXPLORE mode, you are free to take your time exploring programs and hacking ICE. Relax and take in the views, find all the pieces of the message or discover what lies inside the Black ICE.<br/><br/>ICE surrounds some programs on the Grid.
