This also disguises the difficulty of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T18:02:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9dee520dc3b59c82925ebb7d0cfb1d67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yuju wang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
