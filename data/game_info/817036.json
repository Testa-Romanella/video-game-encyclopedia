It should've been set in the 70s, but back then, they didn't have such great hairspray.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Roxy's family situation is quite complicated. Her mom is an American living in Japan and her dad is a Japanese living in the United States. Since their relationship broke up quickly, Roxy grew up with her dad in the US and Yana with her mom in Japan.<br/></p>\n<p>When, at the age of 19, Roxy finally arrives in Japan to join Yana in a sports camp near Kanagawa, everyone seems disappointed in her. Due to her quiet nature, she seems \"little\" American to them. There are rumors that she is a bore, which annoys her a lot, because Roxy has her passion - playing tennis.</p>\n<p>Soon Roxy meets her opponent, a talented tennis player named Kimura. Despite the negative first impression, the two of them grow a liking toward\u00a0each other. But there is a problem: the camp will end someday and Roxy will have to return home.</p>\n<p>Perhaps her sister will be able to help somehow?...</p>\n<p><strong>Player's Age: 16+</strong> (contains trigger topics such as domestic abuse and\u00a0alcohol)</p>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>~10000 words of a professionally written text by a published author.</li><li>A linear storyline / no choices (sorry... we believe in determinism when it comes to love!);\r\n</li><li>Ultra kitschy\u00a0characters with headbands, boomboxes, and fancy stockings.</li><li>A funky, electronic soundtrack which will teleport you right away to the 80s;</li><li>Sound effects to enhance the feel of being in the game (e.g. plane sounds, tennis match ambient, etc.)</li><li>3 main locations:\u00a0airport, home, and sports camp, with 19 different backgrounds.</li><li>A hippie-style\u00a0game interface which should be more rock n' roll, but certain people never depart from their favorite eras.</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>MOM(&amp;DAD)</strong>\u00a0are the ones responsible for the two sisters living separately, and in extremely different environments.\u00a0None of them felt at ease in their home country, so they've both moved out. (Only MOM appears as a sprite, DAD doesn't.)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>ROXY </strong>is an introverted tennis player who grew up with her Dad. She doesn't like breaking rules, never had alcohol except a sip of sake,\u00a0and she's not interested in anything besides getting even better at her favorite sport.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>YANA </strong>is an extraverted dancer who grew up with Mom. She's hyper energetic, very intrigued by the western culture, and just can't wait to hang out with her \"foreign\"\u00a0sister.\u00a0She's also in love with Brother Stanley, dance teacher from their camp.</p>\n<p><strong>BROTHER STANLEY</strong> is the star of the camp, an American who always says hi and carries the boombox everywhere. He's very chilled... as long as you don't tell him something that upsets him.</p>\n<p><strong>KIMURA </strong>is a self-confident tennis player, who immediately catches an interest in Roxy, but seems to hide certain things from her.</p>\n<p><strong>MIDORI </strong>is a quiet girl who's not into parties, or gossip, and because of it, she immediately becomes one of Roxy's closest friends at the camp.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Hasalynx Games doesn't receive any external funding,\u00a0and mostly relies on unpaid\u00a0human effort and free resources generously made available (or donated) by different creators to keep going.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>If these games\u00a0spark your curiosity, please buy them (they're so cheap!), comment on them, and spread positive word.
