Doing this just as a hobby.\u00a0I followed Heartbeast's Youtube series for the Hack n Slash series, which I highly recommend checking out. The art assets are also from Heartbeast's tutorial. Also followed FriendlyCosmonaut's tutorial for making a menu. The music is also not mine, I got it from Helltaker(Vitality) and Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[cl-r](Sound of Night Wind). Everything besides the gameplay is just placeholders for now. The options menu works ok but I am not worrying about that right now as the gameplay is what is most important to me. Feel free to test the options out but I am aware of the amount of bugs in them which I will fix later on. Remappable inputs works, but is not fully polished yet as some text just says numbers for the input. Controller also works well I think, can connect it, disconnect it, and connect it again without having to restart the game.</p>\n<p><strong>What is already implemented but needs art assets:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Block break, more combos, and weapon swapping.</p>\n<p><strong>What is implemented but was scrapped and will be revisited:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Projectiles, and charged attacks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:08:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51f/51f49be2344860d8e0efee6e4daf98b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adrx1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
