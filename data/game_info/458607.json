The game operates like the well-known childhood game, Rock- Paper- Scissors. I improved the traditional game by switching it to an electronic version, by turning it into a single-player game and by adding a variety of\u00a0visual aids. In addition, I changed the items in the game to natural elements: fire, air and earth which make the application far more pleasant.<br/></p>\n<p>I draw all the pictures that are shown in the game myself in a software called FireAlpaca</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T05:44:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59d/59d0b3df078f6125b56cd14b9549af51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamingGirl101"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
