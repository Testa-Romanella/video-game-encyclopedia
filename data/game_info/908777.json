To beat the levels, you have to collect orbs with different colors. Orbs add different platforms that you have to use to transverse the level. Red adds death, and normal platforms, blue platforms make you bounce, and green lets you slide down and wall jump.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy playing!</p>\n\n<p>Music by my friend Jimmy Mack</p>\n<p>Animations by my friend Steven Runge</p>\n<p>Sprite art, Programming and Level Design by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:03:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67eafe74e68c415021f965445954cafc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zayd"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
