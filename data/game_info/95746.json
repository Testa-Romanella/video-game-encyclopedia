{"id": 95746, "slug": "growing-sakura", "name": "Growing Sakura", "name_original": "Growing Sakura", "description": "<p>Growing Sakura is minimalist puzzle game.</p><p>You have a hexagonal field and a few sakura buds on it. Clicking on them you create three initial branches. You can continue any branch making Y-forks and I-forks clicking on the branch buds by the left or the right mouse button. Branches don't grow in some direction if it's impossible (the corresponding cell is already occupied or doesn't exist). So, it's very important to click on the buds in the right order. Your goal is to cover all the field.</p><p>Growing Sakura contains 40 levels, the last of them are pretty difficult.</p><p>The game was made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 34. You may consider it as a prototype of a bigger game I'm going to make in near future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ef/2ef7b3339e33af2a637da95e094b028a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ripatti"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
