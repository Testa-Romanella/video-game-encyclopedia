It's a totally common thing and not at all contrived, really!</p>\n<p>As the eponymous Snowbirder, it's up to you to move left and right to avoid obstacles on your snowboard. You can do this by pressing the A and D keys to move left and right respectively, it's on page one of the Snowbirder's manual! While you snowboard down the mountain, you can click on fast flying birds to take pictures of them, another Snowbirder basic. Of course, you'll need to have some film to take a picture, it seems our Snowbirder is taking it old school. Not to worry, you can pick up reels of film on the mountain, how convenient! Now get on your snowboard and take on the worlds greatest Snowbirding challenge!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the weekly game jam with the theme of \"downhill\". All art was made by me within GameMaker Studio 2 and all sound was taken from Freesound.org.
