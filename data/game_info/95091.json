Still, playing with a joystick is strongly recommended.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Movement: WASD Keys<br/>Jump / Accept: K key<br/>Attack / Return: I key<br/>Pet Attack: O key<br/>Start / Pause: Spacebar<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING: You MUST start a NEW GAME for this version (0.8)! Older savegames could crash the game.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fresh from the oven, beta demo v0.8!</strong><br/>Don't forget to visit our Indiegogo Campaign and support us to keep us alive and working!<br/><br/><strong>Check out the additions:</strong><br/><strong>Custom keyboard</strong>: Finally! Now you can configure the button layout however you prefer! Only available for keyboard though, but gamepad customization support is on its way! For now, we still recommend using an xbox controller.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>: A new menu option to show some of the basic moves you can perform! For those who, for some reason, don't try every possible button combination as soon as they start playing (I guess those people never rented cartridges from the videostore!).</p>\n<p><strong>Extra Checkpoint</strong>: We\u2019re adding a Checkpoint (or \"quick save\") system, after analyzing feedback from gameplay videos. There's only one now, between the Mud Apocalypse and Cybolab areas, but that's literally the hottest spot!<br/>With this we should be covering the most pressing issues with the beta demo, and we're sure it will make your experience smoother! Still, if you managed to finish the demo before these changes, let us know so we can\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before playing, have a look at the basic moves you'll be equipped with! It's quite some more than just jump and slash, so go ahead and try them!</p>\n<p> Don't be afraid to try every button combination, that's how we used to figure out things back then. That sense of discovery is awesome!<br/></p>\n<p>We would like to hear your feedback, so please contact us at\u00a0Facebook, Twitter\u00a0,\u00a0Tumblr, or email us at masteruomu@gmail.com.</p>\n<p>If you feel like buying a coffee to keep some newbie developers awake (and alive) while making this game, please check <strong>https://ko-fi.com/axerage\u00a0</strong> to give us a boost. We'd really really appreciate it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60f/60f2689cded1070d28ae8cc1f227380d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Master U.O.M.U."], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
