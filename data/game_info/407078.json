{"id": 407078, "slug": "xenogunner-official-demo", "name": "Xenogunner (Official Demo)", "name_original": "Xenogunner (Official Demo)", "description": "The story:\r\n<p>In the future year of 2011, Zeta Reak, kind, gentle king of the Xenolians, is overthrown by a powerful tyrant named the \"Xenogunner\".</p>\n<p>The Xenogunner is a mysterious being capable of many frightening feats, using a power known as \"Xenonature\", a powerful energy that grants one trained in the use of\u00a0it many elemental and non-elemental powers.</p>\n<p>Zeta, too, is capable of using Xenonature, as with most Xenolians. It's up to Zeta to overthrow the Xenogunner and reclaim the throne...</p>\n<p>...but is the Xenogunner actually the one pulling the strings...?</p>\n\r\nThe game:\r\n<p>Xenogunner is an intense boss-focused run-and-gun platformer based on games from the days of 16-bit consoles, with the addition of conveniences like mouse aiming and heavily customizable difficulty settings to slightly modernize things as well.</p>\n<p>The stages are short, the bosses are tough, and you get as many tries as you need to win... but that doesn't exactly make it easy. Don't take our word for it, you can try the demo to find out for yourself!</p>\n\r\nThe demo:\r\n<p>The demo includes 4 stages from part-way through the game (a bit less than half-way through), provided without story context.\u00a0It is focused entirely on showing off the gameplay, using content not featured in the GameJam release to avoid redundancy.</p>\n<p>It should have something in store\u00a0both for players who did play the GameJam version already and for people who only learned about the game afterwards.</p>\n<p>We really do hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>I didn't develop this game on my own! These people helped out with the project a ton, more than just through what they did directly for the project. That being said, here's the other people with which this game would have been impossible without them:</p>\n<p>ColonelSandwich:\u00a0https://twitter.com/SandwichColonel\u00a0(Did the music for the game)<br/>Pedrovin:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Pedrovinm\u00a0(Did the graphics for the game)<br/>Clickteam LLC:\u00a0https://twitter.com/clickteam (Publisher)</p>\n<p>Note that I\u00a0do not have control over the content of their Twitter pages and there could be content less appropriate for younger audiences than what you will find in this game.</p>\n\r\nWhat's changed?<br/>(Feel free to skip this if you didn't play the GameJam version):\r\n<p>I bet that any of you who played the GameJam version are wondering just what's changed this time around. Well, aside from generally polishing things up a bit and adding some more content, a lot of changes have been made:</p>\n<p>-Controller support!<br/><strong>NOTE:</strong> We\u00a0<strong>strongly</strong> recommend trying keyboard+mouse first if possible.</p>\n<p>-The weapons were completely rebalanced:\u00a0Now the game has 3 weapons instead of 6, with each of those weapons doing certain things a bit better than the weapons can.</p>\n<p>-Graphics and soundtrack upgraded/overhauled\u00a0significantly.<br/></p>\n<p>-Longer invulnerability frames! We set the default setting\u00a0higher for the demo, since these levels are from about half-way through the game and are rather tough otherwise... but \"mid\" is what they're like in the full game by default, if you're curious.</p>\n<p>-A\u00a0<em>greatly</em> expanded story with longer cutscenes, this time with pictures!<br/><strong>NOTE:</strong>\u00a0Demo does not include cutscenes or story.</p>\n<p>-More hidden secrets than the GameJam version!</p>\n<p>-...and much, much more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:21:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/337/3375bec491066ab7c81ae954732c1580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["happy_frog_games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
