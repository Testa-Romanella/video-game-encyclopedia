You do this by navigating the tunnels of your mind, exercising your hand-eye coordination while relishing in the funkadelic sights and sounds of your inner self. Collect the illuminated glyphs while avoiding the nasty obstacles. They may look all nice and shiny, even warm and inviting, but each brush with them brings you one step closer to eternal darkness! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBRAINPIPE is also an easy game to play, hearkening back to the classic arcade games of yesteryear. A simple interface along with steering with the analog stick keeps you focused on the action, instead of searching for the right button to press, and is a perfect complement to the soothing audio and visuals.<br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
