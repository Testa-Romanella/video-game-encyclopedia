Then run and jump into this fun new platformer game along with Randy and Teddy.<h3>Who are Randy and Teddy?</h3><br/>Hi, everybody, I\u2019m Randy. To be honest, I\u2019d rather skip the formalities and invite you to plunge straight into our world of adventures, but it is Teddy who insists on being formally introduced. So, this is my furry companion, Teddy. I know, I know, all fluffy and cuddly, he is the one who melts hearts and lights up faces. However, don\u2019t let this tail-wagger\u2019s sugary sweetness fool you. Appearances can be deceptive!<br/><br/>Since Teddy came into my life, fate has often taken me on odd journeys. With Teddy around, my life has become a constant shuffle between valuable work and unwanted distraction or, according to Teddy, between tediously boring business and great adventures.<h3>We invite you to join us as we are setting off on our quest.</h3><br/>We\u2019re always listening to community feedback and value what players are telling us. Randy and Teddy Adventure Road community helped steer the direction of development multiple times to make the game the best it can be. That will remain the same as we continue to improve, expand, and adjust Randy and Teddy Adventure Road based on community feedback post-launch.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fe/1fea8b412c5d9482c27ae6dd548fc728.jpg", "website": "https://randyandteddy.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nenad Mihajlovic", "Randy and Teddy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Blue Cloud PR"], "esrb_rating": null}
