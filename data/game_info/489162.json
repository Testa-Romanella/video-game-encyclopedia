Inspired by Balloon Fight, especially Balloon Trip - even if I realised (clearly) that the controls were more like Flappy Bird... This jam was fun, and gave me a reason to release something!</p>\n<p>I wanted to make a game that felt like one you'd play on a taxi or bus ride on the Game Boy, so nothing too complex. I actually never had a pure Game Boy - my first console was a Game Boy Color - but even so, I hope you enjoy this attempt to prod at nostalgia.\u00a0(I am aware the score font alias-es a little, and I could not figure out how to fix it. My apologies.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T07:02:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4e/b4e17d178fa2d5de507882b9b5535ba5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kururuchan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
