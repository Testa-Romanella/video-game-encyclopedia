{"id": 100642, "slug": "scribblehead", "name": "ScribbleHead", "name_original": "ScribbleHead", "description": "<p><strong>ScribbleHead</strong> is a stylized puzzle platformer where you play as an illustrated character who uses tools of his medium to avoid or sneak past obstacles and enemies.</p><p>In ScribbleHead the player must move from the left side of the map to the right side in order to proceed. Each level is made up of a series of discrete yet interconnected puzzles and challenges that incorporate two main mechanics for the player to use.</p><p>The first allows the character to draw himself onto chalkboards to avoid the enemies and obstacles that inhabit the \"3D\" foreground, while the second allows the character to leave a rough sketch of himself behind which he can then teleport back to at any time by erasing himself.</p><p>ScribbleHead can't jump, so you'll have to use timing and strategy to overcome each puzzle. Good luck!</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Everything by: Josh Burak, Ben Codrington, and Kat Pinto</p><p>Controls:</p><p><strong>A,D</strong>: walk left/right</p><p><strong>J</strong>: chalk</p><p><strong>K</strong>: sketch</p><p><strong>L</strong>: restart level</p><p><strong>S</strong>: interact</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e65/e65578bf50ccbee67f755182a80ff2c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ProjectBench"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
