With the prompt \"Everything Is Not As It Seems\", I got to work and made this!</p>\n<p>Perspective is an endless runner where you have to dodge obstacles. Sounds simple enough, but you are never completely sure what obstacle it is nor where it is. Thankfully you have your two perspectives, the x-axis and the y-axis, both there to guide you to as a high a score as possible.</p>\n<p>The controls are simple, use W and S to move up and down or to jump and duck (depending on your perspective). You can click either perspective to choose which perspective you want to use, or easily switch between them with the TAB key. The game has no quit button unfortunately, but an easy Alt+F4 works wonders in its absence!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c9acc5b0afc91c55c37197b1220113a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noxyper"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
