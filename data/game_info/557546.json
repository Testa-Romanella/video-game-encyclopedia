The player can collect upgrades to give them more moves and also is required to collect power before they can complete the level.</p>\n<p>The player cant move back over any tile they have already moved on so they need to be careful in their movements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player also need to avoid being hit by enemies otherwise they will need to restart the level. They can block the enemy though it they block it in with the cord.</p>\n<p>Art &amp; Music by:\u00a0https://twitter.com/artisticcarcras?lang=en</p>\n<p>Programmed By:\u00a0https://twitter.com/BrockMorePixels</p>\n<p>Sounds From:</p>\n\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/harrietniamh/sounds/415079/ - Death Sound<br/>https://freesound.org/people/bantha%20brain/sounds/44498/ - Movement Sound<br/>https://freesound.org/people/elijahdanie/sounds/487436/ - Level Complete Sound<br/>https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/sounds/270304/ - Pickup Sound<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T10:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e82/e8289e6e8c0018776810d7854c1c1454.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MorePixelStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
