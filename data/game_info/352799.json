Your goal is to steal a cookie hidden somewhere (usually a kitchen) and bring it back to your room. Avoid being seen by parents, siblings and classmates. Use various tools in your environment to distract them or to hide.\r\nThis game plays sort of like hotline miami, minus the blood and guts (sadly).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T09:59:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e465ff9b1029842cde56973514945215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Herald"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
