While money is an obstacle, a full release is not currently realistic because I lack the connections to find artists, composers, voice actors etc. etc. in order to fully realize my vision and I lack the various skillsets I would require \u00a0to create it alone.</p><p>Logo designed using designevo.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:34:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/795/7952e5f0c9df8b7d14a47d3a80f2e751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gothlolilunatic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
