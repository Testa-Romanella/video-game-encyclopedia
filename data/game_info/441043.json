You play as a small ball that has to go through 20 levels. The essence of each of the levels is to get to the portal by platform. If you think it's easy just try it! Various and difficult levels will not let you get bored. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T06:23:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbb/fbb52143a27e8aecd24f0c4854ef333f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["imartin_ff"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
