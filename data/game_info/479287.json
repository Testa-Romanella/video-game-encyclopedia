I MEAN my biggest game on unity which I spent longer on was only 30mb. This was(until I started trying different ways of compressing it and saving space) OVER 1.3GB!\u00a0I was so scared I wouldn't be able to upload this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I must say sorry for making it a rar file.\u00a0I know most would prefer zip files however this was the only way I could get it to compress better.</p><p>This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2020\u00a0July-August Which lasted for a week. The theme of it being 'Rewind'.</p>\n<p>----------------</p>\n\n<strong>This is also my first take on horror</strong>\n<p>I would've loved to have done more however, due to my own limits I was only able to get this much. I really wanted to try to create that eerie feeling not all the jump scares and what not. I really wanted you to leave with a not in your stomach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So please, tell me how I did?</p>\n\n<p>----------------</p>\r\nAssets\r\n<p>Most of the assets came from the Epic Games Store,\u00a0they really are high quality. Maybe a bit too high.</p>\n<p>I also used sound assets from OpenGameArt</p>\r\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/dark-ambient-loop-13\r\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/dark-intro\r\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/dark-ambient-0\r\n\n<p>----------------<br/></p>\r\nFurther development?\r\n<p>Probably not, I am predicting that I'm about to be quite busy and even if I wanted to, the file is very nearing the edge of the 1gb limit.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>----------------<br/></p>\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n<p>I'm probably going to try to develop more stuff in Unreal Engine 4(and 5 when it releases) and do more blender stuff now:D.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed the game be sure to share it and comment any praises and criticisms.</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>\r\nGame play\r\n\r\n<p>The game play is a simple exploration and search for clues type game. One that tries to make it more eerie as you explore and lead to very unsatisfying endings.</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>Fear not, for there is a how to play screen in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:12:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d0/7d0558071c6f6c5e30f81841d4dbbb76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tanicorn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
