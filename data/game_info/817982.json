You can rotate in any axis, push off surfaces, grab and climb, or attach yourself to a floor or wall and walk with 360 locomotion.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCheck out the early access section to read about the road map, there's lots more to come.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T04:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d6790fa7bb98735441f4b5da37a5103f.jpg", "website": "https://inchoate-elk.com/nonfingo.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inchoate Elk"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Inchoate Elk"], "esrb_rating": null}
