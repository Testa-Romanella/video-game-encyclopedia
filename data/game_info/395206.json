Bid on jobs, buy dozers, backhoes, excavators, and scrapers, then put them to work. Build slowly or borrow your way to the top! There is no free lunch served at the job site.

Dave's business is to provide earthwork estimates to construction contractors. He had also been working on a gaming model to describe the free-wheeling earthwork construction business when he stumbled across THE FARMING GAME. He was so impressed with the business gaming model contained within THE FARMING GAME, he contacted the inventor, George Rohrbacher, and asked George, if through a licensing agreement, that he might be able to adapt THE FARMING GAME to the construction business. After some wrangling, the two struck a deal and in 1993 THE CONSTRUCTION GAME hit the market. Praises for the new game came in from all over the world and the game orders swamped Dave's engineering office that first Christmas. Dave was soon forced to choose between his first love, earthwork engineering, and the game business. Some years later, George and Dave struck another deal and THE CONSTRUCTION GAME became the property of The Weekend Farmer Co., George's game company. Preparing to manufacture THE CONSTRUCTION GAME in the new library-sized box, George and Ann Rohrbacher treated the game like they'd acquired a classic automobile. They stripped THE CONSTRUCTION GAME down to its chaise and then rebuilt it lovingly, piece by piece, to their exacting factory specifications. The result, as you are soon to see, is one of the best games you'll ever play. A close relative of THE FARMING GAME, to be sure, but THE CONSTRUCTION GAME is no clone! It stands on its own, a raucous good time - a hoot-and-a-half! Enjoy!!!
