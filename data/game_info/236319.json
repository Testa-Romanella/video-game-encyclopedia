Many of them were about me trying to learn specifics of coding and experimenting designs that were too weird to continue development, while trying to make something funny with it. These projects were actually made two years ago, and it was part of my plan to take this long to go back to them, make them presentable and release them to the public here.</p>\n<p>Number 5 is called When The Catholic Girls Go Camping, The Nicotine Vampires Rules Supreme. It's inspired by the song with the same name by Giraffes? Giraffes!<strong>. </strong>This is the first of many others\u00a0<strong>Troll Games</strong> I went on to make in this class! The theme for the week was \"Trying\", so I thought: <strong>\"Why not a game where the whole game is to try and play the game?\"</strong></p>\n<p>In this game, all you have to do is <strong>c</strong><strong>lick around the menus and check for hints.</strong> Then maybe you can click New Game and enjoy some intense gameplay.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I didn't do, nor I claim to own, any of the music and art in this game,</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b9893ec49ee2c507c81b160bc44ace55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mauriciojuliano"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
