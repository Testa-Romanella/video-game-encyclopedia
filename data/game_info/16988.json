Eisenhower, US Forces have driven ashore on the bloody beaches of Normandy and fought their way deep into Europe driving back the German war machine.  Now battle fatigued and spread out on enemy soil, an army made of citizen soldiers are pitted against a battle-hardened professional military with over four years\u2019 experience. Facing the best Germany has to offer, the US Forces fight desperately and viciously to expand the frontlines.<br />\nAn adaptable army that will bend but not break, the US Forces draws on some extremely versatile infantry and vehicles, while the unique base structure of the army captures the temporary nature of the frontlines. Fast light and medium armored vehicles, like the iconic M4A3 Sherman, provide mobile firepower to support versatile Riflemen, while elite Paratroopers and airpower disrupt enemy plans well behind the front lines.<br />\nKEY FEATURESUS FORCES<br />\nWield the mighty power of Eisenhower\u2019s Allied army with brand new abilities and strategies<br />\nTHE WESTERN FRONT<br />\nExpand the war to the popular Western Front theater of combat, featuring breathtaking new environments, that bring realism and vibrancy never before seen in the game<br />\nNEW MAPS<br />\nEight stunning new maps join the extensive collection of 23 existing Company of Heroes 2 maps as well as over 1,000 community created maps available on the Steam workshop<br />\nINTENSE ONLINE COMBAT<br />\nFeel the unprecedented ferocity of frontline strategic warfare and engage in visceral battle with adversaries across the globe<br />\nEVERY BATTLE TELLS A STORY<br />\nExperience the up-close moment-to-moment brutality of frontline warfare and control the battle through your military prowessUSF vs OTHER COH2 MULTIPLAYER ARMIESFind out the multiplayer army (and associated game/standalone) that suits your play style.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-04T10:23:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0eb/0eb39ace46e88739eb0395631c9cb57c.jpg", "website": "http://www.companyofheroes.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 640, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "Relic Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Feral Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
