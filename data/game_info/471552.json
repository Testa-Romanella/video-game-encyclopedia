Show off your mouse skills by holding out as long as you can against an almost infallible opponent.<br/></p>\n<p>Instead of been a regular match, the speed of the ball is scored on each stroke. Score grows exponentially with ball speed. Accumulate as many points as you can and climb to the top of the local scoreboard. <br/></p>\n<p>Each match begins with two lives. They will be lost by throwing the ball off the court or by hitting the net. You will get a chance to get them back by bouncing the ball over the flashing areas on the field, as shown in the third screenshot. Live restoring opportunities will be scarce over time.</p>\n<p>Thanks for trying it out and enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Effect</strong><br/>Mouse movement<br/>Racquet position control<br/>Mouse buttons<br/>Ball kick / Ball spin control<br/><br/>Escape key<br/>Exit game<br/><br/>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Windows XP or higher</li><li>DirectX9c capable graphic card</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T04:15:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c43/c4395660b8cb4212d122ca1e69651328.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["txes"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
