It offers 1 type of car to get hijacked by. It offers 1000* guns. It offers zero exciting missions to do in a small, un-sprawling cityscape.</p><p>(serious notes: There are probably lots of bugs/ things that make no sense that I haven't caught in development. Direct any concerns/complaints to @thewaether on twitter. This was made in Blitz3d, which is why it's a downloadable. There is no sound at all.)</p><p>*1</p><p><em>UPDATED ON 10/08/16: PATCH NOTES:</em></p><ol><li><em>Removed a crappy conversation with the video game store clerk that I hated &amp;  haunted my dreams with how bad it was<br/></em></li><li><em>Changed a sign</em></li><li><em>Opening Cutscene doesn't take exorbitantly long time</em></li><li><em>Old version is still on-site, but just hidden.
