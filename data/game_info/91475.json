AKA Demo or Die, AKA the demo is finally out.</p><p>In this version, we have two preview scenes available for you to choose from: Mesmer and the Host.</p><p>Mesmer's scene reunites two long separated childhood friends, with a lot having changed in the years between. The Host's scene is an intense power struggle between hero and villain, charged with sexual tension.</p><p>The demo is still rough around the edges - using Ren'Py's default fonts and menus, for one. Our plan is to update it, adding in a new scene for each character over time. We'd like to make the development process open and transparent, so you can learn along with us! This also lets us get valuable feedback from you while we work on the full game. </p><p>Please enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55f/55f32d9bbf6e37a0d95120e33f9777de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Arden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
