It's inspired by the GSC Pok\u00e9mon slot machines. I've included all the assets and Game Maker Studio 1 files in the download. I'm still a beginner programmer so the code probably isn't great but i'm pretty sure there are no bugs. The game\u00a0should work fine on mobile devices but please let me know if it doesn't work on yours.</p>\n<p>You can time the last reel so there's a bit of skill involved. Don't worry about running out of credit, it'll just go into the negative.<br/></p>\n<p>Z = play / stop wheels</p>\n<p>X = payout</p>\n\n\n<p>If you want to support me, please take a look at my assets!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T17:05:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0f/e0fa87676086408f4969448873bf0272.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GibbonGL"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
