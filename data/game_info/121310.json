You play as Zaid's inner self where you HAVE TO FIND WISDOM within himself in the form of Quranic verses or hadith.</p><p>The idea of this game came from our observation where children within the range of 9-12 years old prefer games that is quick and easy to grasp. So instead of creating a full educational game, we make education as part of the game.<br/></p><p>This game is still in development, there are still missing elements such as instructions, lose animations, and some bugs.</p><p>This is the first game that i developed with my friend, Wan Mohd Aizat, where I am the developer and he is the designer.</p><p>Only compatible on 1280x720.<br/></p><p>Instructions :</p><p>1. Press A &amp; D to move left and right.</p><p>2. Press SPACE to jump, and press SPACE again while jumping to perform double jump.</p><p>4. Must find wisdom in order to unlock the endpoint.</p><p>5. When you're dead, you will restart at the start point.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e70/e7072f61564e3446bdb3839907084534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Rahmat"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
