Aside from space constraints, the player will have a limited amount of water, sunlight, and minerals to allocate. They will have an initial stock of seeds to choose from, however each successive harvest will produce slightly mutated seeds. To excel, the player will choose the best seeds from each generation to move forward, perhaps one that requires less water as an example.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T23:20:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/8537f60a4373d1a026bf182262c954f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["kingmeofme"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
