In order to return and gain the king's pardon, he must venture Al-Andalus in search of gold and riches to bring to his former country.</p>\n<p>More info<br/></p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<p><strong>LMB </strong>- Attack</p>\n<p><strong>RMB </strong>- Move</p>\n<p><strong>Q </strong>- Block/Parry</p>\n<p>If you block at the right moment you'll do a parry and the enemy will get stunned for longer.<br/></p>\n<strong>Notes:</strong>\n<p>We strongly recommend to download the game to play it, it seems to have minor bugs in the browser. <br/></p>\n<p>When loading levels it will seem to crash, just wait for the game to catch up it's some bug we haven't figured out yet.</p>\n<p>The game isn't finished, plus even if we would love to finish it we are finding ourselves unable to do it for this jam. Since we are resuming our studies soon we will not update in a while. But keep in mind we will finish this, I swear!<br/></p>\n<strong>The Team:</strong>\n<p>In this game we've partaken Edgelord and Tortitas. Most of the hard visual design is not ours as the credits section shows, but we've worked really hard on this project. The game has been made in Unity 2020 and it's the first game I make as a programmer with a bigger scope and posibilities of actually finishing it. Music has been done by Edgelord with Musescore, FLStudio and much videogame music experience.<br/></p>\n<strong>Credits:</strong>\n<p>Music, some tilesets, 2\u00ba and 4\u00ba castle - Sr. Edgelord<br/></p>\n<p>Sandstone ornament -\u00a0qubodup | https://opengameart.org/content/sandstone-ornament-256px</p>\n<p>Mouse cursor - Jinn | https://opengameart.org/content/dwarven-cursor<br/></p>\n<p>Tiles - Clint Bellanger, Lamoot, Blender Foundation | apricot.blender.org, lattice, p0ss, Bart K. | OpenGameArt.org, Sindwiller | https://opengameart.org/content/grassland-tileset<br/></p>\n<p>Many sprites - Heavily based on Diablo2 property of Blizzard Entertainment Inc.</p>\n<p>More tiles - p0ss | https://opengameart.org/content/isometric-tile-starter-pack</p>\n<p>Walls - Hansj\u00f6rg Malthaner | http://opengameart.org/users/varkalandar</p>\n<p>Finish Door - Lukas K\u00fcstenmacher | https://opengameart.org/content/isometric-tileset-gothic-archways</p>\n<p>Map images - MELLE | https://opengameart.org/content/simple-map-tiles</p>\n<p>UI - Lamoot | https://opengameart.org/content/rpg-gui-construction-kit-v10</p>\n<p>Potions - BizmasterStudios | https://opengameart.org/content/potion-icons-from-pixeltime-videos</p>\n<p>Code, dungeons and some tilesets - Tortitas<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:56:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfa91950fb607755d730f9ec736ed0d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Tortitas"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
