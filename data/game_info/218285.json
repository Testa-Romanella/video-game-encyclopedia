{"id": 218285, "slug": "moonlight-mahjong", "name": "Moonlight Mahjong", "name_original": "Moonlight Mahjong", "description": "The popular 3D Mahjong Solitaire game created for the iPhone and iPad now comes to the Mac. Play arcade-style with progressively difficult levels, or relax with one of the non-competitive game modes. The gameplay is simple yet addictive. <br/><br/>Originally created for touch-screen iOS devices, Moonlight Mahjong on the Mac takes full advantage of a multitouch trackpad, but also can be played with a mouse. Intuitive control allows you to tilt and turn in virtual reality, allowing you to more easily see the tiles on the board.<br/><br/>Moonlight Mahjong on the Mac features four types of play:<br/><br/>Scramble Mode (the default): Make matches faster than the automated opponent \"Tilebot\" through increasingly difficult levels. The board is automatically reshuffled when you run out of matches, making this game mode easy (to start!) and fun.<br/><br/>Challenge Mode: Compete against Tilebot in full puzzle mode, with no automatic reshuffling, only undo. Challenge requires more strategy than Scramble.<br/><br/>Puzzle Mode: Solve puzzle boards with no time limit. Choose any layouts you like; no high scores.<br/><br/>Relaxation Mode: Clear boards with no time limit and automatic reshuffle when out of matches. Perfect for when you're just not in the mood to strategize or rush.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T09:17:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/801e9ee7a6e87f75575029f5a878b2b9.jpg", "website": "http://moonlightmahjong.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Midnight Martian"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Michael Howard"], "esrb_rating": null}
