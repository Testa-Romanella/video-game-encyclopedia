Why not with games?<br/><br/>You have to escape from the Bad Guys and go as far as you can. Collect all the good things in your way.<br/><br/>Weird Smile is a minimalistic game where you interact with 6 kinds of characters:<br/><br/>- Weird Hero: it is the main character of the game. You have to get him as far as you can<br/>- Bad Guys: they are the enemies and you have to avoid them<br/>- Coins: with these you can upgrade powers, resurrect and get more lives and boosters<br/><br/>- Booster: By taking it you become a Bad-Guy eater until the time of the bonus ends<br/>- Collector: When you take it, all the coins will automatically be attracted to your character. If you combine with booster too, then all what you should do is relax and wait to eat all the bad guys<br/>- Resizer: When you take it you will become smaller, so it will be much easier to avoid bad guys<br/><br/><br/>There is a dedicated page to see your achievements that are shared and displayed also in the Game Center<br/><br/>So, what are you waiting for???
