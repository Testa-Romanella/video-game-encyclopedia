Lumencraft is a top-down shooter with base-building elements in which you drill through fully destructible environment to reach precious resources and spend them on weapons and tools protecting the last bastion of humanity.<br />\nKEY FEATURES<br />\nBECOME SAVIOUR OF MANKIND<br />\nThe year 2221: More than two centuries ago, the surface of the planet became uninhabitable. The remnants of humanity struggle to survive without electricity and light. Dreams of a better future died long ago, but a recently discovered mineral has brought a spark of hope. Lumen, a crystal with high energy potency, may be the last chance for a struggling civilization. Scouts, brave miners, have been sent underground to a settlement near the Lumen deposits. New scouts continue to join this mission, but so far, no one has returned. It seems that the darkness of the underground holds more than just natural riches...<br />\nDRILL YOUR WAY TO VICTORY<br />\nFight for your survival. Enemies are going to raid your base so be careful and leave some turrets on the watch.<br />\nDefending the underground settlement by direct combat and the use of diversified turrets.<br />\nHighly efficient and satisfying digging mechanics.<br />\nExplosive weapons. Yes, we have dynamite.<br />\nEXPLORE FULLY DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENT<br />\nWith a lot of effort and a set of original algorithms, 2Dynamic Games have transformed the open-source Godot Engine into a completely new tool. This allows every bit of terrain (pixel, as we used to call them) to be destroyed, and maps can be painted as if in a drawing program. What\u2019s more?<br />\nDynamic lights and pixel-perfect interaction with the fully destructible terrain.<br />\nDread atmosphere created through the impactful sound design and a unique 2Dynamic lighting system.<br />\nRealistic simulations. Just look at the lava!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-29T18:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b8/7b8c45ca93d1b50e3344da7fb0158f2a.jpg", "website": "https://lumencraft-game.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 37, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 10, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 71, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 410, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["2Dynamic Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Star Drifters", "Surefire.Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
