But maybe Vlad doesn't have to be so sad?</p>\n<p>In this game, you'll play as Vlad as he lives his daily life in the city. Each week, you'll get to visit two locations of your choice (you can't visit the same location twice in any given week).</p>\n<p>There are two endings you can get in this game.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: Fixed some grammar mistakes, changed some dialogue, made location selection more noticeable, and added a main menu</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who worked on this project!</p>\n<p>Programmer:\u00a0Sarah Lester - sarahsalad</p>\n<p>Programmer, Music:\u00a0Connor Davis - poisonphang</p>\n<p>Artist: Andrew Lester - Vibratix Art</p>\n<p>Follow Vibratix Art on social media!</p>\n<p>Instagram<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter<br/></p>\n<p>Facebook<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaf/aaf89fbae157df3ac51fe26e37139ec3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["sarahsalad"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
