You return your \"dialog card\" to farther the conversation. (All NPC should act this way.)\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0-&gt; Somehow, I can't collect the seocond gold bar the one where you go downstairs in the first house\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nThe second gold bar is the stashed gold from what you picked up upstairs. (If you return to this spot later you can watch it accumulate there.\r\n<ul><li>-&gt; Sprint (Shift only) is sometimes breaking I guess? Provides a small speed increase and then poof gone\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nThis is a Stamina system hidden by the fact the UI is still in developement. Your Dash also has it's own stamina system.\r\n<ul><li>-&gt; Can't scroll with mouse wheel\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nIts press / not scroll. This is for your Dash. \"Zoom zoom\" Bad Pun in Tab Menu.\r\n<ul><li>-&gt; If I crouch and go inside a hut(which is too small) , I can stand up tall again when inside\r\nImprovements\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nA ceiling check for the player\u00a0is half written.\r\n<ul><li>-&gt;The sound on the blue lighting hut is a bit weird.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nIts press / not scroll. This is for your Dash. \"Zoom zoom\" Bad Pun in Tab Menu.\r\n<ul><li>-&gt; Some huts have 0 lighting.</li></ul>\r\nOnly buildings that have seen attention have been lit.\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0-&gt; A tree by the pier is hanging in the air :P\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nJust one?\r\n<ul><li>-&gt; Need some activity in the village. (ignore this one if you already have it planned)\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nAlready planned.\r\n<ul><li>-&gt; More grass (imo, but I'm not that good at atmosphere )\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nOnly a tenth of the trees have been placed. So its a work in progress.\r\n<ul><li>-&gt; The random  \"fireflies\" im guessing is the term, are appearing in small translucent boxes. If the boxes are intended, make the boxes smaller imo</li></ul>\r\nHalf - ass implemented..
