Fascinating trajectories drawn by a pendulum. \"Swing Solver\" is an easy yet profound physics action puzzle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Easy yet profound action using swing. All you need to do is click and release. But the actions are infinite! </li></ul><ul><li> Acceleration tiles, moving platforms, warp gates, and other obstacles that can drastically alter the ball's movement. If you can't control them, you'll hit a saw! </li></ul><ul><li> Replays show the beautiful trajectory drawn by the pendulum after each success. The cooler the success, the more beautiful the trajectory! </li></ul><ul><li> Simple graphics highlight the beautiful orbit of the pendulum. The world made of blue squares and round balls looks like a physics notebook. </li></ul><ul><li> Calm sounds that match the graphics. </li></ul><br/>The only actions used are firing and disconnecting the wire. It is a simple operation, but difficult to master. Where do you connect the wire? When to disconnect? Watch the movement of the pendulum and control the ball perfectly with a single wire!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T06:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c06b1ef30b353f6612ad84f350b76b73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rockoishi Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rockoishi Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
