Due to my inexperience at the time, however, the maze has to be completely redrawn with every step, resulting in a lot of flickering as hundreds of characters are deleted and redrawn.</p>\n<p>Well... it's a feature, not a bug, ok?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T06:31:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/104/104587b8db9c9c8b977dbd2f9e5f489d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunarium Works"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
