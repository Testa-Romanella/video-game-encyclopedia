It's a bit buggy every no-and-then being that you might have a rock spawn on your cube after collecting food. I'm not sure how to fix that yet, but I think it's a fun and simple game. I'm going to look into the 3D side of things now. Enjoy! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T08:31:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db7/db79fa34149b04a5fee58e72704e7140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeepDownGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
