By doing that, you disturbed the Gods' nap, and they are now furious at you. To calm them down, they asked you to turn some things real thanks to the obelisks in the maze. <br/>It is a short game, but repeatable because everything is generated randomly so you won't play twice the same game : the goal and the maze change everytime.\u00a0<br/>This game was developed for the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1 with the theme \"it is not real\" and\u00a0i made it solo in 6 days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:47:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c18/c18fc5d629c793565d5199537de6f792.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixTrick"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
