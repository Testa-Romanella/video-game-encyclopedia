The greatest attraction is the fact that there \n      exist an unlimited number of set sequences known as \"theorems\". With \n      this puzzle, you can actually feel your own skill level rising with each \n      theorem you learn. To ensure your long-term enjoyment, we're prepared \n      both a \"Stage Clear\" mode and a \"Random\" mode. In \"Stage Clear\" mode, \n      you progress by clearing puzzles one by one, and in \"Random\" mode \n      puzzles are generated at random. Please enjoy this high-quality \n      \"Slitherlink\" game.\n    </p><p>\n      50 Slitherlink questions are collected. In this - one of Nikoli's most \n      awesome original puzzles - you connect the dots to make a single ring.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7b/d7bfa6cb7873669e270cf95463ca7235.jpg", "website": "http://www.hamster.co.jp/american_hamster/products/soft.cgi?3ds&enjc3j", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["HAMSTER", "Co."], "esrb_rating": null}
