Their home planet experienced an apocalyptic event involving pollution of toxic gas, rendering it uninhabitable. The outlaw orbits their home planet, seeking out for the last remaining resources in its crust. The outlaw recruits crew members with varying professions, and together, they aid in each others\u2019 survival.<br/><br/>Welcome to the ship - a kind of grungy looking and dirty ship made of rough and rusty metal, with some computer terminals in the walls, and numerous damage features. This is your home, and you are alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The atmosphere of the game begins as quite dire and a poor state of affairs. Repairs are needed, upgrades are missing, and whole parts of the ship have been destroyed and are now missing - the engines included!</p>\n<p>The giant space beast who decided to attach itself to the hull where the engines used to be now leers at the crew as it periodically demands to be fed or unleash its wrath. It\u2019s a gloomy situation, but presents an interesting challenge. So, can you get your crew out of this mess?</p>\n<p>The Game begins when the player finds themselves alone on the space-wagon, running out of food for the space-beast, and the ship is beginning to break down. Their only option is to go down to the planet and try to scavenge resources and food.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player starts the game with the 4 core ship stations that are needed throughout the game, and 6 other station types can be added later. A number of these stations must be worked by one or more crewmates in order for them to provide their benefits, while some, such as the Med-Bay and the Barista Station, can be visited when their benefits are needed.</p>\n<p>The Player receives a random amount of resources and food and must decide how to best utilize it in order to both keep the ship running, and to feed the space-beast.</p>\n<p>After the first or second mission enough resources have been collected in order to start making upgrades to the ship.</p>\n<p>Eventually the player can make so many upgrades to the ship that it becomes able to repair and maintain itself as well as feed the beast for the player, at which point the spaceship is able to break free of the space-beast\u2019s control and the game is won.<br/></p>\n<p>To win the game, the player must work to progressively repair and expand the ship, collecting resources from the planet to upgrade the ship and enough food to feed the space beast and the crew. Eventually with proper micromanagement and decision making, the player will reach the final goal of the game: To rebuild the ship\u2019s engines and finally escape the space beast.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T05:58:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e3d71e9efa288a8a224bf2ed7f4b0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamMeme"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
