The dungeon is procedurally generated upon each play so never play the same dungeon twice!</p>\n<p><strong>Features:<br/></strong>A 2D procedural dungeon game. The design team built out an environment generation prototype. The system does the\u00a0following:</p>\n<ul><li>Rooms vary in size and shape with a minimum of 4 different room types mixing together.\r\n</li><li>There are branching paths through the dungeon with potential for dead ends and backtracking.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>There will be one boss room per dungeon.\r\n</li><li>Rooms have placeholder treasure, traps, and/or monsters.\r\n</li><li>There is a player character with\u00a0movement mechanics to navigate the environment.\r\n</li><li>The camera behaves differently based on the size of the room. (i.e small rooms have static camera, long rooms have panning camera, large rooms have moving camera bounded to the size of the room, etc). The camera shows as little of the surrounding rooms as possible.<br/>\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tech Artists:</strong><br/>Remus Wong<br/>Jaclyn Ngo<br/>Maddy Fisher<br/>Nada A.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:54:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e172a9c9ddf199798d2e64bd0373479b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jaclyn Ngo", "Romulus2100", "Omzagee", "Madeline Fisher Games and Prototypes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
