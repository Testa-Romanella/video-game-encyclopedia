The theme was: It is not real.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You have been kidnapped by the evil Mimic! He threw you in his dungeon, but you are able to walk, so walk out of here! But be careful: the Mimic has a weird sense of humour and diguised his minions as random objects. Play his sick game mix of Prop Hunt and Escape Room to save yourself!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Mimic has hidden all the objects you need in order to escape. Find all 3 parts of the Teleportation Crystal and get the hell out of there!</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The player controls the avatar. The goal is to find all 3 Crystal Parts. They are disguised as other objects in the Levels. The player is given clues about their disguise. Solve the riddle and get the crystals.</p>\n<p>We recommend playing the game in fullscreen mode.</p>\r\nControls\u00a0\r\n<p>Up &gt;&gt; W/Arrow Up</p>\n<p>Down &gt;&gt; S/Arrow Down</p>\n<p>Left &gt;&gt; A/Arrow Left</p>\n<p>Interact &gt;&gt; E</p>\n<p>Pause &gt;&gt; Space</p>\n\r\nTeam members and Contributions\r\n<p>Jamie Fuchs: Programming, Unity Implementation, Visual Design and 2D Art</p>\n<p>Matthias Niedertscheider:\u00a0Level Design, Unity Implementation, Sounds, Dialoges</p>\n<p>Suvad Catic:\u00a0Level Design, Unity Implementation, Sounds<br/></p>\n<p>Beatrice Fuchs: Visual Design and 2D Art, Animations, Programming, Unity Implementation</p>\n<p>Thomas Gy\u00f6rgyfalvay: Score</p>\n\r\nReferences\r\nSound References\r\n<p>Door Locked - https://opengameart.org/content/door-lock-sounds\u00a0</p>\n<p>Door Unlocked - https://opengameart.org/content/door-lock-sounds</p>\n<p>Enemy Spawn - https://opengameart.org/content/zombie-skeleton-monster-voice-effects\u00a0</p>\n<p>Death - https://opengameart.org/content/death-sounds-0</p>\n<p>Pickup - https://opengameart.org/content/inventory-sound-effects</p>\n\r\nCode References\r\n<p>AStar Pathfinding -\u00a0\u00a0https://arongranberg.com/astar/documentation/dev_4_3_8_84e2f938/old/pathfinding-...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/93876abb65f2a056dc4cf56262ebc8fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BashFuchs", "JamieWindfox", "NiasWritings", "Sudo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
