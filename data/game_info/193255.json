This is a short point and click, first person adventure in which you, as the player, has to explore the game world and find out what is going on. The prototype demonstrates the functionality that would be present in the fuller version, but only shows a small fragment of the world and story of the game. <br/></p><p>I would like to carry on developing this idea after the assessment period is over but I would need help in improving the graphics from the purely representational art I've used. Please play and let me know what you think. </p><p>[Updated 20/04/17 to add credits to end screen]<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a51da5c438fa2f13e9258a815aa60c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Stokoe"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
