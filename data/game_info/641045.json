Man, the peak of the evolution of nature will die in 70 years, a hawk proudly hovering in the sky in 25, a horse galloping across the fields in 20, a toad in 5, the mayfly already tonight, and, well this world ... will perish in a couple of minutes. However, there are always those who resist the law, those who dared to oppose their fate by absorbing the souls of others to extend their worthless life. So rise on the wreckage of reality, Reaper, the guardian of the order of this world, and show the fools their place ... in the underworld.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Well, you have heard this epic story many times at grim lessons, and as a child, while still a little reaper, you repeated it in your head with great inspiration, imagining how working towards Death itself, you mow down crowds of enemies with one sweep of your scythe. Striving for this, the young doomsayer studied tirelessly, becoming one of the best among his own. However, that was in the past. Studying the history of a vanished world, you discovered the greatest legacy of mankind - video games, after which you locked yourself in your room aaand... became an otaku. Yes, such is the fate of a genius who once showed such great promise. Time passed and the games played became more and more, and the money became less and less: food, mortgage, light, as well as constant spending in the donation shop made you bankrupt and now you have to finally leave your room and take your first order - the murder of an ancient vampire.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Control:</li><li>\u00a0WASD - moving\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0Shift \u2013 dash</li><li>\u00a0LMB \u2013 attack</li><li>\u00a0RMB \u2013 magic attack</li><li>\u00a0Q - scythe/guns switch</li><li>\u00a01, 2, 3, 4 \u2013 Guns (pistol, shotgun, machinegun, submachine gun)</li><li>\u00a0\r\nYour weapons and magic spend mana, keep an eye on its indicator, since when your mana supply runs out, you will pay with health for using these abilities.
