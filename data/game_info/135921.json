No looking back!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The catch? As you go down, crystals will freeze into platforms that you'll need to climb your way to the goal, so don't be too greedy ;)<br/>To assist you a bit you can also count on a booster powerup that will give you some extra impulse at a small cost (3 crystals).<br/></p>Controls\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Left/Right arrow (A/D):\u00a0Move horizontally.</li><li>Space:\u00a0Jump</li><li>Left control:\u00a0Boost!

(Not the MAC version, sorry!)<br/>I've also improved this page :)</li></ul>Known issues<ul><li>Sometimes the booster skill gets stuck, and releasing it won't do anything, but you'll still see the \"ready\" feedback. If that happens, try to hold and release again.\u00a0</li><li>The current\u00a0 resolution\u00a0 I chose (540x960) is too high for the Itch page, my bad! I'll try to generate a build for a different resolutions, but in the meantime you can just zoom the browser to around 50-75%, whatever feels more comfortable.
