I'm not new to programming, but I am still new to game developing in particular. I speak English, Dutch, French, Japanese and understand Spanish. I have programming experience in C, C++, C#, Java and Eiffel. My favourite kind of games are story driven RPG's (any kind), and well written visual novels, in other words: games with a fantastic story. But this doesn't mean that I can't enjoy games of other genres or without a good story.</p><p>This current project is being developed with  Monogame in C#.
