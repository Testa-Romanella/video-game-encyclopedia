The main idea was to steal the time cycle idea from Zelda: Majora's Mask, with a doomsday event forcing the player to \"start with nothing\" again every day. I thought it was a cool idea, but I think I was too ambitious with the variety of quests and mechanics, so I didn't end up finishing.</p>\n<p>You can load this up and explore though, many of the quests should be doable. The ones involving music do not work well, and the festival at the end is unimplemented.<br/></p>\n<p>## Credit</p>\n<p>- Some helper scripts taken from another LD game of mine, FEED: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/$81974<br/>- Font: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/leander?q%5Bterm%5D=pirate&amp;q%5Bsearch_check%5...<br/>- Followed this idea for making a LWRP cel shader:<br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a0nohidea\u00a0idk\u00a0pack used for drum samples: https://sellfy.com/p/7sz6/<br/>- parts of the music were made with Serum VST: https://xferrecords.com/products/serum/</p>\n<p>\u26f5<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T06:38:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d416c5c73aa61c0935ce9640b76b3f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zre"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
