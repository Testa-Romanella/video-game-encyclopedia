I had a lot of fun messing around with the engine and ended up making 5 levels that are very different from each other. If you're having any issues with a level I included a Hint section in the README file. This is my first game jam so let me know if you liked it or what you found frustrating, thanks for playing my game! -Brian</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T06:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80e/80efb696ccb4623bbcaa7b18d192f73a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bcawley"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
