People try to continue to lead a completely normal life while the country is in a state of war and catastrophe.\r\n</p>\n<p> Coming from Odesa in Ukraine myself, the project is very personal to me. In October 2022 I was in Odesa and the comic was created from my personal experience and perception of the situation.\r\n</p>\n<p>With my Project, I want to get attention to the problems like blackouts, no opportunity for children to get appropriate education, and depressive and hopeless everyday lives of people and also hint at topics like unemployment. For those people, this state of living became normal in a grotesque way.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: The game contains imagery and sounds that might be triggering.\u00a0\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The game is best experienced with headphones.
