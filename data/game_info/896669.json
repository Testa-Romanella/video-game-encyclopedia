With only a small array of weapons and limited ammo, you must fight through six claustrophobic levels as you attempt to contain the outbreak - alien by alien.<br/><br/>Although your gun can tear through enemies quickly, you are only human. Only a few hits may be enough to kill you. In INCOMER, you should always plan your approach carefully.<br/><br/>INCOMER uses a RPG system mechanic to roll enemy stats every time they spawn, meaning that no two enemies will ever be the same.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURING,.,,</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> Amazing graphics and sound<br/></li><li> An engaging single player campaign<br/></li><li> An array of atmospheric sound effects<br/></li><li> Written exclusively for Steam<br/></li><li> Six nail-biting levels of puzzles, traps, and a host of mean, ugly, and nasty alien creatures</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T05:04:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a4/3a41ff8613db12e7abdff26d5ec97dc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["43DM Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["43DM Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
