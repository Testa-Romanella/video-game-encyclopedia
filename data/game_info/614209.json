Button-bot is a 10ish hour countdown clock of battery emojis above a rainbow. Press the trackball reaction to reset the timer back to the beginning, and gain the current color's role. Each role gives access to a uniquely themed channel, where members can chat and discover secret bot commands related to their theme.</p>\n<p>Some might try to get every role once, others might aim only for the highest, and still others might find a color or community they like and settle in. There are many ways to play, but only one Button per server, so don't forget to keep it alive!</p>\n\n<p>Writing, interaction ideas, pseudocode by L-Mop.</p>\n<p>Final code by Camden.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:15:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acffdf50f0e6960976793470989e9020.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["L-Mop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
