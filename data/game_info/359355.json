Use their respective powers to protect the Chronoxin fuel from hazards, traps and enemies found in the grid-based isometric levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nClimb the 13 levels by solving hardcore puzzles while thinking fast. Make sure the payload reaches the end of its track, and be ready to protect it with your life. Literally.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse the mage\u2019s Teleportation and Stasis, the scout\u2019s enhanced speed and defusing skill, as well as the soldier\u2019s sword and shield to make sure nothing gets in your way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEncounter a variety of deadly automates and complex traps that will put your brain to the test.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut more importantly : don\u2019t lose track of Time, or else, the tower will move without you!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/011/011a6811d2829fce6463ac60d54320a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TickTacTic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["TickTacTic"], "esrb_rating": null}
