Below is linked a google form that you can fill out and give feedback. It would help a lot if you took the time to fill it out :))</p>\n<p>https://forms.gle/7ApeLPs8g2WaGNU26</p>\n<p>In this game, you are a slime that is climbing up an endless tower. Use WASD or arrow keys to move your character and jump and dash with the space and/or shift keys. As you climb, you'll notice that there are preset room templates that the game will randomly select as you continue to climb up the endless tower, creating replayability in this arcade style game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T12:00:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2c/b2c39bc19c7ae05e59f2d64fc9898cb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FIargin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
