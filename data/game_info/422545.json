In this game you play as me, but my interpretation of the autobiographical portion of the assignment is a bit facetious.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I decided that to compliment the power fantasy of a fighting game, I would depict myself, not as I really am, but as this\u00a0 kind of childish ideal of a cool guy action hero type.\u00a0 The concept is a bit self-deprecating, but I couldn't really think of anything that interesting to base a game off of in my life.</p>\n<p>There were a lot of ups and downs in the development of this project, this is actually my third attempt at making a base for a fighting game, and of all the attempts I learned the most from this one.\u00a0 I'm proud of the hit box and animation systems and the custom 2D controllers, but the further along I got, the more I realized this was not really how fighting games worked.\u00a0 This is a very bare-bones representation of the more complex and tuned systems I tried to emulate.\u00a0 I feel much the same way about the visuals.\u00a0 I used unlit, textured, 3D models and rendered them at a very low resolution to create a pixelated sprite effect, a process far more cost effective than drawing the sprite sheets by hand.\u00a0 Unfortunately, without any further editing, this process doesn't really preserve the fidelity of a 2D sprite, but this technique is still an invaluable one and with minimal editing I believe can be used to reach that desired effect. Regardless, I think it still looks pretty cool.\u00a0 I'm not a great writer, but I think I did an okay job making the character kind of absurd.\u00a0The final part of my development process I want to touch on was developing the AI.\u00a0 I intend to continue updating the AI as it is painfully basic.\u00a0 It's not really AI, but just randomly chosen patterns and an automatically blocking character.\u00a0 Either way, it works and I'm proud of that.\u00a0 I think that overall I over scoped a bit on this project and underestimated the amount of work it would take to try to make a fighting game from scratch, but I'm still happy with the final result.</p>\n<p>Song:</p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MzXf-0kZJPDJ25oMqEKmIaKtvHj9gBL_/view<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:10:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/984/9849e6e0f116c7ca9d8484d0872d1f3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlankSlate"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
