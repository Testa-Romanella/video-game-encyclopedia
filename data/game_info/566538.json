With seasonal in-game events and exciting skins, Crashers of Aetheria will keep you and your friends coming back for more fun.<h3>CCG At A New Level</h3>We\u2019re taking Card Collecting Games to the next level by overhauling the standard formula and by adding more skill and strategic components rather than relying on random elements.<h3>Control Your Fate</h3>The choice is up to you with less randomized features. This helps the player use their best skills and create some awesome game-winning shots!<br/><br/><h3>In-Game Events</h3>Here at Crashers of Aetheria, we love holidays! To show that we hold regular, fun in-game events multiple times per year! This is your chance to collect all of the new exciting cards, skins, icons as well as in-game features. This definitely is something you do not want to miss out on.<h3>Skins</h3>Have you ever loved a character but hated its look? Speak no more with our new skins! We update regularly with new in-game content and are sure we have something that will match both you and your characters aesthetic.<h3>Crasher Pass</h3>Love Crashers of Atheria and want to take the romance to the next level? We introduce to you the Crasher Pass. The Crasher Pass allows you to gain XP for playing games online or offline. This allows you to get some awesome rewards at each level!<h3>Story Base Campaign</h3>Travel the great land of Aetheria, uniting the factions of the land. You will be tasked with helping out the King's region on your great journey. Will you be the sole commander to help re-unite the land and break years of fighting?<br/><br/>Fight through a story-based campaign earning rewards to help you fill out your decks or simply practice against some AI opponents. The Story mode has a little something for everyone.<h3>No Buying Card Packs</h3>We follow a capsule system instead of forcing players to pay for card packs. The capsule system works by gaining capsules by playing games online or offline. Next, you will play a fun mini-game mode that will allow you to determine which new Crashers you have unlocked.<br/><br/>Already have your favourite cards? No problem, stock up on capsules before one of our in-game expansions to ensure you don't miss out on any new and exciting additions! <br/><br/>But what happens if I get a duplicate card? We have you covered with our Shard system. The Shard system allows you to convert any duplicate cards into a card of your choice.<h3>Competitive Cross-platform Multiplayer</h3>We provide a fun experience for anyone on any device on any Crashers of Aetheria supported platform! We want you and all of your friends to have a fun experience together!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T03:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/894/89443def83b52754fb84638d99ed5ae6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Red Panda Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Red Panda Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
