The gameplay consists of skillful levelling, with  elimination of all obstacles encountered (enemies and inanimate things  as well) along the way.                The basic feature of the game is the significant dynamics,  most of the time requiring the considerable concentration.                The game's goal is providing sensations and joy from  battles with various creatures while wandering through many types of  locations (from mazes to open worlds).                          </p>\n<p>               One of the most distinguishing features of the game is  real-time time manipulation mechanics.               Player is allowed to slow down the gameplay for a short  period of time (bullet time) and is able to travel back to the past.               This feature is strictly integrated with battles and can  be used in a fully dynamic way.                           </p>\n<p>               The plot of the game can be discovered only directly through the gameplay.               If you want to learn more about <strong>RAG3</strong> world, download the game!               You can play in <strong>multiplayer</strong> mode with your friends as well!                                      </p>\n<p> <strong>Beware!</strong> Travelling in time comes with consequences.               Be careful when you meet your past self! <br/></p>\r\nControl\r\n<p>Steering can be changed by user. By default it is:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li><em>WSAD</em> for movement. <em>LShift</em> changes moving to running.\r\n</li><li><em>Mouse</em> used for aiming, <em>LeftButton</em> uses current weapon, <em>MouseWheel</em> changes weapon, <em>RightButton</em> triggers bullet time.\r\n</li><li><em>Q</em> and <em>E</em> triggers dodging.\r\n</li><li><em>F</em> triggers object activation if player is somewhere near and <em>T</em> talks to the talkable NPC.\r\n</li><li><em>R</em> triggers time reversal.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nMultiplayer\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently game provides only self-hosted multiplayer architecture. The gameplay resembles a dynamic deathmatch from old times of gaming. To play with your friends you need to start <strong>Rag3Server</strong> on one of your computers or on dedicated machine. There are several settings which can be adjusted before starting the server. Last thing to do is to pick map and start the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nEvery player should be able to reach server host on the game TCP/UDP ports (54000, 54001, 54002 by default) - firewall allowance may be needed. Computers should be connected via LAN or (if playing via Internet) Virtual LAN (ZeroTier, Hamachi etc.). To connect to the server each player should run <strong>Rag3Client</strong>, pick his nickname and skin (there are plenty of them) and enter server's IP address. Easy-peasy.\r\n</p>\r\nContribution\r\n<p>\r\nEvery volunteer is strongly encouraged to take part in a development process.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nIf you are not a software developer - piece of cake. You don't need to modify the code to change the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nGame has been created with potential extensions and modifications in mind. Core architecture is designed in a very flexible way. One can easily modify game objects, maps, characters and add new ones. A lot of game's behaviors and actions is parametrized and is editable via configuration files. Every object used in a game is described in <strong>*.j3x</strong> files in data/ directory. Syntax of files is self-describing. RAG3 provides dedicated map/game editor <strong>RAG3Editor</strong> as an additional application for easy map making and environment edition.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nUsage of this tool is described in <strong>RAG3Editor Instruction</strong>.
