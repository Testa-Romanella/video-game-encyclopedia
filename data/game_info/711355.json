I\u00a0hope you enjoy it! Thank you for giving me a chance to branch out!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>You are the Lantern Bearer. Hounded by living shadows, you must open the way forward to defeat their king. Follow the signs, and find the keys.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u00a0know the text is small, so here's a copy of the instructions in the How to Play section!:</strong></p>\n<p>To move, use the WASD or Arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Hearts -\u00a0If you lose all of your hearts, the game is over, and you must restart from the beginning. They\u00a0will be gradually restored over time, as long as you aren\u2019t starving. Enemies and certain hazards\u00a0will take hearts from you.</p>\n<p>Lanterns -\u00a0Use the Space Bar to attack enemies in your circle of light. The light will banish all enemies in the\u00a0circle, but beware: your lantern has limited uses. It will regain these uses gradually over time.</p>\n<p>Food -\u00a0Over time, you will become hungrier. Once all of your food icons have been depleted, you will\u00a0gradually lose hearts. In order to stave off hunger, you can pick up mushrooms. There is a limited\u00a0number growing here, and they will not regrow.</p><p>---</p><p>I\u00a0left gameplay slightly vague for the purposes of discovery, but I'm happy to assist if you get stuck!</p><p>With any luck, I'll be adding a WebGL and a Mac download soon. Thank you for your patience!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:08:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed7/ed7b7ac4087a897c8b95569aad15c70d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Applebun Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
