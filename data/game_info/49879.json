Set in a <strong>comedy Ancient Egypt</strong>, this construction site chaos is the ultimate <strong>Sandbox game</strong>! Direct your workers by giving orders and manipulating physics obstacles: move boulders, push blocks, avoid fire traps and dodge the swinging spikes. Don\u2019t let Cleopatra give you the Needle! Across 20+ tricky levels, there\u2019s emergent gameplay and comedy outcomes to create: buildings to wreck, crates to smash, coins to collect, even a hot tub!<br/><br/>Your workers are, let\u2019s be honest, a bit dumb \u2013 they forget where to go, get themselves burnt, drowned or even catapulted off the edge of the world! It\u2019s your job to show them how to fulfil the Cleopatra\u2019s wishes; keep on sending more of the little fellas until they do. Alternatively just smite them down with fire and lightning! It\u2019s your management style, so your choice! The fate of the workers, their antics and even avoiding the clutches of Sobek the Crocodile God are all there to make us laugh.<br/><br/>Cleo\u2019s Lost Idols has a deeply ingrained video mechanic, <strong>enabling you to make, edit, share and watch gameplay videos, right within the game</strong>; no video expertise required! Upload your videos to YouTube, get them liked, and watch yourself climb the rankings in the game\u2019s video leaderboard. Enjoy other people\u2019s clips too. Watch their workers fail to complete their orders in spectacular fashion, see their cunning solutions to getting the statue pieces restored, speed-run the levels or getting that last coin you didn\u2019t even know existed.<br/><br/>Cleo\u2019s Lost Idols is a strategy game about monumental construction in Ancient Egypt; not so much a pyramid scheme as an oasis of streaming fun as wide as the Nile!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f69/f69c022f860a0a0d8f7b284e2c00797f.jpg", "website": "http://cleoslostidols.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 131}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tomb Team"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chilled Mouse"], "esrb_rating": null}
