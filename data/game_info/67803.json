It is still a fast paced ninja climbing game, where your goal is to rise as high as you possibly can. But, this time you will be avoiding new, more treacherous enemies such as: angry beetles, wacky snakes, evil witch doctors, funky monkeys, mad hornets, bee hives, ninja pirates, cannon balls, peeved parrots and enraged sea monsters. Our goal is to continue to consistently release new levels for this game, so this is only the beginning.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T11:59:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29d/29d7d8351b919486b3025a32664e5709.jpg", "website": "http://www.backflipstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Backflip Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Backflip Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
