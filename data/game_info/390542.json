You can purchase it here\nYour role is to uncover evidence as a journalist by sneaking through restricted areas and questioning people on their actions through a series of one-on-one interviews. All this takes place in a detailed, systems-driven world where people will react to your actions and where time is your biggest enemy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt White Paper Games, we focus on worlds that feel lived in through non-linear spaces and objectives that can be solved with multiple approaches. We love games with a strong narrative drive that tackle important social issues and aim to set that standard within our own work. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe understand not everyone plays for the deeper narrative experience, and for those that like the idea of trespassing, breaking into secure locations and hacking 4 digit codes, we have plenty of rule breaking opportunities to take advantage of in the world of The Occupation\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of creating a feature list, we wanted to highlight the cool work our team of 9 have created over the past 4 years of development.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTime is a precious resource to us all. Every minute in the game is a real-world minute and The Occupation is played over a fixed time length so make sure your actions count. Your watch can be used to set alarms and timers to help keep track of important objectives such as time delayed safes so you don\u2019t have to hang around whilst security is searching for you somewhere you shouldn't be.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWherever you live, the chances are you\u2019re in a country that could be run a little better, where trust may be feeling a little low. You may not care how their decisions impact you and you instead continue with your daily life ignoring the distracting scaremongering. Or, you may be actively involved in trying to create true change. We love that, in most countries, people have a choice in this, and that\u2019s how we wanted to approach The Occupation\u2019s gameplay design. The world is open for you to explore and it\u2019s up to you what threads you find interesting and wish to follow in the world. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel Hillben and Steven Crow are the security guards employed by The Bowman Carson Group and will be around to monitor your activity to make sure you\u2019re not doing anything you shouldn\u2019t be. Daniel Hillben has been with the Bowman Carson Group for many years so try not to get on the wrong side of him. You may have seen the acting work of Steven Crow in advertisements such as \u2018Warts Away\u2019 or \u2018The Restorer\u2019; Steve is working this security gig to pay the bills but his real aspirations lay in Hollywood. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether you chose to break into a office through the window, find an ID card or pull the power to the room, we designed the world to accommodate your choice, approach and need to interact with objects you may or may not need for your research. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely, if you read this far and enjoy the work we create, thank you. We put everything we have into these game and we really do appreciate every person that invest their time and hard earned money into the games we create. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n- The White Paper Team", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T01:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d6/0d6f9b1c15ba54f4dae8bd196d2e7374.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 72}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 418, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["White Paper Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Humble Bundle"], "esrb_rating": null}
