For example, a 5 above a column means that somewhere in that column, there is a group of five black squares with no spaces between them.<br/><br/>You must use logic to figure out which squares should be filled in, and which should stay blank. When you solve the puzzle, the grid will have a picture in it.<br/><br/>Hints:<br/>- 0 means that all of the squares should be blank; none should be filled in. Click each white square twice to create an X, so you will know not to fill it in.<br/>- 5 in a 5*5 puzzle means there are five squares in the row. That means you must fill in all five squares. Click each square once until they are all black.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/1074a8be3fad4d340c280824489aa928.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Hassan Goldani Moghaddam"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Hassan Goldani Moghaddam"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
