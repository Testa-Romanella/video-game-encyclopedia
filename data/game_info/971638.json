Should you put on a paint blaster? Hack on a mechanical hand? Perhaps place a penguin on top? After you've decided, take your creation into battle against another team in online combat. Communicate with your partner to control your bot. You both control every part but each part has had their controls split among you. You may be able to aim a turret but only your partner can fire it. Level up your teamwork in this combat experience unlike any other.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T21:45:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cf/3cf2016bc09d8d6d6d02d2563c6b0a86.jpg", "website": "https://duolbotselise.wixsite.com/website", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["E.L.I.S.E."], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["E.L.I.S.E."], "esrb_rating": null}
