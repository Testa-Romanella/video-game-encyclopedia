Later levels will be more challenging and more different tiles will be introduced. The player moves on a grid of tiles. Some of these tiles will be disappearing when you are stepping off it and others will teleport you to another place. One tile acts as a cage with another that will free you from entrapment. There is even a tile that creates more tiles!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T02:58:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ac/3ac6c4a3eafa8b5dc0cc82d6cabe74a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tuwi Mich Nannings"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
