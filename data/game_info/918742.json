In this short demo, players take the role of a junior care assistant on their first shift, in a home for the creatures not of our world.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Spend time with the mysterious \"Pearl,\" lend a friendly ear and see what you can learn about her world.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Just remember: The second floor is off-limits...</em></p>\n\n<p>Lakeside Manor was a short solo project, created for a two-month university assignment using Unity and the Fungus plug-in. I would definitely like to expand on this idea in the future, so any and all feedback is welcome!</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Jigsaw image: 'Ecco The Dolphin,' by Boris Vallejo</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Background music from mixkit.co</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sound effects from soundsnap.com</strong></p><p><strong>Fonts from dafont.com</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T12:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/940d6d9c59c6a83b24b0cb5820c41dbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["syncing_ships"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
