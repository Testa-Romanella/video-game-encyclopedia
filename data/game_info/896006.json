From wrangling wild muscle milk to toppling takoyakistacks and battling lemon fish, it takes a dedicated sort to make their way on the Cookie Plains. For Lemuel, following in his grandpappies footsteps and becoming a master chef has always been the dream. He's fought the fight, prepared the dishes, and collected the trophies to prove it. But something has changed in the Land of Milk and Cookies, formerly placid preparations have begun attacking young sous chef hopefuls, and much of the landscape has begun reshaping into impassable terrain. But worst of all, Lemuel's trophy collection has gone missing just before the great Chef Cookout! What, or who is the cause of all this trouble? And what can one lone owl do to save a world out of control? Lemuel is about to find out!</p>\n<p>This game was built over 9 days for the Big Festive Jam hosted by the Game Developers Network. The theme for the jam was \"exponential possibilities\", so we chose to add a collection scheme to our game that would utilize the exponential property of recipes and ingredients (yes, there is a exponential formula that describes the relationship) to create trophies with fun pictures and interesting game facts/lore.</p>\n<p>Note: If you're having trouble with the HTML build, please try the Windows build.<br/></p>\r\nControls?\r\nFunctionKeyboardGamepadControl player movement<br/>Arrow keys<br/>D-padPause game<br/>EnterStart<br/>Change powerup<br/>Shift<br/>SelectJump, interact<br/>X<br/>BRun, interact<br/>Z<br/>ARestart level (in alpha builds)<br/>Delete- -\r\n<p>Note: Keyboard controls are only accessible if there is NO gamepad plugged into the system.
