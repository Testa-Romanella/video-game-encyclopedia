I have recently began to develop at GML and had a ton of fun making this!</p>\n<p>This game is called Pumpkin's Task, where as you play a young Pumpkin that wants to help her friend Mori, a 2 foot high Skeleton kid. He lost the sword to his Viking costume when your brother Squash tossed it in the cemetery! Mori is entrusting you to be his friend and help him retrieve it, however there are rumors that the cemetery Witch has been looking for you!</p>\n<p>I had 2 weeks to make this game and I did the programming and art. The music was done by my good friend Justin Brahimi, his Instagram tag is @prodbyjust. Contact him if you need any sounds!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T07:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a6/8a6114e544d1831975473489604af6f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["newworldcircuit"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
