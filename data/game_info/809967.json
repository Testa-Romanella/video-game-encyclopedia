{"id": 809967, "slug": "shoot-that-bird", "name": "Shoot that Bird", "name_original": "Shoot that Bird", "description": "<p>This is a small arcade game where you shoot birds as they pass by. They come from both sides of the screen and fly horizontally across it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game consists of many waves and each one gets progressively more difficult with new birds and more difficult twists. In order to make it to the next wave you must shoot enough birds, this amount is called the\u00a0<strong>quota</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If the quota isn't reached before the end of a wave, then the player games over.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game was made using SFML and a video about it can be found on my YouTube channel\u00a0CodeNoodles - YouTube. Even though this game is free it does cost time and money to make and if you would like to see more games such as this one, please consider donating! Any amount will go a long way and would be much appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks, and enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T12:21:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa1/fa1f86fd4706b95ffb62d7c069451e37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CodeNoodles"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
