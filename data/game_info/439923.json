I\u00a0have not created anything in Unity for a while, so this project is just\u00a0 a way of refreshing my memory!\u00a0It was completed over the course of a week or so in the evenings, taking probably around 10 - 12 hours over all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play is simple, space bar fires the rocket, don't run out of fuel and don't crash! Scores are awarded for how gently you land (a gentler landing gives a better score). You are given progressively less fuel and the start altitude becomes higher, see how high you can score before you crash!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/344b300b20629668c835d255fcbb6ed7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["danhedges"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
