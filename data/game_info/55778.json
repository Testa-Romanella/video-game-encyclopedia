The three versions differ completely from each other, sharing only the basic premise involving the titular characters searching for tickets to a GWAR concert. The games were advertised as featuring music by the band. A fourth version was later released for the Game Boy by GT Interactive Software in 1998 without the GWAR tie-in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T01:41:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb4751d5a2eecdbcb8c0f11b2c271044.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Game Boy", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Radical Entertainment", "Torus Games", "Realtime Associates", "NuFX"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["GT Interactive Software", "Viacom New Media", "Viacom"], "esrb_rating": null}
