Assets were created in Autodesk Maya, textures were made in Adobe Substance Painter, and everything was put together in Unreal Engine. This temple is for a game concept I am developing that is based in a desert. I chose statues, pillars, and pots as my assets because they are commonly found in Ancient Egyptian temples which is what I used as a reference.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T06:43:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e45/e4522c67f597b5a7567baa593d18ef1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alibiscus_art"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
