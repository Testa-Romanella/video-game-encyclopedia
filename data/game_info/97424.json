Each player has a different color, and they\u00a0 need to make sure that their color will be the only one color on the entire map. In order to ensure their success they need to move from key to key, thus coloring the map, thus expanding their territory (They can also collect special items, such as Paint Bombs, Paint Lines, Airstrikes, Bonus Moves, and so on). But expansion itself won't grant the success, they also have to perform elimination, which they do by coloring keys on which their foes are standing!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Are you ready to face your opponents?\u00a0Are you ready to participate in this battle? I hope you are, because you gonna need a good tactic to grant yourself a victory!</p>\r\nHow does the gameplay look like?\r\n<p>In Tactical Typing, 2-6 players (human and/or computer ones) are placed on an empty map, that is shaped like a computer keyboard, and is divided into 45 keys. Whenever you have a turn, you can preform only one (or more, depending on the amount of moves you have) of the three actions:</p>\n<p>-Move to the other key (that key must be the same color as you are), by pressing corresponding key on your physical keyboard, this way you are coloring keys around you</p>\n<p>- Use special item (if you have one), by holding space bar and key on which you want to use that item (you can also pause the game whenever it's your turn,\u00a0in order to read about that special item you have)</p>\n<p>- Nothing, I don't know why would you do that, but it is an option.</p>\n<p>Your objective is to eliminate other players, so that you are the only one left on the map. There are two ways of eliminating an enemy:</p>\n<p>- Drain his health to zero, by coloring keys on which he is standing</p>\n<p>- Get rid of all of his keys, by coloring every of his keys.</p>\n<p>Every few turns, a random thing (such as special item, health pack, power up, bonus move) will appear on a random key, that could give advantage to some, and disadvantage to the others. And if\u00a0 the battle will be going on for too long, a timeout will occur (timeouts are basically sudden deaths).</p>\r\nHow's the progress on the game?\r\n<p>This is a small passion project, that I've been wotking on in Unity 5 for some time now. The development on this game began on january 27th 2018 and I have been working on this project in my spare time (that I don't really have a lot of). The game is still in development, although most of it is already finished. If everything goes correct, the full version should be released in Q3\u00a02018.<br/></p>\n<p>I would also like to mention, that the demo version shows what has been achieved within the first month of the development.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any feedback\u00a0or a question, please leave a comment regarding it!</p>\n<p>(This game requires fully working keyboard with QWERTY US/UK or DVORAK layout)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c7/9c72972d0d624ce4d6521d228ad8eec4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GMPguy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
