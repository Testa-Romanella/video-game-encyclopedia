Bakery, a brand new bakery opening in the local mall. Meet other mall employees while you're handing out flyers and help them deal with their own problems by playing store-themed Match 3 puzzles. If you help them out, maybe they'll come visit on opening day!</p>\n\n<p>This game was created in one weekend for Wholesome Games Jam 2022! Our first build features 3 NPCs and 3 levels, with the idea that a longer game would feature several different stores, more characters, and increasingly complex puzzles.
