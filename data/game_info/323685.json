This is the first (actually second but sure) prototype of my game for my coursework. This is the first game I've made so this has been a huge learning experience. I'll greatly welcome any constructive criticism, but I have been restricted by time and some things that I wanted to include haven't been included, purely for time/ability reasons. So I hope you find some way to enjoy it lol. I have the rest of the day to finish this so here's my list of things I want to include:</p>\n<ul><li>More dungeon items/accessible areas</li><li>Save Files</li><li>Bow and Arrow appear on player and can be unequipped</li><li>More bosses</li><li>Perfected game over screen</li><li>Health boost dialogue (or some other graphical prompt)</li><li>A story/instructions</li><li>More varied dungeons</li></ul>\n<p>Hope you guys enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>P.S. Oh and here's a list of elements that are kind of in the game but that I probably won't finish:</p>\n<ul><li>Operational bombs</li><li>A money system</li><li>An arrow system</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0f/a0f10c02667586f28c6d658abf0d77a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tryvian"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
