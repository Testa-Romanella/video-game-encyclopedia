Hack and slash your way through orcs, dragons, and cockatrices as you explore the perilous procedurally-generated dungeons seeking the Amulet of Yendor.About NetHackNetHack is an open source, deeply immersive roguelike that has been under development for over three decades. The work of the NetHack DevTeam and hundreds of contributors from over the years have created a deep and highly interactive world, where armor rusts from getting wet, scrolls burn from catching on fire, and bright flashes of light blind you. But the immersion goes both ways: grease your armor so the water rolls off, place your scrolls in a bag to protect them, and shield your eyes with a blindfold! The depth and complexity between game mechanics has given rise to the well-deserved credo: \"The DevTeam Thinks of Everything.\"About NetHack: LegacyNetHack: Legacy is one of many variants of NetHack and is developed independently from the NetHack DevTeam. The focus of this variant is to highlight and enhance the essence of NetHack, softening the rough edges that built up over the years and enriching the overall experience.
