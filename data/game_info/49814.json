Therefore, this game is the next challenge to overcome only for those daring players who managed to successfully complete the previous part. <br/>\r\nFor this reason, the player will be required to enter the PASSWORD obtained at the end of the first episode of \"Symplok\u00e9\". <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll texts in game are translated into English but the spanish voices have been left as they were, to provide the player with an atmosphere as close as possible to the original version. Soundtrack is funny as well and all graphics have been designed with Microsoft Paint. What else do you need to be told to download this work and immerse yourself in the magical world of a engagingly roguish hero?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60a3a2c17c7d28c0c4d324b74a02f950.jpg", "website": "https://www.videojuegosfermin.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 16}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Videojuegos Ferm\u00edn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Videojuegos Ferm\u00edn"], "esrb_rating": null}
