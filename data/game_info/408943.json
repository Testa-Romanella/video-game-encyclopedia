Press the Joystick(L3) for selection. It's highly recommended to use a gamepad, but it's also possible to move using WASD and select with the Enter or Space button.</p><p><strong>Created by:</strong>\u00a0Jann Andre Fjelde Mjoen, Davide Beercock, Cameryn Tuliao, Samuel Chaba for Global Game Jam 2020 at Abertay University, Scotland<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T04:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f5/7f546b0c7fca736fd804a937e6c7b98a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Precotonejde"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
