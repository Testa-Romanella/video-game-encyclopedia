The hero is <strong>Cee</strong>, an outdated and bored Cleaner, tasked with cleaning the system from the viruses and restoring the sacred Firewall. In each level, she will have to fight different enemies based on real file extensions and eventually satirical caricatures of well-known services as bosses. Along with the story mode, the game comes with a one of a kind rogue mode, where the player can select real files that want to be deleted from the computer and defeat them in battle.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The fight is set on wide 2D rooms with different platforms, where the player has to continuously switch between <strong>4 weapons</strong>, rewarding a fighting style based on<strong> high mobility</strong>. Each weapon has a different attack pattern and special ability, like dashing or double jump. The storyworld the game comes with has unlimited potential for future expansions, which could become, together with a Pro version of the built-in <br/>cleaner, the main source of profit of the game. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimers</strong></p>\n<p>To test all the mechanics of the game we give you the possibility to play in reverse the level with all the weapons unlocked, so please be sure to reach the end of the level and play it in the other direction to give useful feedbacks.<br/>Before starting the game you can equip one RAMpage ability in the shop, otherwise the default Overclock ability will be equipped.<br/>Visual arts and sounds are not complete yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>ACTION</p><p>Keyboard <br/></p>Controller\u00a0<br/>(optimized\u00a0for\u00a0<br/>XBOX\u00a0controller)Move Left/Right<br/>A/DLeft Stick<br/>AttackLeft Mouse Button<br/>XRAMpage (activate RAMpage ability when the RAMpage bar is full)QYDashRight Mouse ButtonRBJump/Double Jump/Slow FallSpace BarAEquip Weapon1, 2, 3, 4D-PadHook (enalbe/disable)VLBLook Up/DownW/SLeft Stick<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T05:36:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b1547d8b066554df44db55cdca721705.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective", "f_com"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
