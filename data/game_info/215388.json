Collecting 6 key shards will give your familiar the power to unlock doors blocking your path.</p>\n<p>Your familiar emits light and attracts certain characters. Use your cursor and move it around to distract or summon them.\u00a0Other characters are not affected by this. You must move and avoid them. Every 10 seconds your character calls back your familiar (cursor) and resets it. Collect the shards to unlock the seal and progress through to the next level. To unlock doors, place your familiar close to the glowing node.</p>\n<p>----\u00a0</p><p>Creator Notes\r\nGame was made in 48 hours for GMTK Game Jam 2018 - Genre without a mechanic.\r\nCreated by a team of 5, 4 of which learned how to model and create the game during the same time period.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/611/611764f54f2904c44f1b64c0f5cc95c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["moogs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
