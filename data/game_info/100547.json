{"id": 100547, "slug": "exilus", "name": "Exilus", "name_original": "Exilus", "description": "<p>\"Exilus\" is a Sci-Fi Metroidvania-esc platformer. </p>\n\n<p>Inspired by such games as Exile (1988) and Metroid (1986/1987/1988), you control a small pixelated spaceman trying to find his way off of a hostile planet while combating hostile invaders and exploring deep caverns and ancient ruins. </p>\n<p>The game features two difficulty settings which change power-up locations and level design, adding some replay value, as well as an introduction/tutorial, and will encourage player exploration as opposed to linear game-play (at least to an extent). </p>\n\n<p>The game also features a <em>randomized powerup</em> mode that changes the locations of most major upgrades and guns on a run-by-run basis.</p>\n\n<p>There is a loose story-line in Exilus, with a simple introduction and epilogue playing before and after each new game. In-game text is minimal. The game was developed by a single developer over the course of a year between 2016 and 2017.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/303/303f85f6baddb94f46f3fcb906db6064.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
