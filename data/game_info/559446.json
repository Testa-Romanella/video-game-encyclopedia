Through it, Thanet residents are invited to digitise, document and memorialise personal objects as artefacts, which act as placeholders for memories. These artefacts are arranged in a 3D environment where visitors can navigate and sieve through a growing collection of things deemed important for creating a digital archaeology of contemporary Thanet. 'Memory Palace Thanet' is developed in collaboration with Travayne Burrows (Blas\u00e9 Games). The musical score and soundscape was custom made\u00a0by Francesca Ter-Berg.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:02:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/451/4518f847f964372660a313c421dcc4d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Umut and Anna Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
