All variations are split up into 12 parts in-game so the player can retry certain variation without going through the whole piece again.\u00a0More information about the piece can be found under the\u00a0<strong>Credits</strong> section.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Using mouse to control is highly recommended in the game\u00a0and should be the preferred controls.
