Master the art of carefully placing your mines, detonating them with expert timing, and BOOM - Birdie!<br/><br/>The game is divided into two phases: setup your golf ball with mines, then blast it into space (or better, into the hole) by detonating them! You have full control on which mines explode and when, which gives you complete power over your rocket ball trajectory. Golf clubs will feel so basic after this!FEATURES<ul><li> <strong>18 challenging holes</strong> - increasing difficulty, no tutorial. Are you tough enough?<br/></li><li> <strong>Slowmo and acrobatic aerial turns</strong> - total control, albeit very inefficient!<br/></li><li> <strong>Unbelievable views</strong> - enter a chill, relaxed environment in which your swearing will echo for miles around.<br/></li><li> <strong>Online Leaderboards</strong> - Join the global challenge.<br/></li><li> <strong>Explosions!</strong> - Exploding mines, exploding barrels, exploding explosions all around!<br/></li><li> <strong>Game up!</strong> - Bernard Suits would be super happy of our lusory attitude.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T09:37:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e1815e5e446bca93f1f09e1b9ff16e2.jpg", "website": "http://34bigthings.com/press/sheet.php?p=super_inefficient_golf", "rating": 3.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 288, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["34BigThings"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["34BigThings"], "esrb_rating": null}
