Link:\u00a0https://gamejolt.com/games/jojotheworld/455450</strong></p>\n<p>THE GAME</p>\n<p><strong>The game is Za warudo (time stop) simulator where you can stop time, throw knifes, do a road roller da, play some popular lines like: oh you're approaching me, WRYYYYYYYY, STANDO POWER.... In the future the game will allow you to use different stands than the world. Timestop will be infinite for now. In the future i'll make it customizable.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The game is a first person (for now) simulator</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you have a good idea, just post it in to comments.</strong></p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p><strong>Q - Infinite Time Stop</strong></p>\n<p><strong>R - WRYYYYYY</strong></p>\n<p><strong>F - Reload Level</strong></p>\n<p>FUTURE PLANS</p>\n<p><strong>I plan to make a whole stand system where you will be able to summon your stand with a key and use him like in the show. Short distance stands are able to move just 1-3 meters away from stand user, long range stands are able to go much far away. Every stand will be done at its full power (means Star Platinum will be able to stop time for 5 seconds instead 2 seconds). This will be a big challenge for me so don't expect to be released quickly. Once i'll make a Za Warudo simulator playable i'll release it and move to doing the stand system</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br/><strong>Star Platinum: you are able to do stand rush (ORA ORA ORA), Star finger, big ORA punch, Timestop for 5 seconds...</strong></p>\n<p>Tags</p>\n<p><strong>#action</strong>\u00a0<strong>#altgame</strong>\u00a0<strong>#other</strong>\u00a0<strong>#fangame</strong>\u00a0<strong>#jojo</strong>\u00a0<strong>#jjba</strong>\u00a0<strong>#timestop</strong>\u00a0<strong>#ZaWarudo</strong>\u00a0<strong>#TheWorld</strong>\u00a0<strong>#DIO</strong>\u00a0<strong>#dio</strong>\u00a0<strong>#jojos</strong>\u00a0<strong>#wry</strong>\u00a0<strong>#muda</strong>\u00a0<strong>#dio</strong>\u00a0<strong>#brando</strong>\u00a0<strong>#stand</strong>\u00a0<strong>#freeze</strong>\u00a0<strong>#time</strong>\u00a0<strong>#vampire</strong>\u00a0<strong>#sun</strong>\u00a0<strong>#jojomeme</strong>\u00a0<strong>#meme</strong>\u00a0<strong>#puzzle</strong>\u00a0<strong>#sports</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Be sure to check this site for updates and more updated versions of this game.
