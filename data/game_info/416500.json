I finished it with about 5 minutes to spare. The controls are standard first person (wasd and mouse with tab to use your echolocation) and I didn't have to make a pause menu so you'll have to die or win if you want to quit. Tho only thing that wasn't made during the three hours was the outline shader, I made it a little while ago following this video:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQw1CL0xYBE. Everything else was made in the three hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T03:52:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01d5985b230fc5bdd5ef5a19c7de39c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rende36"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
