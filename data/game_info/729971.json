{"id": 729971, "slug": "pinecone-pizza-party", "name": "Pinecone Pizza Party", "name_original": "Pinecone Pizza Party", "description": "<p>This game was created for <strong>Global Game Jam 2022, </strong>based on the theme of \"duality\" (cute/mischievous, prospect/refuge, risk/reward). You can check out its entry on the GGJ website at https://globalgamejam.org/2022/games/pinecone-pizza-party-4<br/></p>\n<p>You are Pinecone, an adorable but mischievous tortoiseshell cat who loves pizza! Your humans have ordered pizza, but won't share and instead try to spray you with water when you try to get some. Distract them with your cuteness by snuggling in cardboard boxes so they won't spray you, then rush to the pizza when they're not looking! Don't stay in the boxes too long though - if you overload your cuteness, the toddler will appear and try to put you in an inescapable snuggle!</p>\n<p>The game was built in 48 hours in GB studio with my family, including sprites and artwork by my kids! You can play in the web player, download the gbc rom to play in your favorite emulator or get it for the Analogue Pocket. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:49:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/dea46390284fe6f27f79cf4d79fac2f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pie For Breakfast Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
