The Princess had recently become infatuated with a Bard who fancied her lustrous hair, rebelious attitude and deep DEEP pockets. But the story would take a turn when dark forces curse the Princess and now the couple must travel to free the Princess of her curse... Or maybe not, since she seems to be happier than ever?</p>\n<p>This game was developed for QRMjam in the span of 5 days with the  collaboration of @YukiLumino (on twitter) who did all of the art for it!!<br/></p>\n<p>Support me on Patreon if you would like to see the rest of this project!!<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Tactical RPG gameplay! </li><li>An emotional extremely comedic story</li><li>A linear challenge!
