I really wanted a game where I could be a dragon. Most dragon games aren't really about the dragons at all. They're about ... people ... that's right. And people aren't dragons, are they? It's time to have a new dragon game that's about, you know: DRAGONS!<br/><br/><strong>What are real dragons like?</strong><br/>They're not your pets... or your animal friends. They're wild, majestic, ferocious forces of nature. But, they're not mindless. No - they're very smart... and clever... (well... sometimes.) Real dragons have character, personality, depth. You could even say there's a little human in every dragon. ( ... or maybe that depends on their diet.)<br/><br/><strong>Why should you get this game?</strong><br/>Well... if you want to be a dragon - you should totally get it!<br/><br/>Please, don't lose this chance to eat absolutely everyone!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/2245e1f6d1ca917a06a66f658c31d80c.jpg", "website": "http://www.grimdragons.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 28}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Punkster"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Punkster"], "esrb_rating": null}
