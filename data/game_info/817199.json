It\u2019s a casual platformer game that combines playing with education. Each level is designed to show animals, plants, objects or landmarks that have various heights based on real world fact. As you go around the level, you collect stars and read facts about the world itself.</p>\n\n<p>The game is inspired by my daughter as she\u2019s growing up and how small she is compared to the world out there and how I want her to see it with her own eyes one day. This is a way for me to remember the moment and her favourite dress when she was 6 months.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T11:27:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b2/5b224319fb82c8c23f5c423a7fc63c99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nicotangara"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
