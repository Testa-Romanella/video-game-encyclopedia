{"id": 160136, "slug": "imposter", "name": "Imposter", "name_original": "Imposter", "description": "<p>*If the game does not work, please clear your cache*</p><p>Imposter syndrome, the fear of being \u201cexposed\u201d, extreme feelings of fraudelence and low self-esteem can happen to anyone, in any context. Research shows that there are significant gender and racial differences in imposter syndrome incidence, due to the internalisation of fear of being unable to upkeep dual self-concepts. Those who do not match the status quo are more likely to suffer from imposter syndrome, dismissing their successes as luck. This can \u00a0result in severe low self-esteem and mental health issues.<br/></p>\n<p>While imposter syndrome is well-known, rarely are its negative implications of mental health considered on a large scale. In order to create more inclusive networks and environments for support, we must first understand and empathise. </p>\n<p>In comes Imposter, the game. Imposter aims to describe the feelings low-self esteem and being \u201clost\u201d, \u00a0experienced by those with low-self image and emphasise the cumulative long-term effects of lack of inclusivity, diversity and support in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Imposter is a browser based HTML game, designed for casual gamers. Players wake up in an unknown environment, and must make their way through a series of puzzles and randomly generated mazes. All the way through, they are bogged down by insults and attacks, lowering their HP and reducing their ability to see and move through the game. This represents the characters inner dialogue, which reduces their self-esteem and impairs their perceived ability to achieve, or get to their end goal. </p>\n<p>Using a user-centred design process, Imposter was created over a series of months, and went through iterations from low-fidelity paper prototypes to high-fidelity small scale digital prototypes in a series of design workshops using PLEX, grow-a-game and tiny game design techniques. Integrating popular game mechanics from classic maze games and survival strategy games such as Don\u2019t Starve, and concepts from serious games literature, the game aims to create deep learning of core values by inducing a state of flow. </p>\n<p>Additionally, serious games like Imposter have been shown to be useful to reduce stigma and increasing empathy for those with mental disorders. This serious game was initially created as an empathy exercise for those in industry, but due to the game design, can be used by young children in school to understand the results of micro-aggressions, and the effects that low-self worth can have on performance. Due to the simplistic gameplay and retro pixel graphics, the game is approachable for all audiences. Imposter is simultaneously challenging and simple, due to the combination of level and enemy design in combination with core mechanics and goals. </p>\n<p>Through iterative development, the game has been play tested with a large group of users. To further evaluate the degree of flow, playability and how much the game promotes reflection of topics, I aim to use mixed methods of observations, interviews and post-play questionnaires about enjoyment and affective learning. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b8670c19d33261591d61302c2f62ed07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["taliacraiu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
