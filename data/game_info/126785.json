Unfortunately, we got too ambitious on making this game under two days. It is about an epic murder mystery with a supernatural twist that combines gameplay and story. We work so hard on this and you can get a good 3-5min of the theme, music/sound, art, story, and gameplay. After reaching the hallway, there is no more gameplay and you may exit the game by going to your notepad. Please check it out, and thank you! </p><p>Programmer/Designer:</p><p>Ivan Navarro-Espinoza</p><p>Twitter: @kfcpop2112</p><p>Artist:</p><p>Marielos Navarro</p><p>Writer:</p><p>Maninder Suman</p><p>Music Composer:</p><p>Paul Melancon</p><p> MelanconMusic.com</p><p>Sound Designer:</p><p>Oscar Coen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/858/85845c4da3d3470d730de97f504bb95f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kfcpop"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
