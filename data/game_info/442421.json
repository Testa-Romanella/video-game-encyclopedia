Hopefully you can download this game to play it as I scrambled to convert it to a Unity Windows downloader instead.</p>\n\n<p>GAME DESCRIPTION</p>\n<p>In this game, use a magic orb to shine different colored lights to find secrets hidden behind the colors Red, Green, and Blue.\u00a0 Be warned, however - your orb slowly runs out of power unless you find a charging station (a pedestal with a floating orb above it in the respective color it charges).</p>\n<p>To open doors and treasure chests, it might require power from one of the colors, and these items can only be seen if you have activated the colors Red, Green, or Blue\u00a0on your orb using the R, G, and B keys, respectively.\u00a0 (Those keys turn that color on and off.)\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Additionally, see if you can find the hidden boxes containing a mystic power that folks are still trying to figure out.\u00a0 You can identify these boxes as they contain a floating sphere covered in ice, but the box should be safe to handle.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to move and arrow keys to move around, the I key to interact where prompted, and the Escape key to pause or exit the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T05:08:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/505/50599a279432a6771778bd061e0a0c1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["weenie.walker.games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
