You need energy to function.</p>\n<p>In your searches, you've stumbled upon hostile area, where most inhabitants see you just as an energy source. You need to get out. There are two exits - one guarded by strong enemy, second - locked by energy lock.</p>\n<p>You can salvage ancient storages or you\u00a0\u00a0can hunt other robots to get their energy. You can collect energy for energy lock, or you can spend it fighting a boss.\u00a0It's your call.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Failry usual room-based roguelite TDS, but shooting requires energy. Energy is also required to repair your hull, interact with some objects, and purchase upgrades. You will need to make choices, like, should you buy damage upgrade, or save the energy for difficult enconters.</p>\n<p>To avoid unwinnable siutations, player will be not locked in\u00a0rooms with enemies, but there will be measures preventing cheesing possibility to leave room mid-combat.</p>\n<p>Possibility to make movement spending energy is considered.</p>\n<p>Planned stuff for jam version:</p>\n<ul><li>Basic player functionality - run and shoot</li><li>Few simple upgrades - damage, hull, movement speed.</li><li>Few consumables - tripmines, repair kit.</li><li>Several interacible objects - trader, repair point. loot containers.</li><li>~5 or so enemy types</li><li>One floor, simple rooms, no obstacles; as much enemy patterns as I will manage to do.</li><li>One boss</li></ul>\n<p>\"Luxury\" features like minimap will be implemented if there will be time for it.</p>\n<p>I have no intention on making graphics look bad intentionally, but rest assured it will be\u00a0bland and uninspiring (I can't draw in other way).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T07:18:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aab287f87dc3d2b6ab0abb6f09c5df1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lentinant"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
