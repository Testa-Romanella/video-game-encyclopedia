As the last bastion of defence on the border between the wildlands and the human realm, you must defend the stronghold and protect the lives of those in the human realm. This keep has seen many sieges and has taken a lot of damage over the years. Luckily recent advances in the arcane arts have led to improved measures of defence, beyond our quick archer towers or the heavy slow cannon towers. Best of luck and defend the keep at all costs!</p>\n<p>Goblins spawn from the woods and will take the shortest route to the keep. Careful where you place our tower as resources are scares and we can not afford to break down or replace any placed towers. Goblins are smart and will change their route if there is a different shorter path.</p>\n<p><strong>Music by</strong>: Kerziv</p>\n<p><strong>Track Name</strong>: Village<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Available at:\u00a0</strong>https://kerziv.itch.io/retrofantasy1</p>\n<p><strong>Game Inspiration:</strong> Based on Gamedev.tv's Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D course</p>\n<p><strong>Coding:\u00a0</strong> Zirk Coetsee</p>\n<p><strong>3D Art:</strong> Zirk Coetsee</p>\n<p><strong>UI:</strong> Zirk Coetsee</p>\n<p><strong>Environment and setting:</strong> Zirk Coetsee</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Click W/A/S/D or Arrows to move the camera</li><li>R and F to Zoom in and out</li><li>Q and E to rotate\u00a0the camera</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Mouse Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Click and drag the right mouse button to move the camera</li><li>Click and drag the left mouse button to place Towers</li><li>Scroll the middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out</li><li>Click and drag the middle mouse wheel to rotate the camera</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T10:48:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45bc53d6550aa7d542342f93f76f4f4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Zirk Coetsee"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
