In this episode you will be the main character Shadow (Alex Summer) who runs an international criminal empire. You will be attacked by few goons and you have to kill them all before they kill you. This is also a first person shooter game. You can use the mouse pointer to aim and click the mouse button to shoot. The most interesting feature of this game is that if you shoot the goons and they don't die, you have to shoot at the places surrounding the attackers to kill them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/334/3342ff9a5aa3d63b809ba1c5056f48e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Riad Arifin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Riad Arifin"], "esrb_rating": null}
