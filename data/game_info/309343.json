There isn't anything special about this one, but you can play it if you want to.</p>\n\n<p>There are currently three enemy types:<br/></p>\n<p>Chasers are the basic enemies, they just chase you around.</p>\n<p>Ballistics are slow, but fire extremely quick projectiles.</p>\n<p>Behemoths are huge (hence the name), move slightly slower than Chasers, and take several hits to defeat. Upon death, they will release projectiles in eight directions.</p>\n\n<p>There are currently two different power-ups:</p>\n<p>Area Shot lets you fire projectiles in eight directions for a short time.</p>\n<p>Super Projectile pierces through Chasers, kills Ballistics and Behemoths in one hit, and gives double points for enemy kills.</p>\n\n<p>Use the arrow keys\u00a0to move, press\u00a0X to shoot, and press\u00a0ESC to quit.</p>\n<p>If you press \"E\" on the game over screen, you will be surprised.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T03:09:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4c/d4cf087fc125cbf859110fe508e89c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr. Shellduck"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
