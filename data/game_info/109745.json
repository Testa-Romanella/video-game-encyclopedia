The old one from 1986 to be exact! When the theme of <strong>Shapeshift</strong> was announced, I knew I had my outlet. Different avatars with unique abilities enabled me to let myself make that sort of metroidvania level design we know and love.</p><p>Sadly, I think I tried to do too much in the 48 hours I was given. The pixel art is incredibly rushed, and the game lacks a lot of the little details that give a game it's charm. There's no silly intro like in Synergy Shakedown, nor is the win/lose screen terribly rewarding. Next time, I'll have to remind myself to keep the scope small and focus on a good core.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b83/b837970f19b8c80b8a822c24f728e532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daniel Savage"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
