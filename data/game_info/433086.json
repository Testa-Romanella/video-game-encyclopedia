{"id": 433086, "slug": "dont-make-a-sound-2", "name": "Don't Make a Sound", "name_original": "Don't Make a Sound", "description": "<strong>Don't Make a Sound\u00a0</strong>\n<p>- is a game that can provide a unique experience to the person playing it. It puts you in the place of a robot that has to use echolocation to see. You'll be able to make a sound to see your surroundings for a limited amount of time every 7 seconds by pressing E. This sound is fairly loud, so make sure you're not wearing headphones at max volume when pressing E. Alternatively, you'll also be able to touch your surroundings to see them; this won't be too effective when you're jumping over gaps, however.</p>\n<p>The movement controls in the game are the same as most 2D Platformer games; A to move left, D to move right, W to jump. The controls to move between different options in the title screen are W and S; to select an option, simply press Enter. The controls for the game's main mechanic, echolocation, have been listed in the previous paragraph. You can press Escape at any time to turn Fullscreen mode on or off.</p>\n<p>Some of the walls in the game will only be seen by touch, and some only by echolocation. Some walls will also fade away if you spend too much time touching them; they'll come back in a couple of seconds if you give them some space. Whenever you will encounter a new wall or feature in the game, there will be a room dedicated to letting you get used to the new mechanics.</p>\n<p>The game saves automatically at the start of each room. Any checkpoints you have in that room are not saved, and you will be put back to the start of the room you were in when you load the game. If the game closes down on its own, that usually means that you've progressed further in the game.</p>\n<p>This game can be <strong>very challenging</strong> and possibly <strong>rage inducing</strong>. Any feedback is appreciated.</p>\n<p>I have a discord server!
