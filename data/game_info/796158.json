Find the key then get to the door. There's 12 levels with a final boss at the end. About 1\u00a0 hour of gameplay, but If you want to go back and collect all the stars &amp; monster tokens then maybe 2 hours.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0made this game for my 6 year old daughter. She said she wanted to make a game, then proceeded to draw out levels and monsters in crayon. I\u00a0took those drawings and made a game for her so we could play it together. I also consulted her on how most of the mechanics should work.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T10:32:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97d/97db9add80c13260ed88409678252663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fib"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
