{"id": 590363, "slug": "thermonuclear-domination", "name": "Thermonuclear Domination", "name_original": "Thermonuclear Domination", "description": "<p>Thermonuclear Domination is a small and simple turn-based game for Windows, for 1 to 4 players.</p>\n<p>Players take turns in aiming and firing nuclear weapons using a simple angle/range system. Each side has missile silos, cities, factories and submarines to control. One hidden city houses the enemy headquarters, destroy this and the enemy will lose.<br/><br/>Thermonuclear Domination is simple and fun to play, and you get to destroy the world too.</p>\n<p>It was developed and released in 1998 and only uses the Windows API so should work on every version of Windows (even Windows 95). Includes a modern fancy pdf manual.</p>\n<p>A few years later I made a swanky modern 3D version of this game called Radioactive. Happy apocalypsing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfe/bfe83cb876cb04c3ca576b52f5cc98fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cornutopia Software"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
