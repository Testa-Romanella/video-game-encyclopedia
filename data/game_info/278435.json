{"id": 278435, "slug": "fragile-equilibrium-itch", "name": "Fragile Equilibrium (itch)", "name_original": "Fragile Equilibrium (itch)", "description": "<p>Fragile Equilibrium is a game about the imperfection and impermanence of life. It is a reflection on transience, a balancing act between progress and regrowth, a reminder to find beauty in decay and inevitable destruction. Using old-school \u201cshmup\u201d mechanics and forms, [FE] invites the player to explore a world of quick actions, forced decisions, and subtle strategy: but with each decision, the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplayer falls ever out of balance.<br/></p>\n<p> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs balance decays so does the world, eroding over time and out of space, binding the player to a smaller area, pressing in upon the mind. Built upon multi-layered interactions, a Wabi Sabi aesthetic idealism, and a rich, broken world of yesterdays fantasies, [FE] asks the player to reflect upon their play, their world, their nostalgia, and themselves.  <strong>Find your balance, live a life well played.</strong></p>\n<p>As a work of art, [FE] is a thinly veiled allegory for dealing with depression and anxiety: it is intended specifically to create in the player the sense of being 'squeezed', a slowly building pressure and feeling of being trapped, and to lead players to reflect on balancing their forward progress with a constant need to reconsider, rebuild, and refocus on internally facing (i.e. inward facing) issues and obstacles.  It challenges players to find a <strong>Fragile Equilibrium</strong> in their own play, as a metaphor for conveying issues of instability.</p>\n<p>Fragile Equilibrium is copyright MAGIC Spell Studios, LLC, 2018-2019.\u00a0 All rights Reserved.\u00a0 Fragile Equilibrium was produced in residence at the Rochester<br/></p>\n<p>Institute of Technology and the RIT MAGIC Center under the direction of Professor Andrew Phelps.\u00a0 MAGIC Spell Studios and the associated logo are trademarks of MAGIC Spell Studios, LLC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/516c88a2d2e32b3a0b33e13d33224507.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andy Phelps"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
