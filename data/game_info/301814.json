{"id": 301814, "slug": "hikari-and-the-forest-salvation", "name": "Hikari and the Forest Salvation", "name_original": "Hikari and the Forest Salvation", "description": "<p>This is a project for a game jam over a Year ago while I was a total newbie with Unreal Engine 4, but still wanted to do something on my own, because it was my first game jam. The music and some assets (like the bushes and trees) are from some free UE4 projects\u00a0 (you can find them on the \"learn\" tab in the Launcher).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I wouldn't actually upload this, but many requested it. It may have some performance issues and the way the player speed is calculated is with event tics, which seems to be a problem if the fps is low on your machine (then the main character moves slower than intended). This was the movement method from one \"example project\" at that time, so I thought it was alright on every way. Today I would change many things, like the title name, movement, bullet-blueprints, patterns,\u00a0adding a loading screen and more. <br/></p>\n\n<p>How To Play:</p>\n<p>Move -&gt; arrow keys.<br/>Fire/Shoot -&gt; SpaceBar<br/>Focus (making the character movement slower and shooting straight) -&gt; Left Shift</p>\n<p>Avoid getting hit at the Head (it's the only hitbox you should be aware of, aside from the bullets).</p>\n<p>You have a limited number of lives. The more foliage will appear if the score is higher.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f9/4f98d5159d8ec1bdba6b2ca98621ffd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XXYOTH"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
