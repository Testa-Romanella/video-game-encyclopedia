Its going to be a 2d platformer with multiple gamemodes and features that this prototype is greatly lacking. <br/></p>\n<p>You play as a squirrel hopping around a giant oak tree collecting acorns before the timer goes down. To finish the game you have to run up to the burrow you spawn next to and hit 'w' to enter it. Keep in mind you dont need to collect all the acorns to finish the level.</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback is welcomed and wanted.</p>\n\n<p>controls:</p>\n<p>'a' and 'd' or arrow keys to walk</p>\n<p>'Space' - Jump<br/></p>\n<p>'w' - Enter burrow</p>\n<p>While holding the movement keys you can stick to platforms and hit space at the same time to jump up them. An unintended feature I plan to implement in the complete version of the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:14:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/396/396042fd9a2bcfd0d2ce246a47f036d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stumpy Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
