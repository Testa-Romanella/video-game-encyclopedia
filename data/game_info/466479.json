You start with pushing the main bomb towards a direction and burning its fuse, but you must aim carefully! Find the best direction to blow\u00a0every single bomb up!</p>\n<p>This game was made for Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2020, where the theme is \"Out of Control\". This game fits the theme by having bombs completely out of control for you once you throw it. The bombs also move totally unexpectedly when there are a lot of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Developed by</strong><br/>AliYil</p>\n<p><strong>With the\u00a0help of</strong><br/>hyggelig &amp; AliCenn</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/>bensound.com (Benjamin Tissot)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Font</strong><br/>Karmatic Arcade by Vic Fieger</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:49:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a9570e3c6d3cf01dc1992ba233a684f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AliYil", "AliCenn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
