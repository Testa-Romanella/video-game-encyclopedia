By using props to strengthen one's abilities, the originally weak characters can gradually grow, but if one is not careful, they may be shattered to pieces. The most frustrating thing inside is not being killed by the enemy, but being blown up by oneself. Especially when I am stuck in a dead end and cannot see the King of Hell immediately, I can only wait for the moment when the bomb I set down by my own wrongdoing slowly explodes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n1.
