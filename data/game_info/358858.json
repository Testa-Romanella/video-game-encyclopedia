Adventure awaits! However, before they can trust you with actual field missions, you'll have to prove your worth. This is why you ended up in\u00a0Testing Chamber A115, a.k.a The Escape House. You'll have to figure your way out with your sanity intact in order to be accepted as a member of the team. Good luck!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Escape House features a mixture of puzzle solving and classic adventure game mechanics all wrapped up in an escape room style environment. You'll have to combine the clues from your limited surroundings to get ahead and beat the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As with a regular escape room, the expected play time is around 60 minutes. This varies\u00a0between 30 and 120 minutes based on your familiarity with puzzles. However there's no clock stopping you, so take your time and don't feel pressured.</p>\n<p>If you do get stuck, there are multiple hints available for each puzzle in the pause menu. So don't get frustrated when you can't seem to figure out a particular detail.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy it and if you have any feedback for me, if you've found a bug or a glitch, feel free to leave a comment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T09:57:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/5973eb5c8888f3b977dad9aab91fabd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["WittyWare"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
