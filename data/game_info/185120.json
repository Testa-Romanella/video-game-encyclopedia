Another way to play is to try and stop a building collapsing or to escape a collapsing building. Often this won't be possible with just one person. You can do whatever you want to do! Abandoning your friend in need is even more fun with large blocks of concrete and very poorly designed trees. Pushing your friend off a ledge is super fun so get this game!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Player 1: WASD, and Left Control to grab.</p>\n<p>Player 2: Up, Down, Left Right and\u00a0 .\u00a0 to grab.</p>\n<p>n to go the the next level, r to go to a random one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6a/a6a2c4d7d25787726c22983e1f2df3c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["IncandescentStool"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
