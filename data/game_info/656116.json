Just like when\u00a0Narcissus died, and a flower grew on the exact spot and the flower is called Narcissus.</p>\n<p>The third part is the Rare Blue Hunter\u2019s Moon on Halloween day (31 October 2020) which is visible to the world in all time zone (appeared last\u00a0in 1944 and 2020),\u00a0 appears on Halloween day (once every 19 years) and have mythological storytelling of the spiritual realm and more.</p>\n<p>Suitable for all age levels, this is a fun and creative game which enables the player to memorise as well as enjoy random-puzzle challenges while\u00a0it focuses on the Creative Sector.</p>\n<p><strong>THE GAME</strong></p>\n<p>In this game, after Athena turned Arachne into a spider and terror came upon all creatives (artists and craft person), the search for a new craft\u00a0goddess who is supportive begins.</p>\n<p>In this timed game of twenty seconds for each scene, the game starts with the player looking at the artwork of Athena, the artwork starts fading\u00a0to prevent recreation. The artwork returns in puzzling pieces and the player need to place the puzzle pieces in their proper position. Pomegranate, the mystery fruit, and score increase are the rewards anytime a puzzle piece is placed correctly.</p>\n<p>The player is teleported into Athena\u2019s Isometric Maze Treasure Chamber or room to collect icons of the creative industry listed on the right of the\u00a0screen. Athena\u2019s Statue chases the player.</p>\n<p>The player is then teleported to the place of The Blue Hunter\u2019s Moon to be turned into a goddess or sacrificed. The player tries to get to the Moon\u00a0\u00a0Castle without colliding with any Halloween Worshipper while the moon phases (new moon, waning crescent, waning gibbous, third quarter, waxing\u00a0crescent waxing gibbous, first quarter) rotating in their own axes protect the player. If the player wins the Moon in its Lunar Corona crowns the\u00a0player as the new goddess but if the player loses, the moon turns into a blood moon and the player is clothed in red.</p>\n<p>The score for the first section is 11 and turns into 12 because there is a significant with numbers. 12 is the number of perfection.</p>\n<p>The score for the second section is 22 and turns into 24 because it is double completion.</p>\n<p>The score of the third section is 84 while the total score is 120 years because this is to be the maximum years of God's Spirit to dwell with a man\u00a0on the earth as stated in the Holy Bible.</p>\n<p>*Instructions for each scene are listed in the menu and on-screen notification pops in each scene as a reminder of what is required for the gameplay.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Goal</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to become the new craft goddess by overthrowing Athena.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The challenge of the game is in different sections.
