However, this time dementia got the best of you and you forgot to feed the ducks. Now they're angry and out to get you! <br/><br/>Use the left and right arrow keys to \"waddle\" forwards, and hold both keys simultaneously to swing your walker at those dastardly drakes! As you do this, your stamina will decrease (left bar), you will slow down and your heart rate starts to rise. Don't let your heart rate get too high or you'll get a heart attack! Also don't step into puddles or you might catch a cold. <br/><br/>Controls: <br/>Right and left arrow keys - move <br/>Both - attack (hold to charge) <br/><br/>Programmed in Dart using WebGL. <br/><br/>Music by Kevin MacLeod <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b919627c2d0d6590c84ab31879a93b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ronin748"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
