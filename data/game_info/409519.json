As an Engine I used the Unity Engine. All the Pixel Art is drawn by myself with the PixilArt Website, as well as all the Animations, which are a little bit wonky because I've never done 2D Animation before. The music is generated via. Ecrett Music and all other Sound Effects are made with SFXR. As the them of the Game Jam is \"Cold\", i started with a Basic Jump'n'Run, but recognised after some play testing that my idea was just to shallow to be a real Game. After that my idea was to create a Survival Plattformer where you have to find you're Igloo before you freeze.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>A\u00a0D / \u2b05\ufe0f\u00a0 , \u27a1\ufe0f\u00a0</strong>\u00a0- Run<br/><strong>LEFT SHIFT / \u2b07\ufe0f</strong>\u00a0- Crouch<br/><strong>SPACE / W </strong>- Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdbd847e2070b21545becfea8f9f8aae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MathewHD"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
