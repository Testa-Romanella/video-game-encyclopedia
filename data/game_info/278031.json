If they reach it, you\u2019re dead. You play through a radar interface using your sensor cone to detect enemies approaching the center. Gameplay randomness ensure they won't always appear on the same point every time you play, so be careful. You must destroy each enemy at the precise moment that your sensor gets in contact with it. If you fail, the enemy will come closer by and you will ultimately lose!<br/><br/>Compete in online leaderboards for the highest rank and challenge your friends by sharing your score in social media.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><ul><li>Crafted electronic music with underwater theme, 12 different tracks.<br/></li><li>Unique and eye-catching graphics with different styles for each song.<br/></li><li>Procedural levels, balanced between rhythm and randomness so each song is different every time you play.<br/></li><li>Cross-platform play and saves.
