{"id": 863710, "slug": "winter-is-coming-gamedev-project1-elaboration", "name": "Winter Is Coming (GameDev Project1 Elaboration)", "name_original": "Winter Is Coming (GameDev Project1 Elaboration)", "description": "<p>This is a small puzzle game in which a great snowstorm is created by the pissed-off wizard living in the castle in the east, and the player will receive a quest from the old man living in the village, to go past the monster on the way and get to the castle before the storm destroys the village. The player can use WASD or arrows to control movements and click on the NPCs to start conversations.</p>\n<p>I spent most of my time on a new textbox generation system because I found the original one I made for the clone is not flexible and seemed too rough. So I found many tutorials on youtube and forums (mostly learned from a youtube named\u00a0Peyton Burnham) I successfully learned how to write scripts from these researches and realized the effect of typing effect when generating the letters and making the length of the sentence fit the length of the textbox. I originally planned to make a randomly-generated storm that follows the player and disappears when it hits a solid object, however, I was stuck at the randomization part and cannot make what I want. I think this part is unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Sound effects &amp; Music Credit</p><p>Door opening:\u00a0American McGee\"s Alice, link:https://www.aigei.com/view/61808.html</p><p>Monster speaking: https://www.aigei.com/item/weird_alien_spe.html</p><p>Get item:https://www.aigei.com/item/game_sounds_gam_485.html</p><p>Game End:https://www.aigei.com/item/you_xi_shi_bai.html</p><p>NPC speaking: dersuperanton, Link:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/dersuperanton/sounds/435876/</p><p>Wind howling: Fission9, Link: https://freesound.org/people/Fission9/sounds/521820/</p><p>Background music: Mrthenoronha, Link:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Mrthenoronha/sounds/380020/</p><p>Art Inspired by :</p><p>RPG Maker MV - Legends of Russia - Winter Village Tiles</p><p>Link:https://store.steampowered.com/app/1565360/RPG_Maker_MV__Legends_of_Russia__Wint...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T23:15:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298757569e9f93d12c92bc2c87395df3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Keyi03"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
