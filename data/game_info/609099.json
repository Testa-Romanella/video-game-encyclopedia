I choose <strong>RHYTHM GAME and BULLET HELL!</strong></p>\n<p>Theme:\u00a0<strong>REUSABLE</strong>. I made one reusable ability, that <strong>recharges slower and slower the more you use it!</strong></p>\r\nCONTROLS\u00a0\r\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys:\u00a0move the GLORIOUS WIZARD PIANIST around<br/>J-K-L-B-N-M (pick one or all, as you like it):\u00a0play notes when they touch the red flaming line</p>\n<p>SPACE BAR:\u00a0use the SPECIAL ABILITY. It clears all the projectiles, but it charges slower the more you use it, so be careful.</p>\r\nGOAL\u00a0\r\n<p>Defeat all the monsters, dodge all the bullets, stay alive until your epic performance ends. Show must go on!</p>\r\nGAMEPLAY\u00a0\r\n<p>Dodge enemy bullets and play your glorious notes.<br/>Playing a correct note creates a fireball that goes toward the nearest enemy, erasing it from the existence once and for all. <br/>Missing a note or taking a hit reduces your health (HP bar). Tip:\u00a0a dead pianist can not play.<br/>Use your special ability when it's full\u00a0to clear all the projectiles on screen. Tip:\u00a0a dead pianist can not use a special ability.</p>\r\nFEATURES\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>original composed song (want the sheet?\u00a0Get it here:\u00a0https://musescore.com/user/2235246/scores/1245331)</li><li>a lot of\u00a0different enemies to delete</li><li>online leaderboard! Show you are the one</li></ul>\r\nDISCLAIMER: this game is hard.\r\n<p>Everytime I see \"rhythm bullet hell\" I know that the game is never going to really be a rhythm bullet hell, but instead just a coreographed bullet hell, where projectiles spawn following the music, and there is nothing rhythm-game-like involved.\u00a0Well, I wanted to make a true rhythm bullet hell, where you play notes and dodge bullets, so here we are!</p>\r\nCREDITS:\u00a0\r\n<p>Sprites are from OpenGameArt under CC0 License.\u00a0<br/>Music &amp;\u00a0coding are made by myself.<br/>Sound effects from jfxr.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T06:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f1/2f1002202e72dc84c98a8a35a03caa8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["omagerio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
