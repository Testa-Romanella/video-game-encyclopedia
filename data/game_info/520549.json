We had a few ways we wanted to implement this, but primarily focused on the characters. They were designed in different shapes and sizes to emphasise this message. We avoided human features so they could be accessible to all kinds of gamers, without isolating anyone. That said, there was somewhat of an emphasis on the representation of differently abled people, such as designing one character with prosthetics. They also have different abilities, and all of them are needed to win the game. This was to help enforce the message that everybody is valuable and has their own merits to be proud of. For accessibility, we made the game so it would suit all age ranges, and could also be played by colour blind players, as patterns are used as well as colour ques. The main basis of the theme was the supposed Einstein quote: \u201cEveryone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.\u201d This quote summarises the message of the game that we should not judge people by the same standards set by society, but as individuals with our own merits and experiences.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>W/A/S/D - Movement</p><p>Space - Jump/Double-Jump</p><p>Left-Click - Character Ability</p><p>P - Pause</p><p>Q - Change Character</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T03:25:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/397/397fccdc204d1a9d14d9564f104cf039.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charlie Clark"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
