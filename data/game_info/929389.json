Avoid the masked entity in your dreams and collect all 5 bells to wake up.</p>\n<p>Some quick notes, this game was created in one week for the Brackey's game jam. Halfway through the jam, my cat of 15 years named Skye passed away. I've had her since I was 8 years old and the loss was absolutely heartbreaking I feel more as though I lost a sibling than a pet. As a result, I nearly dropped out of the jam but I decided to finish the game in her honor. She slept on my lap every day that I worked on this game and finishing it was a way to feel close to her now that she's gone. However, for obvious reasons, I did not put in as much time as I originally planned and as a result, there is some jank.</p>\n<p>Bare in mind that there is voice acting to provide more context but I did not have time to implement the audio files, additionally, I have uploaded two builds. Build 2 has an ending but has been less tested, both have messed up credits sequences and title screens. Pick your poison, the game will be fully polished after the jam concludes and I can make changes again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T09:44:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6db5d36f8d1e443b6d1456a8b3b4eef3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AudioDread"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
