No ROMs are included with the game, so you'll have to obtain them yourself by legal means.</p>\n<p>Currently the game can only be played using a controller, sorry :c I'm trying to figure out a way to support mouse + keyboard.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This project is still a work in progress, all feedback and especially bug reports are highly appreciated! There's a known bug where the ROM menu appears to be empty when you first select it, so if that happens, just go back to the main menu and click \"Pick ROM\" again.</p>\n<p>Dev log: https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=65347.0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/021f16d0f6053b8e2addf6daece0a18b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nekromantikko"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
