In this game, in order to <strong>solve the puzzles</strong> and <strong>slay the queens</strong>, you need to think your way through...</p>\r\nCaution\r\n\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>HTML build</strong> of the game <strong>has certain bugs</strong> related to the scene lightning. The <strong>bugs </strong>in question <strong>do not exist</strong> <strong>in the Windows build</strong> of the game.</p>\r\nSummary\r\n\r\n<p>The game increases in difficulty as you clear levels and sub-levels. There are a total of <strong>3 levels with 13 sub-levels</strong> each with increasing difficulty. Each level has a different tile layout. The first level starts with 3x3 tiles, and it goes up to 5x5 by the last level.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>To clear</strong> each sub-level, you need to <strong>make every tile red</strong>, which is your queen's color. Your mouse clicks change the tiles' orientation where you click in a 3-by-3 area. <strong>During the first few sub-levels</strong> of the game, <strong>you'll get the idea</strong> of this mechanic without hesitation.</p>\n<p>There also is a <strong>click limit </strong><strong>for each sub-level</strong>, indicating <strong>how many clicks you can make</strong> to change the orientation of each tile to red. To clear harder sub-levels, you must focus on the game and <strong>try to see a couple of clicks ahead</strong>.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the list of essential controls.</p>\n<p>Navigation: <em>LMB</em></p>\n<p>Options: <em>O</em></p>\n<p>Mute Music/Sound: <em>M/V</em></p>\r\nCredits\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n<p>Ata Deniz Oktay - Game Design &amp; Programming</p>\r\nAssets\r\n<p>Cards &amp; UI Elements -\u00a0Devlyn JD</p>\n<p>Music - ChillMindscapes</p>\n<p>Sound Effects - calltheforest</p>\n<p>Font -\u00a0Speak the Sky</p>\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\n\r\n<p>Many heartfelt thanks to the creators of the <strong>Super Mario 64\u00a0minigames</strong> \"Puzzle Panel\" and \"Puzzle Panic,\" which both created great childhood memories...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:06:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a1ed32a686985207a457987df97cd9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Beez"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
