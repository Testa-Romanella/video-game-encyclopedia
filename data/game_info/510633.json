Navigate him through a chaotic, ever-changing level while chasing down a fleeting heart.<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay is relatively simple: Try to reach the Red Heart before time runs out! Every time you reach the Red Heart, you get a little more time before the Red Heart moves to a new location. Collect White Hearts for points, and survive as long as you can! The level shifts around constantly, so watch your step!</p>\n<p>This game took a lot of effort to make, and this version has almost none of the features I\u00a0wanted to add in. I feel like I'd definitely continue this project, just because of how much potential I\u00a0think it has!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: Move</p>\n<p>Z: Jump</p>\n<p>X: Hook</p>\n<p>Space: Skip cutscene (as long as you played the game before)</p>\n<p>Backspace: Skip straight to game (as long as you played the game before)</p>\n\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Sunfished -\u00a0https://twitter.com/sunfished\u00a0- Programmer/Designer/Sounds</p>\n<p>SpookOS - https://twitter.com/SpookOS_\u00a0- Spriter/Play Tester</p>\n<p>Gravity Monkey -\u00a0https://twitter.com/GravityMonkey1\u00a0- Spriter/Designer/Graphics</p>\n<p>modeling clay - Graphics</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Placeholder music provided\u00a0by\u00a0https://www.bensound.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:39:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00d/00d5bf738deb3a7d7d1e441cb3aa07f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sun"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
