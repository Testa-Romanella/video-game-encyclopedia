Your spells can become corrupt by the cursed magic that controls the golems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will lose control of a spell if it becomes corrupt, and it will become harmful if it touches you, so be mindful about how many spells you cast!</p>\n<ul><li>How To Play:</li></ul>\n<p>Run with with (WASD or Left Controller\u00a0Joystick), or Press and hold (LMB or Right Controller Bumper) to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Hold for longer to create a bigger spell, and release to unleash it. the bigger the spell, the slower it moves and the more golems it can hit!</p>\n<p>You can control the direction of your spell by using (Mouse or Right Controller Joystick). you can also run around while controlling a spell, so multitasking is key!</p>\n<p>If a new spell is cast, a spell hits a wall once or hits a golem too many times, the spell will become <strong>Corrupt </strong>and you will lose control of that spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells under your control will only hurt Golems, while corrupt spells will only hurt you.</strong></p>\n<p>Use narrow gaps in the environment to your advantage. Spells will linger until the end of the wave. Cast fewer, slower spells to stop things from getting out of control</p>\n<ul><li>Known Bugs/Issues</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Spells will instantly kill you if you start casting them too close to a wall</li><li>Golems can't hit the player when the player is standing too close to spawn pillars in a certain way</li></ul>\n<p>PS; I did create all art and code\u00a0for the game myself, though I\u00a0didn't have time to replace/remove a couple placeholder Kenney assets used for white pillars/walls, despite having my own model finished in Blender. Music from Incompetech, and sound effects from PMsfx.com\u00a0were used in this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:00:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/231/231e9d019c83ef2dd9f604259e8c1257.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheShadyColombian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
