The mechanic is, in my opinion, a great idea, one which can create some very tense situations, but I must admit that the end result is not really the greatest at achieving that. Still, it's a pretty fun way to spend five minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T08:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/507/50728a99fd680571fd21eb8d1ecb053b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dusq"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
