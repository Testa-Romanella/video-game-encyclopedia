The role-playing game dates from the early days of the German  Maker scene and is now considered one of its classics. It tells the  story of the ever-so-slightly clich\u00e9d hero Grandy, who has to stop the  vampire Wahnfried, with the help of his friends - and a lot of wit.\r\n</p>\n<p>Upon  its release, the game received widespread critical acclaim and managed  to generate interest even outside the Maker community. It was included  several times on the issue CD of Bravo Screenfun and other magazines and  made it into the download sections of numerous large portals. In the  German community, the popularity of Unterwegs in D\u00fcsterburg was only  ever matched by Vampires Dawn.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game contains about 20 to 40 hours worth of content.

And as they say in D\u00fcsterburg:\u00a0The day does not last forever, and the night belongs to the vampires.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Tvtropes page: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnterwegsInDuesterburg</p>\n<p>Official page: https://duesterburg.rpg-atelier.net/aktuell.php</p>\n<p>Complete English walkthrough: https://lparchive.org/Unterwegs-in-Duesterburg/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T15:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b662851e343c6fc14d21f24bfdd4c0d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aranael"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
