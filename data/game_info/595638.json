Only one way to get that : dig up all the trash that you can to resell it. The deeper it is, the better the junk.<br/></p>\n<p>So dig deep, and dig even deeper. Made in 3 days for Ludum Dare</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>A and D key to move left and right. (Arrow keys also work !)</p>\n<p>Press the space bar repeatedly to fly.</p>\n<p>Press the S key to start digging, and when you have found an item, mash that S key to dig it up ! (You don't need to actually mash. There's a cooldown.)</p>\n<p>Beware that you can only dig while you're in a run. Why not explore a bit before you start ?</p>\n\r\nF.A.Q.\r\n<ul><li><strong>\u00a0Is the game infinite ? Can I gather points forever ?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>No, it has an end ! How about you check out the shop ?</p>\n<ul><li><strong>\u00a0I don't know what to do ?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Start a new run by interacting with the flag. Dig the ground, look at the distance, dig again, and do that until you find the right spot. Then DIG !</p>\n<ul><li><strong>\u00a0How is that bird so handsome ?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0Oh, you noticed ? I heard he's single.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>\u00a0 Can you play my entry ?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0Sure thing ! Quickest way to contact me is just to reach out on Twitter. If you don't like the bird (how could you ?) there's always the rest at my LinkTree.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>\u00a0 Who worked on the game ?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0This is my creation from start to finish (hence the bugs and the mediocre jokes).</p>\n<p>You can play the game <strong>in your browser</strong>, right now. It takes <strong>around 10 minutes to play</strong>.</p>\n<p>Please consider leaving a rating ! Constructive criticism is encouraged, but please don't be too harsh, as this is only something that I did for fun and to challenge myself.</p>\n<p>Alright, see you around !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:49:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e98/e9897c6c5fda70dbb757e8758c48b2f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Glaas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
