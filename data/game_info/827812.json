This game is a less ambitious project that I\u2019m going to complete before my main project.</p>\n<p>Your feedback, any feedback, is supremely valuable. If you have an itch.io account you can leave a comment below, or send them to webmaster@teddykaboom.com,\u00a0 or any other means you have of getting ahold of me.</p>\n<p>This page will become more salesy and fun later on, but for now has to suffice as the instruction manual.\u00a0</p>\r\nSuper Bean Caravan\r\n<p>The Legumi are a secret race of bean-devouring creatures. They have a legend, and that is that True Happiness is somewhere out in the world, but no one alive has made the trek.\r\n</p>\n<p>In <em>Super Bean Caravan,</em> you play as a young legumi, and your goal is to explore each corner of the land looking for <strong>wisdom houses</strong> which open the path to <strong>True Happiness</strong>.\u00a0\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Along the way, you\u2019ll keep yourself alive by finding, harvesting, and eating <strong>beans</strong>, which add time to your life, and also produce two <strong>pips</strong>. Pips are tiny, explosive seeds that can be thrown at monsters to frighten them away.\r\n</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>The game is controlled with the arrow keys, space bar, and \u201cP\u201d button.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>The <strong>arrow keys</strong> move your legumi around the world map, and are also used to navigate menus.\r\n</li><li>The<strong> space bar</strong> makes you eat a bean. If some other action is displayed over your legumi\u2019s head, (enter, bounce, chat,) it performs that action instead.\r\n</li><li><strong>\u201cP\u201d</strong> pauses the game. From here you can see your beans, pips, time, money, and how many nearby wisdom houses you\u2019ve visited.\r\n</li><li>You can also <strong>stand still</strong> to see how many beans, pips, and seconds of life you have remaining.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nOBJECTS\r\n<p>While traversing the world, things will appear as a distant glisten\u00a0 until you get close enough to see what they are. Here are some things you might come across.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong><em>\u00a0\u00a0</em>Beanstalks </strong>will drop three beans if you walk into them. Those beans will regrow after sixty seconds. They are fairly rare, and tend to grow in green, natural areas, as well as around legumi settlements.\u00a0</li><li><strong><em>\u00a0</em>Monsters </strong>will chase and attack you as soon as they come into view, forcing you into a battle. I\u2019ll go into more detail about battles below, but suffice it to say, if you\u2019re not sure what something is, make sure you\u2019re ready for battle before you approach!</li><li><strong>Treasure </strong>will appear as a glisten until you\u2019re right on top of it. Pick it up for some easy money! (Money doesn\u2019t do anything in the demo, but in the full game there will be shops to upgrade your character.)\r\n</li><li><strong>Mushrooms </strong>will bounce you towards a preset destination. Sometimes somewhere safe, always somewhere good.\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>Wisdom Huts</strong> contain wise old thinkers with musings to pass along. Visiting every wisdom house in an area opens up the portal to the next area.\r\n</li><li><strong>Portals </strong>is a fancy word for \u2018doors\u2019. They can be entered with the spacebar. Some remain hidden until all the nearby wisdom huts are visited.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nBEANS, PIPS, AND LIFE\r\n\n<p>You can hold ten beans, and ten pips. You start the game with five of each. You also have sixty seconds of life, which starts ticking down whenever you are outside a town.\u00a0\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>When you press spacebar to eat a bean, you will gain back ten seconds and also produce two pips.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Pips can be used in battles to scare monsters away.\r\n</p>\r\nBATTLES\r\n<p>When you encounter a monster on the overworld, it starts to pursue you the moment you\u2019re close enough to see it. When it reaches you, it\u2019s time to <strong>battle</strong>.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The legumi have two strategies to escape this danger, and they depend on the monsters\u2019 <strong>hunger</strong> and <strong>startle\u00a0</strong>numbers.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>The legumi can toss an equal number of beans to the monster\u2019s hunger. If the monster is satisfied, it will leave you alone.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>The legumi can throw any number of their pips, which will explode at a random volume number, (zero to three,) for a total explosion that matches or exceeds the monster\u2019s startle number, and scares it away.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>If you manage to beat the monster, they\u2019ll drop some money and leave you alone. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve heard the last of them; every monster has a cooldown, and once they\u2019re finished their break, they\u2019ll be on the lookout for you again.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes when you throw a pip, it won\u2019t explode. Luck of the Legumi dictates that there can only ever be one dud per throw.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Monsters won\u2019t attack you per se, but if they\u2019ve got you up against the wall with no beans and no pips, y'know,\u00a0they will kill you.\u00a0<br/>\n</p>\r\nTIPS\r\n<ul><li>Beans are life! Search the fields around town for some places to stock up, or your adventure will be over before it begins.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Crackijack are very brave, but all they want is a single bean. Conversely, Maunch Minors are very hungry but startle easily.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>The path to true happiness will become visible when the four wisdom houses are found. (Psst. It\u2019s up north.)\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T13:57:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f68/f680d11907f8a6d91249647d1ae5391b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Teddykaboom"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
