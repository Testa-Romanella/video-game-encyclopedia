The user is taken through an environment where they have a chance to interact with passing objects and unlock randomized submissions.\u00a0No two playthroughs will be the same.\u00a0<br/><br/>As more people contribute to the project, more levels will be added.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/>This project was designed for\u00a0TEDxTylerPark\u00a0and was built continuing in the themes of\u00a0collaboration, listening, and empathy\u00a0that drives most of my other work. At its core, I just want everyone to have the opportunity to learn from one another in unexpected, creative, honest, and engaging ways. It pairs extraordinary with ordinary, and was inspired by the\u00a0overview effect\u00a0that astronauts experience while looking at the Earth from space, 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami, Into The Magic Shop by James R. Doty, and my previous project:\u00a0Almost Something.<br/><br/>Though set in space, I wanted this project to reference the moments in which we sit down to try learn more about another person, and the missed connections that happen along the way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c45c974d1aba585c990462975ef13c83.jpg", "website": "https://www.goshwowalex.com/and-youre-there-too", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Serpentini"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alex Serpentini"], "esrb_rating": null}
