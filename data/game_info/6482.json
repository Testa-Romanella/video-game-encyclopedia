But the higher you get, the more you expose yourself to view - one wrong move and you&amp;#39;ll be TOASTED!<br/><br/>With subtle, ambient audio and music by Vector Lovers HEADPHONES are recommended... the sound of the wind builds as you ascend and the whine of the laser shifts frequency as the beam strikes different surfaces. Getting spotted by the CCTV will make you jump - again and again!<br/><br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/><br/>CONTROLS <br/><br/>TILT the device left or right to turn toward the left or right.<br/><br/>TILT the device away / towards you to look up and down.<br/><br/>TOUCH platforms or ground to move to that point. You can move a long way if the landing point is clearly visible. While moving you can still turn around - but you cannot start a new move until you have landed.<br/><br/>HOLD the LOOK BUTTON / MINI SCANNER to look at the CCTV Camera. Remember, the view might be blocked by a wall - if so, the CCTV can&amp;#39;t see you either! The MINI SCANNER shows the CCTV&amp;#39;s cone of vision as well as yourself (white dot) and any Drones (red dots).<br/><br/>PAUSE the game by touching the status bar at the top of the screen. <br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>BUGS &amp;amp; ISSUES: <br/><br/>iPhone 4 display issues fixed in this update!<br/>-----------------------------------------------", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c85/c85ed2a6f080f54eab8f0b0aa8bba646.jpeg", "website": "http://recluseindustries.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Recluse Industries"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Iwari.com"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
