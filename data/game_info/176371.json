The 9 day game jam was more like a 2 day game jam for me with a busy week, so I didn't get as much done as I would have liked but would still love for people to try it out and am excited to try out all the other games! Available on Windows and Android<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>Click (or tap!) and hold to charge power, release to throw water balloon. Hit 20 duders to get to level 2! (there's only two levels)\u00a0<br/>Escape to quit</p>\n<p>The game speeds up as you go, so get those hits in while you can!<br/><br/>Try hitting the swings on the first level and the bell and windows on the second level.</p>\n<p>Featuring all your favorites like Lockdown and the Grilled Cheese font!</p>\n<p>Made by John Scovic in Unity<br/>hit up my twitter @cool_guy_stuff</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b0/8b0db921d4f2a1a66afaf96845dbac42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["johnscovic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
