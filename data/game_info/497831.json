Get to the goal as a robot with limited abilities.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys / WASD - Move<br/>Space - Jump/Wall\u00a0Jump<br/>Z - Dash<br/>X - Climb<br/>C - Toggle Camera Mode<br/>M - Mute/unmute sound<br/>R - Restart Level<br/>Esc - Back to Title</p>\n<p>Note: it's not clear from the game's How To Play, but the wall jump is fundamentally different from a normal jump; you get more horizontal distance.</p>\n<p>Also, if you have trouble with keyboard input, try refreshing the page, or clicking the blue fullscreen button.</p>\n\n<p>This was fun to work on! There are a few bugs left, like the audio not looping properly or the wall jump timing being incredibly strict, but overall I'm very proud of this game. Learning how to use Unity and making all the art/music assets myself was a challenge, and I'm still not great at game design, but even then, I'm glad I could finish this project up and move on to working on something new.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:19:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9af/9afd64e02b11823544281032c597db70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alzhu1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
