Each level is split into two parts: an action zone and a \n      Royal Palace room. Action zones can be split up into several portions, \n      and contain power-ups, such as money bags, Mighty Coins, and Mighty \n      Drinks, usually hidden in treasure chests. Mighty Coins allow Jack to \n      change colors, and Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the game's timer. \n      However, be careful to not get greedy with collecting many too Mighty \n      Coins or Mighty Drinks. Otherwise, you'll find yourself doing jumping \n      jacks in the Torture Room!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
