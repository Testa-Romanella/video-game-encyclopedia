This is because you can cast magic spells. No mere superstition has driven your neighbors to drive you out however. Casting magic runs the risk of attracting dangerous magical beasts.</p>\n<p>This is my first game published as a solo game developer. Its main purpose was to create a game from start to finish in order to learn the entire process. So please do not feel any need to pay for the game, though any support for it is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>The game is complete as is, but could definitely be improved with updates. I have no intention currently of updating it, as I will be focusing my efforts on future game releases. However if there is sufficient interest in the game I am open to continued updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T10:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/888/8885bffe7c31627bcfc7954b72fe8332.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["smian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
