The night is still young and there's a mystery to be solved!<br/><br/><strong>A free, classic Point and Click Adventure</strong><br/><br/>This game is styled after old pre-2000s adventure games. This means bottomless pockets for any items you deem useful, dialog options and a story to click your way through. This time around you can even have thoughts in your inventory. Don't question it.
