For some reason, robots have decided to attack that room in particular, and to make matters worse, the only door is locked. Luckily, the door is locked only by a sort of electronic mechanism, so if you can figure out how to set off the EMP, you may be able to unlock the door and escape. Using a laser gun to fight, and spare batteries that were lying around to charge the EMP, you will find a way to hold off this horde of robots and escape with your life. This was made for Ludum Dare 39 (Running Out of Power).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/130/1309ea296c97fd16c3687ccbe5325aeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jasperarmstrong"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
