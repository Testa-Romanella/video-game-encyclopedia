The aim of the game is currently just to keep running along the procedurally generated canyon, and hopefully to have fun doing so, but my goal is to expand the game with potentially enemies and other threats to incentivise movement, and possibly some offensive actions as well.<br/><br/>Controls are simple: WASD to move, space to jump, and\u00a0escape to exit. To restart with a new canyon, you currently need to exit and reload the game.<br/><br/>At the moment, the game is mostly a tech demo as I implemented marching tetrahedra for the first time, as well as my own character controller. The controller as well as the canyon generation could definitely still use some work. Additionally, I aim to expand the game with enemies, and to add more details to the canyon in future generation, such as walkways, pillars, and so forth.<br/><br/>Please let me know what you think!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T08:40:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b5/0b5f7e7df13ae3e672e41f170d7ed987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ramperkash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
