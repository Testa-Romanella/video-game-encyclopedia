I was fascinated by these, and attempted to implement it myself. I had such fun (because I'm quite frankly a massive nerd) messing about with nodes and graphs that I decided to turn it into a game, written using DirectX 5 and C++. Years later, I ported it to XNA, but didn't finish it. Years LATER, I ported it once more to Unity, and after over a decade of off-on development, I'm proud to release the relaxing and zen-like PacketStorm.<br/><br/>In PacketStorm, you play an AI developing a new Internet Service Provider. Each game takes place over a few seconds of game-time, but potentially many hours of realtime. Buy up routers, upgrade cable networks and deal with packet jams as you earn money to research new and better upgrades. Move from running a small ISP over England to one spanning the entire world.<br/><br/>FREE BONUS - Learn the names and locations of almost every city in the world. It's like learning, but fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T03:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bf/9bfa5281456d3e7fca09b505c17ab1f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dmpdesign"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
