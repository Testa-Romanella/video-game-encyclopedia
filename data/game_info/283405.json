I also created this project to compare the same simple game with different levels of juiciness (you can check the evolution with the commits or the downloadable releases).<br/></p>\n<p>This one was made using Godot 3.0.6 (I might upgrade to 3.1 though). For the moment I like this engine a lot, it's really fun and intuitive to use.</p>\n<p>This game is open source, you can find the code here https://github.com/ashtrail/pew_godot.<br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The goal is to get the best score. You can increase said score by killing enemies (which you can do by shooting them). If you get touched 3 times it's game over.</p>\n<p><strong>Movement :</strong> WASD / Arrows<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Shooting :</strong> Left Click</p>\r\nChrome bug\r\n<p>The game might bug on Chrome, if this is the case you can either try using using Firefox instead, download the html build and serve it locally as instructed here, or download your OS specific archive and launch the executable.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music : https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/jazzy-frenchy</p>\n<p>Police : sea gardens regular https://www.1001fonts.com/sea-gardens-font.html</p>\n<p>Lastly my sister helped with some sound effects.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T03:59:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b7/6b7ff73809034f0157ada9b8b306c2d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ashtrail"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
