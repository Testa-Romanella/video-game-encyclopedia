Potentially in the future it'll have more complex gameplay mechanics and level designs. As it stands, though, it is pretty much a rip of:\u00a0Andi Mcclure's\u00a0<em>Jumpman</em>, Jason Rohrer's\u00a0<em>Inside a Star Filled Sky</em>, and Anna Anthropy's\u00a0<em>Mighty Jill Off</em>.<br/></p>\n<p>Class:\u00a0Pixel Prototype</p>\n<p>Assignment:\u00a0Make a game based on this image</p>\n<p>Postmortem: Overall, pretty in the middle on this one. Really happy with the visual effect, but the actual game is lackluster. The best part of it is a mechanic that is better implemented in a different game. It'll take some work to make it more interesting, but I think that it's fine given the timeframe it was made in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00b/00ba29a1ea2e062a7a817315b913a7a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoshMelnick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
