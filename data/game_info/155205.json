So, I changed her name to Michela.]<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>[Post-post update: Just sped up scrolling a bit, hopefully it'll work but send me feedback about it please as I don't have any kind of mouse on me.]</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game has a few jokes here and there but for the most part, it's mostly serious. I think.\r\nNote: That the rhythm game parts are somewhat lacking as getting the audio to sync took an incredible amount of time, and it only truly worked for the last part.\u00a0 Though the text-adventure parts are fine.</p>\n<p>And I'm still quite happy with the result.
