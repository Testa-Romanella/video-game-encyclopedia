When you gain enough points you can smash\u00a0 the dance floor by jumping and pressing Enter.</p>\n<p>This is a small game I did for Trijam 68, It took me about 5 to 6 hours to make.</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Keep Your Distance\", so the game features a dude with a face mask that tries to keep his distance from the people who are approaching him.</p>\n<p>The bad guys don't wear face masks to show they don't believe and don't care about COVID19.\u00a0They approach the dude with the face mask and they are\u00a0holding their phones. Originally I wanted to write a little dialog bubble above their heads that says that they don't believe that the COVID19 exists, but I didn't have enough time. Hence their phones (and the sync jumping they do) to resemble the brainwash.</p>\n<p>If you don't like the game that's fine - it's not a good game. I just wanted to try and do some cool effects and sync music to the gameplay. I didn't have time to actually think about good gameplay and other stuff - But I learned A LOT in the process of making this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T05:50:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcc/fcc56f5dbf1219bc523c5d83a2b3692d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rskedmi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
