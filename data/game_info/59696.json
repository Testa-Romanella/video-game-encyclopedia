The game features beautiful graphics by artist Mattahan coupled with a virtually endless variety of hand-designed, procedurally generated levels. We intend to change the way you think about runner games by designing on a much grander scale.<br />\nEach run begins in space. The player must traverse six beautifully painted layers of the atmosphere, alternating between skydiving and running on the backs of dragons on the perilous journey down to Earth. Unlike other runner games, there is an end \u2014 the planet\u2019s surface is the final world: EarthNight. You can learn the basic mechanics in a few minutes, but the game is hard to master. It takes time and dedication to develop the skills to reach EarthNight.<br />\nTraverse 6 layers of the atmosphere with unique mechanics, enemies, music and art.<br />\nUnlock over 35 power-ups by killing different dragons to help you on your journey to Earth.<br />\nCollect over 200 unique scraps, dragon eggs, and dragon pieces to upgrade your power-ups and the water tank on your ship.<br />\nPeal back hidden layers to discover all the secrets hidden beneath the surface.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T01:49:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/552b97814f130e94e65f740c9c798618.jpg", "website": "https://www.cleaversoft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 6, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 61, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 355, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "iOS", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["cleaversoft"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Cleaversoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
