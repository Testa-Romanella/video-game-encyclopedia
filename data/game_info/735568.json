Some of the assets; were sourced online for educational purposes. The project was to explore narrative design; the narrative design element was to explore branching narratives and use the foldback structure as the backbone of the narrative structure. <br/>The game is set in the year 2121, and the game starts with Alex going through a street before they are greeted by the bouncer at the Neon inn, where Chaze and Alasdair sit and wait for them. <br/>The premise of the game; is that Alex fought with their friends over a D &amp; D session, with all of the characters at death's door. Two years had passed before they got together to mourn for the death of a relative. Chaze is using this as an opportunity to get back at Alex for storming out of the D &amp; D session and never keeping in touch. Chaze has organized escape room puzzles where he and Alasdair take on the persona of the Gatekeeper (Alasdair) and The Jester (Chaze). <br/>Alex; is visiting his friends after two years; they moved out of town and became redundant at work and now have to go back home and live with their parents until they get back on their feet. Alex is feeling; nervous because they left in a fight with their two friends, Chaz and Alasdair; they walked out after a heated argument, and the only reason they are going to the pub is out of obligation to Chaze's relative. <br/>The First level is the prologue which holds the tutorial level and to setup Chaze and Alasdair before going through portals to level 2, which is Alasdair's bedroom, which is also present and dressed as the Gatekeeper, who the player will interact with him through a dialogue tree. The player will then have instructions to solve a riddle and will have the option to select one door out of two; one door out of the two will be the correct answer. The concept for the player choice is that the correct answer will have fun joke puzzles, whereas the wrong door will be time-based puzzles and more riddles with fewer and fewer hints each time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T06:23:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/823/82389e2336ee6bba0a24bce301865344.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mitch Mackay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
