They take turns finishing a dangerous track filled with foes, hoping to dominate the score table.<br/><br/>Your team is making the final preparations. The band are setting up to perform. And your ship - \u201dThe Blue Flamingo\u201d stands ready and waiting in the hangar...<br/><br/>The Blue Flamingo is a straight forward, bite size, Shoot em up game created entirely using handmade models. A 32 feet long handcrafted model was built specially for the game, along with countless props and assets that were filmed and photographed. All the effects, rocket flares and explosions were created using firecrackers and other pyrotechnics.<br/><br/>Like every other Shmup, this is a game that challenges you to reach the highest possible score. This is made interesting by an economical system that allows you to invest your score in upgrades, which makes earning more score points easier. On the other end, you are rewarded with interest on what is left of your score when you progress to the next level. You have to make a choice - to upgrade and try to regain the score, or rely on your skills to beat the increasingly difficult levels.<br/><br/>Use your greed wisely to beat your friends and climb up the score table.", "metacritic": 55, "released": "2014-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:34:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b399f22aed7c10a21964ce0ca417291.jpg", "website": "http://mightanddelight.com/the-blue-flamingo/", "rating": 2.05, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 32, "owned": 644, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Might and Delight"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Might and Delight"], "esrb_rating": null}
