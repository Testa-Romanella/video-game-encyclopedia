Gray squares hurt you instead, and green squares do double damage. - Since this is unfinished from what I originally wanted to do, it is most beneficial to line up Red squares since Red is tied to the enemy's Strength (Strength is the only stat that made it in)\u00a0and decreases it (all the colors will damage its HP, though).</p>\n<p>Find the 9 lost memories (they appear as puzzle pieces)\u00a0scattered around the world! Every certain number of steps the world will switch from the Bright Side to the Dark Side. You can replenish your supply of Recall Blocks by finding the floating Brains.</p>\n<p>I ran out of time for this.\u00a0I worked to the very last minute! I hope the game is still somewhat playable and beatable. I plan to update it greatly after the jam!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T12:11:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d07e2470d83850f4cfa24168a461d8f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpotOnJ2K"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
