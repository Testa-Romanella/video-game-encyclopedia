Most will just be interference from earth-based sources, such as radio towers. However, amongst them may (actually <strong>will</strong>) be a signal originating from the stars: a candidate for other intelligent life reaching out. If you believe you've found an extraterrestrial signal, tap the screen to store the signal.</p><p>Next you will print out the signal, to be faxed to experts. Before you send them the signal however, you will need to clean it up as much as possible. tap on the noise numbers (3, 5, 6, 7 and 9) to remove them from the sheet, leaving only the good signal values (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8). This isn't a points based game - you won't be penalised for not getting 100%, it's more for personal achievement.</p><p>Once the signal's printed, it'll be faxed to the experts and they'll let you know if you successfully found a signal originating from the stars.</p><p>The game is designed to be played with an android phone (or tablet if your forearms can take it), but there are PC builds that uses mouse clicks and the arrow (or awsd) keys to move around, but the experience won't be as engaging. It's also not been possible to test on Mac or Linux.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b5/7b5882934d29051220f184aa8844d05c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Skully B"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
