Thankfully, gamification, the process of adding game elements to tasks, has provided a solution to students' lack of motivation when learning basic mathematical operations. This project uses the medium of a video game to facilitate the understanding of basic operations. As the player goes through the different levels, they must find ways to achieve a desired number, rather than the more traditional mathematical inquiry of finding the answer to a specific operation. By looking for ways to overcome the level, they are asked to exercise their critical thinking skills and plan out a certain route, thus forming more of an impression while simultaneously furthering their understanding of the basic operations. Many levels allow a greater degree of freedom through multiple possible answers, thus encouraging creativity in problem solving. As the player follows young Zero\u2019s narrative, they encounter many different characters aiding them in their journey to confront Seven. From Zero To Hero: A Numbers Game is an effort to render entry into the domain of mathematics more approachable and enjoyable.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Disciplines Integrated: Psychology, Calculus, Studio Art\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T19:50:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f6/9f6abd1cb8d9320885141cf5ffe23dc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["champigni"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
