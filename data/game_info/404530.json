There are instructions to turn off sounds in the iPhone app under \"More\". The aim is to complete each round before the timer runs out, the further you get the faster the rounds become, so every second counts. Your score is how many rounds you get through.<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>==========<br/>At the beginning of the game you need to turn the digital crown away from you until the grey number matches the green one, then, a second later, a haptic/sound will confirm it if you haven\u2019t overshot. The green one is your goal and the arrows at the top of the screen indicate the direction as well. Then, on the next round, you need to turn the digital crown the other way until the two numbers match. Continue like that until the timer runs out and it\u2019s game over. The timer resets after every round!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T02:06:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/806/806feb588546849bc199c8c7deba5bcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Xenita"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Xenita"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
