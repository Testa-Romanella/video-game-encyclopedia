You were routinely flying your spaceship delivering gift packages until a giant octopus living atop a volcano decided to steal your spaceship, dispersing the precious cargo all over the hills. You equip yourself with a springy stilt in each hand to bounce through the challenging landscape to retrieve the lost gifts and eventually get back your stolen spaceship!<br/><br/><strong>Stilt</strong> is a colorful, stunning VR platformer game that takes inspiration from classic platformers. Use your quick reflexes and problem-solving skills to progress through the levels, collecting lost gift packages and stamps along the way. With your wits and stilts, you can handle any challenge: pass chasms, avoid traps, break things and smack creatures. Find power-ups to upgrade your stilts and become the ultimate stilt master!<br/><br/>Take part in several modes in various PvP arenas!
