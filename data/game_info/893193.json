You have to find your way out. The only way to get out is to find the 5 pages. Be careful, Slender Man doesn't like when people take his pages. Many have tried, none have succeeded. Will you be the first?</p>\n\n<p>I was taking part in a  \"Educational Programm\" and the final exercise was to make our own game. So I decided to pay my respects to my favorite childhood creepypasta. In the 7z document is the .exe file for the game and also a .JPEG image of the game's map.\u00a0 I apologize if the game doesn't have a high qualaty. (It's my first ever game and it was made in 3 days)</p>\n<p>ONLY USE THE MAP IF YOU ARE REALLY STRUGGLING BECAUSE IT WILL RUIN THE GAME.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T05:47:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acd/acd5ef593e7ff8302625d9fff3c413d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jahuds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
