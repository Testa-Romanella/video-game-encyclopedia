If your map doesn't appear in this list, make sure you \r\n    have saved your project in the map editor first, and then restart the client. \r\n    You'll need to choose a password as well. A password is requested to make sure you are the only who updates your map.\r\n    You shouldn't share this password with anyone.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    If everything works correctly, you should be able to \r\n    choose your own map the next time you go to the <em>Create Game</em> window.\r\n</p>\r\nHow to connect to a different Match Making Server\r\n<p>\r\n    By default, the client is configured to connect to a specifc match making server. However, the community \r\n    can host different match making servers, so the need to change this configuration arises. You can do so\r\n    by changing the <em>MatchMakingServerAddress</em> and <em>MatchMakinServerPort</em> parameters in the <em>client.ini</em> file.\r\n</p>\r\n(Advanced users) How to setup a Match Making Server\r\n<p>Check the GitHub repo for more information.</p>\r\nCredits\r\nSource Code\r\n<p>\r\n    The source code is available here.\r\n</p>\r\nSoftware libraries\r\n<ul>\n<li>OpenGL</li>\n<li>SDL2</li>\n<li>glad</li>\n<li>glm</li>\n<li>ImGui</li>\n<li>stb</li>\n<li>freetype</li>\n<li>enet</li>\n<li>openal-soft</li>\n<li>json</li>\n<li>zip</li>\n<li>argparse</li>\n<li>base64</li>\n<li>http-lib</li>\n<li>doctest</li>\n<li>result</li>\n</ul>\r\n Assets used \r\nSound\r\n<ul>\n<li>Music by Scott Buckley</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring Me The Sky (Victory Theme 01)</li>\n<li>Wayfarer (Victory Theme 02)</li>\n<li>Catalyst (Spawn Theme 01)</li>\n<li>Terminus (Spawn Theme 02)</li>\n<li>Goliath (Spawn Theme 03)</li>\n<li>Pathfinder (Spawn Theme 04)</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Sound effects by zapslat.com</li>\n<li>TTS Glados voice by 15.ai</li>\n</ul>\r\nTechniques / Tutorials used\r\n<ul>\n<li>Source Multiplayer Networking by Valve</li>\n<li>Client-Server Game Architecture by Gabriel Gambetta</li>\n<li>What Every Programmer Needs To Know About Game Networking by Glenn Fiedler</li>\n<li>Game Networking Resources</li>\n<li>LearnOpenGL by Joey de Vries</li>\n<li>How to create an explosion effect in Unity by Tvtig</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T08:58:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41e/41efd73b630d04c3711da082344d991b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Defu"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
