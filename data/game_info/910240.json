I hope the game isn't frustrating, but it's not too easy either, however given the short time for testing, it's hard to tell how difficult or easy the game currently is.</p><br/>Credits:<p>Programing and graphic by Hechelion.<br/><br/></p>Music License:<p>\ud83d\udd0a License: You\u2019re free to use this song in your videos, but you must include the following credits in your video's description (Copy &amp; Paste):<br/> \ud83d\udd3b \"Arthur Vyncke - A few jumps away\" is under a Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0) license. https://soundcloud.com/arthurvost <br/>\ud83c\udfb5 Music promoted by BreakingCopyright: https://bit.ly/a-few-jumps-song</p><br/>How to install<p>The game is programmed with Pygame.</p>\n<p>It can be played on the WEB thanks to pygbag and there is a portable version for windows thanks to Pyinstaller.</p>\n<p>The web version can be played directly on itch.</p>\n<p>The windows version, simply download the .zip, unzip and double click on \"interdimensional.exe\" (it does not require installing anything, it is a portable version)</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T09:04:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/661/661cd142e29a5776718d8eee99f351b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Hechelion"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
