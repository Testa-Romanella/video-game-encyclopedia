We're in pieces about the current situation, and are attempting to get in touch with Steam to clarify the issue. Until we get a response, Evergrow will likely be unavailable on Steam indefinitely. We'll get back to you all as soon as new information comes to light.</p><p>In the meantime, we're doubling down on efforts to have Evergrow available on other distribution platforms. The iOS version is currently awaiting approval, while a full version for itch.io is being prepared. While we have no fixed dates available yet, expect Evergrow to be available on several these platforms very soon. </p><p>We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has all caused and we promise to discuss the matter in further detail in the near future.
