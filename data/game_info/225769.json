The plotline is that people have been falling into a coma and waking up in a magical place called DreamCatcher HQ. There is only one way out and that's to compete in a tournament for a failsafe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hazel isn't interested in saving herself or competing with anyone. She ended up in a hospital ward under near constant supervision after becoming a risk to herself. The hospital she is in ends up being attacked by a monster named \"Head Heads\".</p>\n<p>\u00a0Can she survive when she already feels she has no reason to live?</p>\n<p>Hazel is a mentally ill transgender fairy. Her transgender status doesn't really come up at all in this game but it is worth noting that she is out and takes hormones.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e34/e34ac4bc5de0a8190da4cdc5315bf235.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pc0hidq"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
