Players can put whatever cubes they want to the scales. At the end of the each round, player with the most points on the scales wins 1 score. While moving on to the next round, all points on the scales are being deleted. So you have to use your cubes carefully. The first player to reach 5 scores wins the game. Currently game is offline, so you are playing against AI. With the next updates 1v1 online mode will be supported.</p>\n\n<p>W-A-S-D OR Arrow Keys To Move</p>\n<p>Mouse Button 1 For Click</p><p>Recommended Sensitivity: 0.60</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T06:44:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be0/be04982914650327657cde18c68efda7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Talha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
