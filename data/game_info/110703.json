{"id": 110703, "slug": "bloodlust", "name": "Bloodlust", "name_original": "Bloodlust", "description": "<p><strong>Bloodlust</strong></p>\n<p><em>A mysterious stranger arrives to a castle of vampires. What are the stranger's intentions? Will they help return the stolen items? Or will they bring with them terror unlike the castle has ever seen?</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Content warning: This game contains some slightly gruesome descriptions but is otherwise okay for general audiences.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This\u00a0\u00a0game was created as an entry in the Gothic Novel Jam. It involves puzzle elements and item collection. It features many different dialogue options, including 4 different endings. See how many you can find! Please forgive my\u00a0limited art skills.</p>\n<p>While the game has no music, I suggest listening to the Calm Piano playlist by Sophie Mccart. It's not especially spoopy, but adds a nice castle-y vibe I think.</p>\n<p>As always, thank you to Adam for the bitsy engine, ayolland for the borksy tool, and mildmojo and Sean for various hacks.</p>\n<p>Note: I have checked the game over thoroughly, but due to the fact that I am not a programmer and this is the biggest coding endeavor I have ever undertaken,\u00a0there may be some bugs. Please notify me if you believe something to not be working correctly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd9/fd9e18729b035ac935f5b9b50320d843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pi_Ninja"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
