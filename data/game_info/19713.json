With so many people in a city, there is always the need for new living space, which has to be opened up with roads. In addition, the residents ask here and there for wider and faster roads. Under certain circumstances you get contracts for plaster work, the creation of pedestrian and bike paths, or the replacement of gas, water and power lines in existing roads.<br/><br/>For a realistic representation, a 3D graphics engine is used, which represents the events at any time clearly and realistically. Step by step the player gains experience and thus more extensive special orders. A level is considered to be solved, if within the specified time, the given tasks have been fulfilled. But be careful, unpredictable events always affect the current happenings, such as:<br/><br/><ul><li>Preferable emergency orders, such as conduction breaks<br/></li><li>Weather conditions such as wind, ice and rain<br/></li><li>Unpredictable obstacles &amp; Technical defects</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c03/c03541d4722904265a4e35715c7becea.jpg", "website": "http://uieg.de/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["United Independent Entertainment"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["United Independent Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
