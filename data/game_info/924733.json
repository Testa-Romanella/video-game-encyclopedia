The mutant lice pandemic affects all adults regardless of scalp conditions.  With the implementation of project A.L.I.C.E, (Anti-Lice Infestation Control Exterminator) scientists have manufactured an AI nanorobot to exterminate the pests slowly burrowing into your brain.<br/></p>\n<p>You play as A.L.I.C.E, using W, A, S, D and the Mouse to control the character. The 1, 2 and 3 number keys will swap between your fists, gun and axe. Around the patient's scalp are zones of eggs and lice crawling around. The lice will either attempt to burrow into the patient's brain or begin sucking blood from their scalp. As an Anti-Lice Infestation Control Exterminator, you must navigate around the patient's scalp and exterminate lice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>LIQUID DAMAGE TEAM:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Aaron Kane - 3D &amp; Texturing\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Eamonn Bailey - Sound Design\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>James Rooney Barker - 3D &amp; Animation\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Marcos Ventura - UI &amp; Design\r\n</p>\n<p>Megan Saenz - VO &amp; Narrative\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Natalia Di Simone - UI Implementation</p>\n<p>Samuel Martins - Composer &amp; Sound Design\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Tomasz Galka - Lead Programmer\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T17:12:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbd6eccbcff40f80b586cc5770683f74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SimoniNR"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
