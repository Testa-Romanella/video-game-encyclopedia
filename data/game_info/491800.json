I wanted to make something simple that would help me relax and take my mind off things and hopefully put me in a better state of mind. A few nights ago I was having trouble sleeping and I remembered this game. I played it a bit and it helped me calm down. The next day I decided that I would finish the game and share it with the public. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThese are pretty stressful and uncertain times, but I hope this game is as helpful for you as it is to me and is a comforting experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI'd love to hear what you think of the game. And if you want to say hi feel free to reach out on Twitter @SodaDrinkerPro.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWill<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNote: this game is not a substitute for seeing a doctor or therapist.
