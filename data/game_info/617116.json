But i dare you.....never disturb this bliss of mine.\u201c</p>\n<p>The deceased rockstar Spocky was just trying to relax in the afterlife, laying in his deep, hollow grave, slowly decomposing in a forgotten crypt. Until his eternal sleep is rudely interrupted by noisy graverobbers, wanting to earn their fortune by stealing, what is not rightfully theirs. It's time for Spocky to put on his leather jacket, nail his sunglasses to the side of his skulls and grab his beauty of a gun.\u00a0Cause he has got to pick a bone with someone..... Cryptslinger is an isometric shoot them up, where your weapon of choice is a gun which can be modified on the fly, in order to choose the right damage type for each enemy encountered. Be sure to use them accordingly or else the graverobbers will withstand your bullets like sponges.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>w, a, s, d - Movement</p>\n<p>Shift - Dash</p>\n<p>Space - Switch attachment slot (White box at the bottom of the screen)</p>\n<p>Scroll wheel up/down - Switch attachment</p>\n<p>Left mouse button - Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:14:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04c/04c976b7daedd7cdfa6c149d38f7ba72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itsPhil"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
