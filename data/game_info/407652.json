As a kid, you inexplicably gained the ability to talk to common grocery items. Now you use that power to solve crimes nobody else is equipped for.</p>\n<p>It was a day like any other, until you were called up. Someone had stolen a Sandwich just before lunch - only you can solve the case. Interrogate the leftovers, and if they don't cooperate make them talk. Food does not have rights.</p>\n<p>Created by Alex Williams (https://byrabbit.itch.io/) and Dennis Lorenz (@OtherDennis) for the Shenanijam 2018 (https://itch.io/jam/bscotch2018).\u00a0</p>\n<p>After long debates over suitable game concepts, we got inspired by both the Void Sandwich and the Sticky Justice theme, and ended up with a Cop interrogating an Office Fridge.
