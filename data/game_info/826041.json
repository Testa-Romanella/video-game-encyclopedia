Maybe I will refactor the game after the jam.</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow Keys to Move the ball, destroy colored blocks that have the same color as the ball</p>\n<p>Inside Level Editor: Left Click to place a tile, Right Click to select it (get color, change color), Play button to play test the level, Save button to save the level data to your clipboard, load to import level data from your clipboard (share your levels with your friends!)</p>\n\n<p>Inside Main Menu: Classic Level to play 25 of the classic levels.
