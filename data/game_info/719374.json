My choice was a 2d game that was built around the idea of attacking enemies that came from the top of the screen, super simple, but with the extra challenge of only being allowed to miss a certain amount of times before you lose. By the end I had a bunch of squares on the screen of different colors, each representing a different entity, whether it be a red enemy or the white-square player, and the only non-square thing was a wrench made in MS Paint. It was a super fun experience, and I\u00a0decided to flesh it out and release it as some fun game you would probably play for 3-5 minutes. Thank you for playing this little passion project of mine and enjoy!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T08:32:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62a/62a7fcccefbb0b570fc72022c6bdbb2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Waghally"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
