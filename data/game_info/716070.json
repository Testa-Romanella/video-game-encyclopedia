Your house is in a valley next to some hills and mountains. Of course, you can\u2019t wait to go sledding but to get a thrill, you decide doing it blindfolded.\u00a0Soon you discover, that this was not the best idea, you can\u2019t see anything and there are lots of trees on the hill.\u00a0You have to be careful, not hitting these trees but luckily you can hear how the wind whistles through the trees. You navigate your sled down the hill and pass the trees safely by moving towards the wind finding the passages.\u00a0Your sled is rather robust, but still\u00a0it can only take three hits before your adventure ends.</p>\r\n\u2744\ufe0f About the game\r\n<p>This game was developed as part of the Games for Blind Gamers Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Furthermore it was developed almost entirely live on stream on my Twitch channel:\u00a0https://twitch.tv/vojay</p>\n<p>If you would like to know more about the development process I am happy to welcome you in my stream.</p>\n<p>The game itself can be played completely blind. It has a visualization but that gives you no advantages. I tried to also cover color blindness and different levels of blindness by using specific colors and\u00a0distinctive effects like the full screen flashing on success or failure. Still, all this is not relevant for playing the game and it is enjoyed best with your eyes closed.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the ride!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T05:13:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e01c966c604a4ab2ee7268746f72a2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vojay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
