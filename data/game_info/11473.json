Stay alert and quiet to avoid attracting them, and be prepared to either run or fight for your life at a moment\u2019s notice.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCRAFT - Gathering raw materials is a key part of crafting. Axes, pickaxes, and crowbars allow you to harvest the various trees, rocks, and vehicles scattered around the world. You should collect what you can, when you\u2019re not actively fending off threats.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTAKE BACK CONTROL - The first step in re-establishing society is to solidify a foothold in the struggle against the undead, and you can help by claiming a Stronghold in Badwater Canyon. Each location has unique advantages, so it\u2019s wise to scout before making a commitment.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCOORDINATE - Those that want to travel safely, access contested locations, and successfully defend their Strongholds will want to work together with other players. Note that Badwater Canyon is a desperate place, and your neighbors may find that they\u2019re better off just taking what they need from your dead body. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDo you have what it takes to Just Survive?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVisit the Just Survive website https://www.justsurvive.com to learn more about this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:08:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff2/ff244a89bde8395c8d3664df8dbbd332.jpg", "website": "https://www.h1z1.com/just-survive", "rating": 2.43, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 754, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 67}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 94, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 95, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daybreak Games Company"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Daybreak Game Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
