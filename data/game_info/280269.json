Or you could just chill out, relax and enjoy the time cycle, watching sunsets and sunrises while listening to a quite contagious music.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Simple controls:</strong></p>\n<p><em>WASD</em> to move</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p><em>W</em> to move forward and <em>MOUSE</em> to control direction</p>\n<p>Front tires will dictate most of the direction in which the car is going to move forward. But be careful, this little car can get really crazy sometimes, maybe you will get some surprises along the way.</p>\n\n\n<p>From the creator of Batman in the Long Night, comes yet another mini\u00a0short game. This is an end-of-term assignment in which we had to create a car game with a specific theme, be able to make a Day/Night cycle with street lights going on and off and some more other stuff for the environment\u00a0as stretch goals. All made in Unreal Engine 4.</p>\n<p>For me, I initially\u00a0got inspired by this MINI commercial (Apart that, when I knew I had to model a car, I couldn't help myself modeling my favorite car)\u00a0and wanted to recreate that experience of risking it all in a rally. But as you can see, I gave it kind of my own twist to make it a little fun casual game, with stylized visuals/textures\u00a0inspired by games like <em>Fortnite</em>. Worked on it for 3 weeks.\u00a0And, I don't know, maybe I could update it with some challenging obstacles, but for now is pretty fun trying to handle this little crazy car while listening to a quite uplifting song.</p>\n<p><em>if you try it out, don't forget to leave some feedback, everything is useful.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>\n<p>Then again, I'm open to work in little fun games or help anyone in a game jam, feel free to contact me and we will see how to make it work!</p>\n<p>ArtStation</p>\n<p>LinkedIn</p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS TO</strong></p>\n<ul><li>All my classmates, professors and teacher assistants for their constant support and silly ideas that inspire me to get creative everyday.</li><li>My loved ones, who continue to inspire\u00a0me everyday to make awesome games for them, too.</li><li>Everyone that gets to try this game out, thank you for taking some time of your day with me.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17e/17e955e3d389ce8595d6c2b7d032594a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diana Ulloa"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
