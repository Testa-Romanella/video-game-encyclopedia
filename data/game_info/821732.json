Each time you attempt a level you will be rerolled. The higher your roll the heavier you are, but also the heartier. Try to reach the top of each level (The casino doors are hard to miss) to win, and along the way you might want to grab a playing card or two. And beware the other dice falling around you! Sure, getting tapped by a one might not be that bad, but nobody wants to get crushed by a six.<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun, and happy rolling!</p>\n<p>(For the webGL version, go into fullscreen)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T10:50:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aef/aef0b5b69425d69c10ebf8ff8162d5e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["FireFly_01"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
