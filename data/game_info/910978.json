That means he has a lot to do, until the game is finally clean. To make his work durable, he likes to listen to his own songs. The game itself is a rythm based platformer. DelTA can jump, dash, kick and instadrop. Those actions are reflected in musical themes in each level. The ground and obstacles are assets of very different styles.<br/><br/>Game has been tested on macOS ver 10.13.6<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T14:32:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b63/b63242fecaed00c124f9a1ab369af27b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christian Barbu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
