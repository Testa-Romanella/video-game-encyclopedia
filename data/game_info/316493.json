I didn't even realize it ran at all until recently. An artifact from my past, I built this on cracked pre-5.0 unity pro and just shoved as much effects in as I could before I ever learned how to uh, not do that. The *entire landmass* is a water shader. It's beautiful though! It will only run on a fairly powerful computer (I can't play it on my own laptop) so apologies in advance if it doesn't run for you!</p>\n<p>I also did not record which videos and audio I pulled off of YouTube, because of course I didn't (I have learnt better since).<br/><br/>There's a video walk-through if you still want to explore and are on mac or it won't run for you! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:47:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/babeb9dbd4b59f5c9bc43c774bd5fcc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hope Erin Phillips"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
