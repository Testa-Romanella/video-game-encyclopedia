Can she hold off the massive pileup of snow long enough to let through the children, or will they be lost to the frost?</p>\n<p>It's sort of like Pac-Man, but less interesting. If there's too much snow on the streets, the children will be lost to the snow, so your job is to keep the streets as clear as possible. Try to focus on where the kids are walking to save as many of them as possible. They'll be able to manage some snow, but if they try to walk through too much, they won't be able to handle it.\u00a0If you crash into another vehicle, a new plow will be ready for you immediately. A perfect score is difficult, but not impossible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:27:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff120f3103ba5e246b2633f46f7fd193.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DavidA3D"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
