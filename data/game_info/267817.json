There was once a young knight.\r\nHe was madly in love with a princess. But she wouldn\u2019t notice him.\r\nOnly a Minnesang, the combination of all four high arts, could convince her. Not giving up on his love, he ventured out to the famous castle of arts, Tonilot.\r\nMinnesang is a humorous single player action-adventure-platformer, in which you have to wander the corridors of the castle and fulfill the quests of the Masters of Dance, Fine Arts, Music and Poetry to learn all the arts. Only he who has mastered all the high arts can perform the ultimate Minnesang and obtain true love! <br/></p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>Minnesang was designed and created in 3 weeks by all of the students of the 2017 class at the Zurich University of the Arts. The supporting lecturers were Ulrich G\u00f6tz and Beat Suter. The task of the course was to create a game which oriented itself on the spatial dimensions and features of the Toni-Areal in Zurich. <br/></p>\r\nTeam\r\nProject Managment\r\n<ul><li>Sebastian Riedi</li></ul>\r\nStory &amp; Idea\r\n<ul><li>Pierre Lippuner                    </li></ul>\r\nWriting &amp; Story\r\n<ul><li>Pierre Lippuner </li><li>Eileen R\u00fcegg\u00a0 </li><li>Enya Gerber </li><li>Fabian Hunziker </li><li>Nathalie Meier </li><li>Shamika Biswas </li></ul>\r\nGame Mechanics\r\n<ul><li>Pascal Felber </li><li>Jan Schneider </li><li>Roman von Rotz </li><li>Ruedy Stacher </li><li>\u00a0Shamika Biswas</li></ul>\r\nTechnical Development \r\n<ul><li>Jan Schneider </li><li>Roman von Rotz </li><li>Pascal Felber </li><li>Pierre Lippuner</li></ul>\r\nArt Direction\r\n<ul><li>Denise Hohl</li></ul>\r\nCharacterdesign\r\n<ul><li>Yves Biber </li><li>Luciano Mock </li><li>\u00a0Teodora Dimova</li></ul>\r\nRoomdesign\r\n<ul><li>Ruedy Stacher </li><li>\u00a0Denise Hohl </li><li>Eileen R\u00fcegg </li><li>Enya Gerber </li><li>Joel Schwendimann</li><li>\u00a0Nathalie Meier</li></ul>\r\nSound/Music\r\n<ul><li>Hanh-Dung Nguyen</li><li>\u00a0Andreas Strahm</li><li>\u00a0Fabian Hunziker</li><li>\u00a0Shamika Biswas</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bc/1bc1c1ae4cabe1896970652a8806bc33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sriedi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
