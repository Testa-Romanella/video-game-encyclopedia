The player controls a rather primitive single-celled creature, so we chose a light and funny way of moving - the player can only jump and move his body, or try to make it roll to move forward.\r\n  </p>\n<p>In order to win the ultimate survival advantage, players need to constantly absorb new gene fragments and grow themselves to gain an advantage over other creatures. Gene fragments can be picked up from the map or taken directly from other creatures.\r\n  </p>\n<p>There are four types of gene fragments in the game that affect the player's weight, hardness, structural strength and mobility. These four types of gene fragments are represented by cubes, cones, cylinders and spheres.\r\n  </p>\n<p>It is up to the player to decide where to place the absorbed genetic fragments and what evolutionary path to take, resulting in an infinite variety of evolutionary outcomes.\r\n  </p>\n<p>For example, a spike-covered attacker can break through an opponent's defenses with his own hardness, a big, heavy man can crush his target with his weight, and a light-weight jumper can take advantage of other creatures' weaknesses with a clever maneuver.\r\n  </p>\n<p>In addition to the choice of evolutionary strategy, the balance between the attributes is equally important, if the player is obsessed with defense, he may end up being slaughtered because his weight is spread out in place, and being covered in sharp weapons can help you attack everything, but you may be torn apart in the fight with the enemy because of the lack of stickiness.\r\n  </p>\n<p>We hope to tell this dusty epic of the beginning of life through a light-hearted and humorous game. And how do the players win among the winners and losers? It's all up to you to write.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Look\u2014Mouse</li><li>Move\u2014WASD\u00a0</li><li>Jump\u2014SPACE</li><li>Absorb\u2014TAB</li><li>Rotate\uff08Absorb\uff09\u2014Right Mouse Button</li><li>Decide\uff08Absorb\uff09\u2014Left Mouse Button</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T08:10:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d59/d597b67e885856afef23e752f6c55920.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gattler6"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
