Will you call your serfs from the fields or spend your coin building a standing army? Do you become a bannerman for another noble or start your own coalition to back up your claim? You will need a strong economy, a strong army, and loyal allies to take the crown.<br/><br/><strong>Create</strong>\u00a0your\u00a0<strong>unique coat of arms</strong>\u00a0and build your\u00a0<strong>family dynasty</strong>\u00a0by winning traits and titles over multiple game sessions. Feudums has multiple ways to win and features a one-of-a-kind\u00a0<strong>vassalage</strong>\u00a0system. Each session is a\u00a0<strong>community-driven narrative</strong>\u00a0which will flow differently than previous games.<br/><br/>Both sword and mind need to be tempered to walk the path that leads to the crown. Do you have what it takes?\u00a0<strong>Is it your destiny to sit on the throne</strong>?<br/><br/>Heavily influenced by old-school strategy games like Lords of the Realm, Defender of the Crown or Genesia, early CRPG MUSHes, Crusader Kings and classic board games, Feudums is part\u00a0<strong>builder</strong>, part\u00a0<strong>strategy</strong>, completely\u00a0<strong>moddable</strong>\u00a0and is\u00a0<strong>fully built around its players</strong>, with carefully crafted,\u00a0<strong>hand-drawn</strong>\u00a0visual style, contextual music tracks and original melodies.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>~~~</strong></p>\n<p>Welcome to the playable demo of Feudums, a game <strong>currently in development</strong>.\u00a0Our demos are always updated as new milestone builds are completed or we have quality of life (QoL) improvements to add. We always invite the community to play our game and give us any feedback you have afterwards. We love to hear from our players!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just remember, we are PRE-early access: <strong>much of the game is not yet available as we continue to plug away on development</strong>. This is more like a minimum viable product so you can have a first impression and tell us whether we're on the right track. While we do our best to ship stable previews, don\u2019t be surprised if you find a few bugs. If you are unlucky enough to find one, please make sure to report it so we can fix it for our next update!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>If pre-beta games are not your cup of tea, that is completely fine. Please bear with us until we ship a more or less feature-complete public beta.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T06:06:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/110/1105ada66e92df6140bea9042e051a72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kalamona Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
