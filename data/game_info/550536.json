Autonomous research ships are sent into space, all equipped with an Explorer robot, called CORG-E.

A spaceship comes into view. On its hull, the letters M.A.M. are visible. With a loud BANG, a small pod is shot from the belly of the ship. It races towards the planet and disappears into its atmosphere. On the planet\u2019s surface, a few alien creatures seem to live together in a village. Suddenly a loud BOOM shakes the village and its residents. Not far from the village, the pod has crashed into the field. As the pod opens, a small robot drives out of a hatch on its tracks. An antenna extends from its back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:08:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d93ef921977ae96fb0f5b81d6d3e271d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["bitbrain", "Laslo Jott", "modelay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
