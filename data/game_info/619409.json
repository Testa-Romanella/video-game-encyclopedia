It would have been interesting to explore rail limited movement as well if I\u00a0had more time.\u00a0Might want to explore the idea again later if there's interest!<br/><br/>The amazing tileset comes from Kenney.nl with minor modifications from me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:35:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5a/d5a28e9d0ced55ef2dcdfdff49703dc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["poka"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
