This Game is still in Development and is subject to major design changes and I\u00a0\u00a0still need a name for it, so let me know if you have suggestions.</p>\r\nGame Basics\r\n\r\n<p>This is a top-down shooter where you play as a tank that will fight against enemy tanks as well as gunners to push into the enemy camp to destroy it. There will be a fixed path that you fallow fighting groups of enemies that advance from their camp. I hope to have around 30 - 50 Different levels.\r\n</p>\r\nGame Mechanics\r\n\r\nTurrets\r\n<p>There will be various types of turrets(top section of a tank) you can install of your tank including a rocket launcher, a machine gun and more.\r\n</p>\r\nUpgrading\r\n<p>After each level, you will be able to return to your camp and upgrade your weapons and armor. In order to upgrade something, you need to have enough bolts, which are dropped from tanks you destroy in combat.\r\n</p>\r\nDeath/Respawn\r\n<p>When you die you drop all the bolts you have collected during that level but can get them back\u00a0 if you push back to the point you died and collect them. You will respawn back at your camp after death and continue playing the level, but if the enemy manage to push back into your camp and destroy it, you will lose that level.</p>\r\nEnemies\u00a0\r\n<p>So far, there will be 2 different types of enemy tanks like you than will move around and gunners which are positioned in towers you need to destroy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T09:15:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2b/a2ba6246f4a9bbddeb54d3a3ed4e6cc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fredy32"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
