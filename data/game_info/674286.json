This course empowers learners to apply knowledge and practice selecting the appropriate PPE and properly donning and doffing it in a virtual museum. It concludes with a final exam in a virtual laboratory.<h3>OBJECTIVES:</h3>After completing this course, learners will be able to:<br/>\u2022\tIdentify the routes of transmission of infectious agents.<br/>\u2022\tDemonstrate how to don and doff the appropriate PPE for daily use at the bench<br/>\u2022\tDemonstrate how to don and doff PPE during an emergency.<h3>AUDIENCE:</h3>This course is designed for clinical and public health laboratory professionals, including safety professionals and persons who work with potentially infectious agents in a laboratory.<h3>VR NOTE:</h3>This course is designed to work ONLY on the HTC Vive VR platform.  A play area of at least 3 ft. x 3 ft. is recommended, but a larger 20 ft. x 20 ft. space would be ideal, to make the learning experience in this VR courses feel more authentic and real.  This VR course also requires a play area with 360\u00b0 tracking.
