The game is still early in development with known issues such as framerate hitches, missing sound effects, and a low density of content. Feedback is appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay tips for things without in-game tutorials</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>You can reset to your most recent checkpoint by holding [Select/Option/Whatever it's called] on controller, or [X] on a QWERTY keyboard (it's based on the key's position, not the letter). <br/>You keep all items on reset or death, it just teleports you back and heals you.\u00a0 Very useful if you fell and lost progress!</li><li>You can sleep to pass the night. Crouch on a bed or hold crouch without moving for several seconds to sit, then hold crouch again to sleep. You'll sleep 2 hours at a time during the day, and sleep until morning at night.<br/>Sleeping on the ground doesn't heal you or create a new checkpoint, so watch out if you were trying to sleep right before a tricky climb!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Where to follow development:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Leave feedback or ask for help on the discord server: https://discord.gg/NGhZRCEQG3</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The game's development is streamed live on twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/needleful</li><li>Devlogs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjnRnpGPUaKWlSVuyBFF8C72pOVpQQ5xT</li><li>All development VODs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjnRnpGPUaKVg931uVE2F9QSOBAAzLF14<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T12:49:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56a/56a3921c07c112e8f226bcd7daa32c57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["needleful"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
