Nothing will stop these plates from being put away with all these crumbs on them!\u00a0</strong></p>\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>Not what you would want to see in your cupboard!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move the green bubble (Mouse movement) around the screen to <strong>avoid any dirty dishes</strong> while ensuring no dishes are left untouched by the bubbles surrounding you. Everytime a blue bubble cleans a dish you lose 1 Soap Power, but an uncleaned dish that escapes you will cost you 10.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use the soap dispenser by<strong> hovering over the pump</strong> to start generating soap power, after the animation ends you'll<strong> get a bit of power back</strong> - so make sure to always keep it running!</p>\n\n<p>One of the many assets I didn't get to use</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>First and foremost, Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my game! I'll be honest I had some difficulty thinking of what kind of game I wanted to make. Although the theme + limitation meshed together really well, it took me the entire first day and a lot of unused assets to finally settle on a dish washing Tower Defense kind of game. Obviously that didn't happen mainly because I felt just having towers felt a bit flat,\u00a0\u00a0after adding a player character / Magic Fairy Bubble\u2122\u00a0I decided to entirely forgo the tower defense part and have just the bubble swarm. I hope I got the limitation correctly, my thinking was that 'The Swarm' is the player and you use pieces of yourself as ammo to fight the plates?\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T03:38:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/168d1524536a26ef1528b229da8d1acc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["SeaEgull"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
