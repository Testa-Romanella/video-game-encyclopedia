There are quite a number of different endings so be sure to try it all. On a side note, I originally planned for this story to be consisting of pixel art and so I might add some of that later too.</p>\n<p>I feel like I could expand on the characters a little more but that was taking the narrative away from the point, I was hoping to keep the festive spirit - which I think I could expand a bit more.<br/></p>\n<p>If this one is well liked then I would make a horror game next.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T03:02:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c42911693433f068141b82e2ff4585a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["**LiT\u20ac\u00ae@T\u00a3**"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
