{"id": 387811, "slug": "ich-will-project", "name": "Ich Will Project", "name_original": "Ich Will Project", "description": "<p>Your childhood friend Eileen entrusted you a secret: How to enter people's psyche. The next moment she disappeared in front of your eyes. Now no-one around you is able to remember she ever existed... or do they? With very little knowledge about what's happening, and in the hope of rescuing her you try to follow her instructions and gather pieces inside the mind of key people close to her. Will you be able to bring back Eileen? Or you will end just like her?<br/></p>\n<p>Ich Will Project is a relatively basic visual novel, that puts you in a situations of trust and internalized psychological problems in order to ultimately solve the mystery of the disappearance of your friend, while at the same time making a difference in the life of the people involved, hopefully for good.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>So this is a game I'm developing and found out recently that I can request it to be posted in the game category, specially now that I released the demo recently. However, I'm not exactly sure if that counts as being released or not. Whatever the case is, I will leave this here for the time being.<br/><br/>I've been working on this game for a few months, and even though the game is complete, it sadly lacks art. Just recently I thought about using Koikatsu assets to provide placeholder visuals, so how it looks now is, hopefully, not a finalized version of the game. Since I started recently, I'm still implementing visuals, but while I was doing so I got some ideas for the game so I ended changing some parts of the script, one of them being directly how the game starts, so right now I don't have a working build, except for really old builds I don't want to share. I do have plans to release a demo in this very week if possible, containing half of the 3 main routes for the game, but possibly without the art, yet.<br/><br/>The reason I'm doing the thread right now is to work as a dev blog of sorts. As I work with the script and keep making the placeholders while I also look for an actual artist to provide art for the game.\u00a0<br/><br/>Additional information:</p>\n<ul><li>3 Main routes with 3 unlockable routes.\r\n</li><li>Each route is made by 8 parts, not counting the intro with 1 part for each girl.\r\n</li><li>Each route will have choices and 3 different endings, not counting the \"general\" bad ending.\r\n</li><li>Each part will have at least 1 CG with multiple variants\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>The main idea behind the game is variations and subconscious. Each psyche you will travel to will reveal you a vastly different reality, from a military castle, to a futuristic city and a deserted island.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'm open to criticism, suggestions and the such. To give you an idea of the elements of the game, the game mainly draws inspiration from\u00a0Hoshizora no Memoria,\u00a0Yume Miru Kusuri\u00a0and\u00a0Imouto Paradise, for the story, themes and the structure of choices in that order, among other things. It will not be completely smut, it will be mostly story heavy, but it will have a lot of sexual content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:16:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/050/05050bd1e777c954a309e3780b761ab7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Amazoness Enterprises"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
