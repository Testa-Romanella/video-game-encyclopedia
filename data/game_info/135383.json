Your goal is to knock your opponent to Zero health by matching blocks to Attack, Block, and Build super. There are a planned set of characters that will all feature unique stats and a special ability.</p><p>This is an early prototype and all planned features are not in the game right now, nor are alternative characters. I plan to develop this over the course of months to flesh out both of those things. Also get good art.</p><p>Currently only features a Vs. AI mode and a tutorial</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef8b49d27b235d74905d5cf8c03f0113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hot Off the Stack Games"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
