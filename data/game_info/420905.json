It's an early stage of prototyping the game and may be full of bugs and unoptimized.</p>\n<p>I'm still learning how to develop a game but with the help of Shaun Spalding's tutorials series to make a Platformer game, I've been able to make a solid structure to make my game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is his awesome Youtube channel :\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/user/999Greyfox</p>\n<p>Now I'm trying to complete the development of the game all by myself. I do some crappyxel arts but sometimes I use free graphic content (listed below).</p>\n<p>You can follow my progress on Twitter :\u00a0https://twitter.com/Ghomerr</p>\n<p>Feel free to try the game by downloading the latest snapshot here.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The game is about a little mage which needs to retrieve magical hats lost in a magical world filled with monsters and deadly traps. After finding a magical hat, he can use its magic to explore the world, solve little puzzles and protect himself from hostile environments.<br/></p>\n<p>The temporary name for this game is \"Little Mage Adventure\" but it should end being called \"Magic Hat'venture\".</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move left :\u00a0A\u00a0or\u00a0Q\u00a0or gamepad left pad</li><li>Move right :\u00a0D\u00a0or gamepad left pad</li><li>Jump :\u00a0space\u00a0or gamepad\u00a0A\u00a0or\u00a0X\u00a0button</li><li>Aiming : mouse or gamepad right pad</li><li>Shoot : left mouse button or gamepad right trigger</li><li>Action : right mouse button or gamepad\u00a0B\u00a0or\u00a0O\u00a0button</li><li>Hats wheel :\u00a0shift\u00a0or gamepad left trigger</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Other artists resources used in the game</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Forest Tileset for menu, levels 1 &amp; 2 :\u00a0https://rottingpixels.itch.io/nature-platformer-tileset\u00a0(with small changes)</li><li>Parallax for menu, levels 1 &amp; 2 :\u00a0https://mamanezakon.itch.io/forest-tileset</li><li>Forest Tileset for level 3 :\u00a0https://mamanezakon.itch.io/forest-tileset\u00a0(with small changes)</li><li>Parallax for level 3 :\u00a0https://aethrall.itch.io/demon-woods-parallax-background</li></ul>\n<p><strong>GitHub project</strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/Ghomerr/little_mage</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T05:54:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64b/64b1a2835c37eba1ef4e17c5343fc5a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghomerr"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
