Each level consists of colorful fish swimming inside a wooden barrel. The player will use their mouse to aim and left click the mouse button to shoot. When a fish is destroyed, it drops coins that can be collected to add time to the next level. A level is complete when all the fish in the barrel are destroyed within the time limit. As the player progresses, each level becomes more difficult with faster, smaller fish.\u00a0 There are 3 boss levels and even an epic boss battle on the final level. This is my first attempt at building a game, so any and all comments are encouraged.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T06:53:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75e/75ee176f91559be9482147588bd2d398.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OddZod"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
