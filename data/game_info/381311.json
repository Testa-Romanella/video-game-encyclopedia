A perfect game for achievers and explorers alike.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use your skills and reflexes to survive. The deeper you get, the more chances that you\u2019ll fight battle-tainted creatures through music. Avoid their intricate traps, all to solve an ancient history of magic and restore your former glory.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Histericum Solaria can be played through a browser, Windows and MacOS. However, it is still under development (<strong>Prototype Phase)</strong> and currently, I am still working with its Twine version. A simple gameplay without any rhythm vs battles, complex world traveling, etc.</p>\n<p>Please note that the game is still incomplete and looks unpolished. By making a\u00a0demo available soon, I\u2019m hoping to hear some feedback and suggestions to improve a specific feature or the game itself.</p>\n\n<p>I am Quaser Novus who is currently doing every detail in the game such as SFX, Artwork, Storytelling, etc. Also, the image/s (Character Icons)\u00a0I used as placeholders belongs\u00a0to their rightful owners. In due time, I\u2019ll update these and put mine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0would like to say this in advance so that I may not disappoint you\u2014 The fate of this project is still unknown but I'll keep on putting constant updates.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cGo onwards, Young spirit!\u201d\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b5/7b50716cb7b6890b3f7366093b1b1f03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["QuaserNovus"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
