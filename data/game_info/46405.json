Let the moody jazz soundtrack carry you through a thought provoking &amp; ruthless story of love, deceit, murder, companionship and war. Meant to be a fresh take on the classic strategy RPG style, Arcadian Atlas was designed from the ground up to incorporate more challenging battle strategies, new &amp; balanced job classes, and more cutthroat plot twists that'll leave these complex characters' lives hanging in the balance.<br/><br/>Featuring dynamic job classes, a rich character driven narrative, strategic grid-based battles and a jazz infused soundtrack, Arcadian Atlas is a lushly handcrafted 2D isometric tactical RPG that takes the rich history of the genre and makes it fresh.Gameplay<br/>The core philosophy behind Arcadian Atlas is simple: Challenging strategic battles with unique classes that make every fight a different experience. That means terrain that affects your movement, cover that can hinder the best laid plans, and skills that are never wasted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Investment matters, and in a tactical RPG your biggest investment is your character class. So we want them to be purposeful, which is why classes in Arcadian Atlas have several core builds that your characters develop over the course of the game. That means no class hopping, but instead class evolution.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Customize your character at the start with their preferred class build, and when the time comes you can specialize that build through branching evolved classes with entire skill trees all their own.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Ranger</strong> - the master of area control, a Ranger\u2019s projectile attacks and crowd control skills revolve around traversal and using terrain to their advantage.<br/><br/><strong>Apothecary</strong> - a chemist of extraordinary skill, the Apothecary\u2019s potent brews and experimental arts can heal or wreck devastating damage on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Rogue</strong> - sneaky, sneaky; stabby, stabby. The Rogue isn\u2019t interested in manners - why bother when slashing an achilles heel or a surprise attack does the job faster?<br/><br/><strong>Warmancer</strong> - adept at brute force and powerful magics, the warmancer specializes in harnessing latent energies for devastating area of affect spells.<br/><br/><br/>And that's just the beginning! Outside those and other core classes, we also have two Advanced Classes for each Base class! At a certain job level, you'll open up two advanced classes to choose from that further specialize your troops!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Start by molding each of your characters with your preferred stats to make that rogue a tiny bit stronger so backstab damage finishes foes off in one swoop, or quicker to get in and out of a conflict in a pinch.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And skills, our favorite part of any tactical RPG. Nothing wasted, everything with a purpose: that's our skill philosophy, so our skill system consists of branching specializations for each class.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Start out with your choice of weapon mastery skills which dictate how you want that class to play. Want your Ranger to master the wider range and faster movement skills of a bow, or the sheer power and crippling attacks from a crossbow? Choose based on your style and watch as new branches open with more powerful and unique abilities to compliment that style.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Arcadia is a sprawling continent divided by immense mountains, with landscapes as varied as the inhabitants. We\u2019re looking forward to bringing those ecosystems into the battle system by creating a breathtaking pixel world that is as treacherous as it is gorgeous.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thick snowfall, dense forests, rushing rivers, tiered cities - every map affects the way you approach a fight and alters your strategy. Make use of trees to protect yourself from that line of rangers ahead, or place your apothecary opposite an enemy knight with rushing rapids between them while you wear away his armor with acid bottles.Who Is Twin Otter Studios?<br/>Established in 2015, Twin Otter Studios is an independent game studio helmed by Becca and Taylor Bair, a brother and sister duo based in Texas.
