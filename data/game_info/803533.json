You begin at Level 1 with 7 HP. You start out without any weapons, so be careful - you won't be able to do damage with your bare hands.</p>\n<p>Your objective is to guide your character through the dungeon and to get to the last room.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay is divided into two main scenes:</p>\r\nWorld Scene\r\n<p>You observe the map of the dungeon from a Top-Down perspective and must guide your character toward the exit of the current map.</p>\r\nMOVEMENT\r\n<p>You move through each map with the arrow keys, and interact with the world by simply bumping into things. You can bump into...</p>\r\nSIGNS\r\n<p>If you see a sign in the map and bump into it, a message will appear at the bottom of the screen. It's usually important tips!</p>\r\nCHESTS\r\n<p>If a chest contains an item, you will have to make a choice. The bottom dialogue box will display what equipment the chest contains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>X will exchange the currently equipped item for the one in the chest. If you have nothing, you will simply take the equipment and leave an empty chest.</p>\n<p>Z will leave the chest without exchanging anything.</p>\r\nENEMIES\r\n<p>Enemies are spread around the maps, and coming into contact with them will initiate a battle!</p>\n\n<p>Things in the maps you can walk over...</p>\r\nPOTIONS\r\n<p>Will be added to your inventory, and you can use them to recover 5 HP.</p>\r\nKEYS\r\n<p>Necessary to open the locked doors around the dungeon. Will be automatically used when bumping into a door.</p>\r\nSTAIRS\r\n<p>You must walk into a stairs tile to be able to advance to the next map.</p>\n\r\nInfo Display\r\n<p>The Z button while in the world will display over the screen your character's info.</p>\n<p>Name, face, current HP and Level.</p>\n<p>It also shows your current equipment and its value. Weapon will deal that amount of damage, and Armor will decrease taken damage by it's defence value.</p>\n<p>Lower down its the amount of keys and potions you have.

It will damage your enemy in battle equal to its DMG value.</p>\n<p>You start off empty-handed.</p>\r\nARMOR\r\n<p>The armor currently worn by your character. Any time an enemy tries to hit you, the damage will be reduced by the DEF value of the armor.</p>\n<p>You start off without armor.</p>\n\r\nBattle Scene\r\n<p>After bumping into an enemy, the screen will transition to the Battle Screen.</p>\n<p>You will see your character to the left, and your enemy to the right.</p>\r\nACTION SELECT\r\n<p>Using the Up and Down Arrow Keys, the player scrolls between the different options, and selects with X.</p>\n<p>The player can pick 3 options:</p>\r\nATTACK\r\n<p>Your character will use their turn to attack the enemy.</p>\r\nPOTION\r\n<p>Your character will use their turn to attempt to use a potion.

There are so many little things to take into account, and it felt a bit daunting to take in.</p>\n<p>This week, I challenged myself to complete something and just to post it as it was. And boy, it was fun!\u00a0Pretty hard at times, but fun. I am very proud to be able to say I programmed a little RPG System from scratch.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game made in Pico8\r\n</p>\n<p>Design and Programming by KaaSnake\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by KaaSnake\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T16:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1815e7126b57d0d0612cf294fb717f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KaaSnake"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
