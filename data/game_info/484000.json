Inspired by a trip to the Lake District I took with my girlfriend in August 2020, where we climbed Scarfell Pike (the highest mountain in England). <br/></p><p>It was a tough climb - 20K distance and over 1000m climb which took 7 hours (started in Great Langdale).</p><p>Oh - and this is my first ever game jam so hope you enjoy playing my game! Please rate and comment, especially if you make it to the top of the mountain and get to enjoy the view!</p><p>Art: Kenney https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack<br/></p><p>Music: August Hansen https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/electronic/8bit-color-codes-ga...</p><p>SFX: Zero Rare (Levi Moore) https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/sound-fx-retro-pack-121743<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:13:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37f477362187aa0e1afb0eccde636c3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SpartanPG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
