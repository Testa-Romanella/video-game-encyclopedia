Progress is saved to the browser's local storage when possible, but the game is playable in one sitting with local storage disabled. </p>\n<p>This game contains mildly suggestive photographic content and uses abrupt scene transitions which some players might consider jump scares. It contains no nudity and no explicit violence.</p>\n<p>You should be able to complete the game with trial and error using only in-game instructions. If you get frustrated, the downloadable zip of the game includes spoiler text files.</p>\n<p>Art by Suzie Doll (https://flickr.com/people/suzie_doll)\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T15:56:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78b/78bdb482683db0812660f78072f7b20b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["goodbunnystudio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
