Larger ones require a\u00a0<strong>bolas</strong>\u00a0and the biggest ones even two. After catching an animal go to it and one of your sons will bring it to the ark.\u00a0<strong>After sending all three you need to get back.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Combine different items you find to craft tools:\r\nfiber + fiber = rope\r\nrope + fiber = net\r\nrope\u00a0+ stone = bolas\r\nstone + wheat\u00a0=\u00a0<strong>seeds</strong>\u00a0(will spawn a bird you can catch)\r\n<strong>carrot</strong>\u00a0(use it to lure a rabbit)\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>When in the ark watch out for obstacles, as they will cause your animals to fall out. The same goes for sharks that you can fight off by throwing spears. You also have a\u00a0<strong>hunger bar\u00a0</strong>you can fill by catching fish at a site (appears as\u00a0<strong>bubbles</strong>)\r\n</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Music: BePM\r\n(beside the Final Fantasy theme used for meme purposes)\r\n</p>\n<p>Everything else: Me\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T17:13:33", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cymus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
