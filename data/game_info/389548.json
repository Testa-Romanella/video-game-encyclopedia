With our title Double Destruction.</p>\n<p>Your friend has been shrunk down to size! Defend them from tiny ghosts with your lantern while they run around the tabletop dungeon looking for a way to return to normal.</p>\n<p>You will have to work together! Communication and teamwork are key.</p>\n<p>The miniature dungeon raider (VR player) has to find all the Runes to return to normal using their \u2018Rune\u2019 meter on the magical book they carry. The problem is, they are being chased down by ghosts, and it\u2019s pitch black.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s up to their full sized buddy (tablet player) to keep the path lit for the dungeon raider, while also using the very same lantern to also scare away ghosts. Of course they have a slight problem too, a lack of fuel \u2013 calcium carbide if you must know. It\u2019s up to the full-sized player to guide the mini-raider to find fuel hidden around the dungeon in order to keep the lantern going.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nAsynchronous Multiplayer Gameplay\r\n<p>VR Player Features\r\n* Much loved, accessible gameplay from the makers of Smash Hit Plunder\r\n* Hunt using a \u2018Rune\u2019 meter to detect where Runes are hidden\r\n* Find the lantern fuel, guided by the tablet player\r\n* Avoid ghosts in the dark as you navigate the dungeon</p>\n<p>Tablet Player Features\r\n* See the VR Player run around the miniature dungeon as the ghouls hunt them down\r\n* Guide the VR Player to the fuel hidden around the dungeon\r\n* Scare away ghosts with your lantern\r\n* Refill &amp; relight the lantern with really tactile controls\r\n* Adjust how much the lantern is burning in order to preserve fuel, but to also give out enough light to still give the VR Player enough to see, and to scare away ghosts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51d5444565daa793b8804b2720fdb7cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Triangular Pixels"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
