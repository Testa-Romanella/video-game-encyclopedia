The player have to observe the whole puzzle in 3D view before the game start. Then, the main character will become a 2D guy who can only see one surface, which may confuse you. You should reach 5 target points with your memory and spatial perception, and try to clear the level faster and with the shortest path.</p>\n<p>BTW, you will have 3 extra times to observe the 3D level by pressing Space.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p><strong>WASD\u00a0\u00a0</strong>Move</p>\n<p><strong>Space\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong>Switch to 2D/3D view</p>\n<p><strong>LMB\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong>Rotate in 3D view</p>\n<p><strong>MMB\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong>Zoom in 3D view</p>\n<p><strong>RMB\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong>Reset camera in 3D view</p>\n<p><strong>R\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong>Restart the current level</p>\n<p><strong>ESC\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong>Return to menu / Exit the game</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Model:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cute-character-facfe3153da5445ba421c27c3181cc79</p>\n<p>BGM:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/sites/default/files/song17.mp3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T23:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f3/4f3fe60b56e6f19d1899918647196898.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ruiw2006"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
