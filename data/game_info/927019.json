This ultimately fell short of what I'd have liked it to be, but I'm still happy to have put something together.</p>\n<p>The game consists of three battles against simplistic enemies on a 6x3 grid divided into halves - the left half for the player and the right half for the enemies. Before each battle, the player must create a new action for each of their three party members - these actions consist of a \"skill\" which determines which panels on the grid the party member will target, and an \"effect\" which determines what happens to targeted panels.</p>\n<p>If you're in the Boss Rush Jam Discord and find any issues, feel free to ping me (sbebular#3293) - I'm aware of some oddities with animations not playing properly for actions with the SplashDamage effect, but there could easily be something I missed.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T10:37:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7d/c7df6cc169b299855be907194d4194de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sbebular"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
