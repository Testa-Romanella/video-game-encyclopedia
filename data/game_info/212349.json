So he settles for what he can do, which is break things and poop on stuff when no one is around. Be careful not to make too much noise though cause he really doesn't want to get caught cause that would mean he has to talk to people then and that would be bad. </p><p>Misanthropy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mike_Brooks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
