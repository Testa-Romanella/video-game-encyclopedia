The files you are downloading as of May 14, 2021, only contain the 1st level of the game and even that is not complete/finished. You can finish the level but there are sounds missing, textures still don't look quite right, and things still need tweaked. But I just wanted to get it up on the site so people could try it out and tell me what they think.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You're stuck in the Red Room and are trying to find your way back to the grove in the Twin\u00a0Peaks forest. The problem is, everything in the Red Room looks the same. The walls are all red curtains and the floor is just that same black and white pattern over and over again. Diane, Laura, and Mike\u00a0are no help. Agent Cooper has some dopplegangers that are no help either but there may be a helpful Cooper somewhere if we can just find that grove....</p>\n<p>Killer Bob is everywhere, attempting to catch you and put you in his death bag. If you kill him, he drops ammunition and garmonbozia (note: garmonbozia cannot be picked up by the player - it's just left behind when a killer dies). The goal of the first level is to find Leland Palmer. He is a wall sprite, sitting in a chair. Find Leland and destroy his wall sprite. He'll tell you to \"find Laura\" (in backwards speak of course). Behind Leland, there is always a secret. <strong>It's very important that you destroy the Leland Palmer wall sprites otherwise you won't be able to exit the level!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Laura's doppleganger is the final boss in this first level. Once you defeat her, grab the key to the Great Northern hotel and then exit the level by the grove of trees (where the real Agent Cooper can be seen waiting for you).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>SPACE = Open Doors</p>\n<p>ARROW KEYS = Move Character</p>\n<p>CTRL = Shoot Gun<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T09:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/837/83776d0bfa134460848ff58cc52ec806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Droogie4Ever"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
