You play as man (Lawrence) who is quite sick. He is obsessed with the idea of eating dynamite! This uncontrollable urge leads him to sneak into a military base with the intention of eating all the dynamite he can get his hands on. The guards stationed there are obviously not thrilled about this so if they spot Lawrence they will shoot on site! So in short, avoid the guards and eat the dynamite!<br/></p>\n<p>(Use a controller to play) <br/></p><p>Creation timeframe: 1 weekend<br/></p><p>Creators: Xavier and Ibbe<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T07:41:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e2/7e23725c0153c06a28d3b59d007c8bfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XavierNO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
