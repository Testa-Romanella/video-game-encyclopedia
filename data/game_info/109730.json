Humans are modified, merging man and machine as one.\u00a0However, war still ravages around the world despite this breakthrough. Unwittingly, a bio-weapon code named \"Icarus\" has been released. The virus infects humans and in turn machines. It corrupts them and creates a hive mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the verge of extinction, surviving humans have discovered that there is a source which controls the hive mind in different continents across the globe.\u00a0The remaining humans now live in space where they conduct their operations sending out their secret weapon in the hopes of reclaiming Earth once more.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How is the game designed?</strong></p>\n<p>The game will be level based. Within each level, there are rooms to be explored. Most of these rooms are interconnected. There will be one room which will contain the epic boss fight.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How do you play the game?</strong></p>\n<p>Kill everything you encounter, defeat the boss for the level, move on to the next level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you can't beat it on your first go...try UPGRADING your shotgun at the work bench. You earn skill points along the way allowing you to upgrade your weapon stats to suit your liking.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>SHIELDS<ul><li>Cause damage to\u00a0enemies to get more shields<ul><li>After getting 4 shields, you can choose to either keep it to\u00a0protect yourself or you can PRESS E for your SHIELD BURSTS which causing an explosion of bullets</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>LIVES<ul><li>You have 4 limited lives</li></ul></li><li>DASH<ul><li>You have a dash ability which has a maximum of 2 consecutive dashes which will replenish over time</li></ul></li><li>WEAPONS</li><ul><li>You have can only have\u00a02 different weapons at anytime</li><ul><li>A shotgun which has limited ammo but powerful</li><li>A pistol which has unlimited ammo but weak</li></ul></ul></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Left Click - fire weapon\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>W - move forward \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Escape - quit to\u00a0menu</p>\n<p>S - move backward\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Scroll mouse wheel - Change Weapon</p>\n<p>A - move left\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Q - Shield Bursts</p>\n<p>D - move right\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 E - Interact</p>\n<p>R - reload weapon\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Space Bar -Dash\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Our team is made up of 2 people,\u00a0Austin and Andrew!\u00a0\u00a0We have been working on this project since February 2018.
