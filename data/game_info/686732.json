There are nine tables, and in each table there are nine slots.<br/>The position of the slot a player puts their symbol in, will determine in which one of the tables the other player will need to put their symbol in the next turn.<br/>For example: the X player puts an X in the top left slot of a table, so the O player will need to put an O in the top left table.<br/>When one table has a line of three of the same symbol in it, the whole table turns into that symbol.<br/>The winner is the player who's got a line of three tables that turned into their symbol.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T12:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d51/d51648aaf9547b0577829ee6259bb1a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FutureYT"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
