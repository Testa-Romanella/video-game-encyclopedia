What will our hero do?</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>A pet project I had while teaching friends a few things about coding by making games with GB Studio 1.x. Based on a fan comic (link here) by my good friend elAlvaradog (aka Wan Shot Comics - <strong><em>Warning: NSFW content in the account</em></strong>) originally released in 2019, with a successful kickstarter for a re-release last year (2020).<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a very short game. I estimate you may take about 10-15 minutes in your first playthrough, and around 5 minutes in the following ones. There's a total of 9 endings you can earn based on your actions.</p>\n<p>It is a game made for fun, and more rushed than I want to admit. Still, I hope you all can have fun playing it, just as I (sort of and masochistically) did while making it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e62e814412fc433ca9f0a65c3914152.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gemahBearguar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
