The concept of the game is simply to gather collectables and reassemble corpse parts. This is a concept we plan on making into a full game eventually, but we have a lot of stuff to learn still. Oh and by the way the head has an ability tied to the shift key but I didnt make it obvious in the game so sorry if you get stuck because of that.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:31:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b09/b09664f70ae933eaddf5b438cf883f8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["travp333"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
