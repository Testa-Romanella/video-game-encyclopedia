Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don&#39;t get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last.<br />\nChoose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You&#39;ll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don&#39;t worry. As time goes by, you&#39;ll become stronger and stronger. Decide freely in a sophisticated skill system, which strengths should have your<em>s climber</em>in.<br />\nIn the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events.<br />\nThree mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don&#39;t have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can&#39;t always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought.<br />\nFace the challenge of ever new and changing dangers, face snowstorms and the sheer force of nature, always keep your eyes on the summit and overcome the insurmountable.Keyfeatures<br />\nno two climbs are alike<br />\nprocedurally generated mountains<br />\ndynamic world with different weather effects<br />\nhundreds of events with ever-changing outcomes<br />\nstrategic gameplay in path finding, stat and equipment management<br />\n3 characters with different abilities</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-10T23:12:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90b/90b784ce8cb248f5eb5410a7e49adec8.jpg", "website": "https://www.byterockers.games/", "rating": 2.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 57, "owned": 101, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 16, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 414, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 20, "platforms": ["PlayStation 5", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series S/X", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["ByteRockers' Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Daedalic Entertainment", "ByteRockers' Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
