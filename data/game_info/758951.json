{"id": 758951, "slug": "sunlight-forest", "name": "Sunlight Forest", "name_original": "Sunlight Forest", "description": "<p>Sunlight Forest is a short game a created for Week 245 of the Weekly Game Jam.</p>\n<p>This was a project I worked on by myself and I created the gameplay mechanics and the level. All the assets used were free off of the Unreal Marketplace and the house asset was free off TurboSquid.</p>\n<p>I was not able to make the best use of the full allotted time due to other commitments. But I am happy with what I did do by myself in such a small space of time. Ideally I would have finished off the enemies properly so they could actually attack the\u00a0player and I would have liked to have added some sounds. I also would have liked to make the level a little longer and more complexed but I\u00a0wanted to keep the scope of the project\u00a0achievable.</p>\n<p>I was experiencing some computer troubles with Unreal crashing on me a fair few times. This prevented me from adding as many trees as I would have wanted and making the level feel like a proper forest and this would give the surrounding environment a much better feel.</p>\n<p>Overall, I am satisfied with what I created for my first ever game jam and look forward to doing more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T07:29:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3eb/3ebc85c05dad441f9012c0817f51a4be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GilesGameDesign"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
