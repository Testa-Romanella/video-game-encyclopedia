The longer you keep holding the taller it will get. <br/>As soon as you think it's high enough, release the click. If the ladder\u2019s length is ideal, it will fall onto the next platform, forming a bridge, so you can cross it. <br/><br/>The more accurate your reflex is, the more points and more levels you will conquer.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T09:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbfc002e97bc28ee7ff9774768833137.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yellow Panda Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
