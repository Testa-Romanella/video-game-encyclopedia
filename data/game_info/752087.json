The wreckage is mostly other unlucky vessels just like yours\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFORTUNATELY,  you are the captain of a championship drone fighting team, so you might have a chance to escape this mess. You send your prized fighting drone into the belt to collect the materials you need to patch up your ship.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUNFORTUNATELY, the rocks are home to a horde of alien cyborgs and your champion fightbot is repeatedly devoured, destroyed, humiliated, and sent home with its charred tail between its smoking legs.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWill you finally make it to the centre of the asteroid belt where the sweet sweet scrap lies?   Will you repair your ship and turn this nightmare into a knee-slapping story over pints at the Mangledrome?  Or will your sluggish reflexes, numbed by cryo-sleep, succumb to the alien horde?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCaptain?  Can you hear me... Captain?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFEATURES:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-   \tAn innovative core gameplay loop - feels like breakdancing in space.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-   \tA smorgasbord of horribly cute alien cyborgs<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-   \tProcedurally generated maps.  Each run is WILDLY different. (Okay not that different)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-   \tA roguelike metagame to keep you grinding for infinitesimal morsels of progress until you can\u2019t remember what day it is. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-   \tA groovy synth soundtrack that\u2019s worth the price of the game right there<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-   \tMildly entertaining dialogue delivered by two dimensional characters who don\u2019t move their lips.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWARNING:  This product has not been widely tested. Known side-effects include uncontrollable fist-pumping, \u2018tetris-y\u2019 vibes, disco dancing, sudden bursts of uncharacteristic profanity, and, in one worrysome case, laughing like a deranged gibbon.
