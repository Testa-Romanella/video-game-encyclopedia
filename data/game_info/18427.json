So you cannot count on pounding your keyboard to achieve victory like in most athletics games. You require good timing and mental strength.<br/><br/>At first, you run and jump in a disjointed fashion, causing funny situations. However, the better you get, the more your actions resemble those of true champions and it becomes very rewarding.<br/><br/>A third key allows to lean forward on certain occasions: to finish a sprint, a jump, or to jump over a hurdle.Game Modes<ul><li><strong>Solo</strong>: compete against increasingly strong opponents and become a champion in each event.<br/></li><li><strong>Splitscreen</strong>: play against 3 friends on the same computer (gamepad supported), like in this hilarious video.<br/></li><li><strong>Online</strong><br/><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Confront the world record and your friends' records.<br/></li><li>Challenge mode: compete against increasingly strong records from the leaderboards and become a concurrent for other players.<br/></li><li>Daily Contest : experience the stress of competition with a limited number of attempts each day.
