So it is not surprising that his online ratings are at an all-time low. The global pizza bank is about to cancel his loans if his sales do not increase significantly.   </p>\n<p>Fortunately, he is a smart guy and knows how to avoid the worst. He sets out to visit the old witch in the forest. She is eager to help and provides him with a special spice that is sure to make his pizza taste incredibly good. In no time, he struggles to catch up with the ever-growing demand for his new pizza.\r\n </p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s your turn! You\u2019re his delivery driver - can you help him deliver all pizzas on time?\r\n </p>\n<p>But wait! The witch has a vicious plan to gain control of the entire planet. She has poisoned the spice with a zombie fungus that is spreading rapidly. So you need to be extra fast to prevent the zombies from gaining world domination.\r\n  </p>\n\r\nWhat the press says\r\n\r\nSo if you are too slow, more and harder Zombies spawn, slowing you down even more<em>? </em><strong>What\u00a0a chain-reaction! </strong>\n<p>~ my roommate,\u00a02021\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming:<br/>- PositiveZeroGames<br/>- Bruno<br/></p>\n<p>Music:<br/>-\u00a0http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/cyba/60166<br/>-\u00a0https://freesound.org/<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nIf you made it all the way down here already, you might as well\u00a0 vote for us  :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:07:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcdf37b9a004b73d24995d470f987fa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Positive Zero"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
