Looking for a change of sights, three friends, a Miner, a Native and\u00a0a Cowboy, embark on a journey to find an escape from this land. They find an abandoned spaceship, which is missing some components. Determined to take this chance, they split and search for the missing materials.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><strong>This game</strong>\u00a0<strong>was\u00a0</strong></strong>developed\u00a0for the final project\u00a0of my Game Development course as a collaboration of 4 different subjects (curricular units). In it's native form, it includes communication with a website and app (HTML, CSS, JS, NODE JS, CORDOVA, IONIC)\u00a0through a server made in JS. The map was modelled in Blender.<br/></p>\n\n<p>NOTE:\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the Single Player version! Each pawn can only pickup one item and the cowboy has 2 moves. After picking up the item, the final objective is to move to the spaceship.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/542/542b61bee52c904028c3ca51e6c3eff8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WiredDrummer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
