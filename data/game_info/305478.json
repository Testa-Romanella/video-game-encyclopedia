Completely retreating from society, he rants, describes, and relates his self-contradictory, absurd, and spiteful nature in a fervent attack on the collective dreams of his time and its inability to grasp the irrationality of human desire and volition. Part philosophic tirade and part narrative, Notes from Underground displays Dostoyevsky's keen insight into the depths of the human psyche.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Adapted by BillWilson<br/>Uses Images and Sprites from AlmondFlower, Brian Jeffery Beggerly, sapiboonggames, MikiTakamoto, City Foodsters, Ralf Roletschek, \"white peach flower\" (http://hakutouka.com/freesozai.html), Tokudaya (http://tokudaya.net), Neil Williams, Nikolai Karaneschev, Ted McGrath, and Jtrawleigh<br/>Uses Sound Effects from \"Let's Play with Free Sound Effects\" http://taira-komori.jpn.org/freesounden.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T04:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/428916d7f258d9e375a60d2fafb8eea9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BillWilson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
