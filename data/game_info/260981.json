So I decided last minute to create a fps prototype. After some thinking I came up with some way to spread your (dual-wielding) guns like a Mexican standoff.\u00a0</p>\r\nSplit view\r\n<p>My first approach was making the player able to split the screen in half so that there was one screen for each eye. When the player pressed RMB and dragged the mouse to the right, they would \u2018tear\u2019 the screen apart and create the split view.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This came with its fair share of problems. I couldn\u2019t figure out to get this to work when the player was turned around. Because the \u2018tearing\u2019 of the screen and rotating the player both used the Unity Mouse axis. So decided to take another approach which in my opinion also makes a little more sense.</p>\r\nFOV\r\n<p>That brought me to the second and final approach. This way all the information is still in your screen (nothing is out of frame because of the narrow FOV of the split screens) and some nice cinematic black bars appear. Which I am actually pretty proud of. How it works is that when the player scrolls: the field of view changes, the camera rect gets shorter and the camera rect is moved up to stay in the center of the screen (if you don\u2019t do this the top of the camera rect just moves down. I found out that the formula to achieve this effect was: screen y position (Y) = (1 - screen height) / 2.</p>\n\n<p>Because unfortunately I can\u2019t work full-time on games yet, this prototype isn\u2019t as fleshed out as I\u2019d like but I hope you get the idea I want to get across.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c6/8c6f04280b634d86f7f5cb6799ba031d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FriedCandle"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
