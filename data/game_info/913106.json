I\u00a0am having an incredibly fun time and I am honestly gratified and amazed this is what I\u00a0came up with in one week. Now that my youthful optimism is out of the way... Yes the game is super lame, all you do is hop over enemies and if you touch them the game resets. I absolutely had to publish this version though because I wanted myself and the world to have a point of reference. I\u00a0also am including my coding journal file in the folder, it's like my mental state and thought process during the time I\u00a0spent coding.</p>\n<p>Please be nice because I have a fragile feelings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:27:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb1/eb1a879b6f2000e5a3d54ab69c5aa84b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TreddoIstandski"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
