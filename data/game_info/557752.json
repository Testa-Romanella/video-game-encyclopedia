Which means, the universe may not be flat, but on the surface of a bigger sphere, just as we are on the earth, everyone is standing at the center of the planet.<br/><br/>The universe is not a round pie envisaged in the standard model, but a four-dimensional space-time boundary similar to a three-dimensional sphere. This three-dimensional space-time boundary is not flat. Far away, three dimensions will gradually bend, and each dimension is a circle.<br/><br/>Dr. Valentino, a researcher from the University of Manchester, recently revealed through the analysis of the observational data of the Planck satellite that the universe may not be as flat as a bed sheet, but a closed three-dimensional sphere similar to a huge balloon. Hubble expansion is the process of expanding the entire balloon; everything is increasing in size.The paper is recently published on Nature:<br/>Di Valentino, E., Melchiorri, A. &amp; Silk, J. Nat Astron 4, 196\u2013203 (2020). <br/><br/>Our story begins here.<br/><br/>Today, our Milky Way, similar to all other galaxies, sits on the sphere of the universe equally and ordinary.<br/><br/>However, it is not an ordinary three-dimensional sphere, but a four-dimensional one.<br/>The spherical surface of a three-dimensional sphere is two-dimensional, similar to our surface; that of a four-dimensional sphere is three-dimensional, and every dimension is curved in the distance.<br/>The four-dimensional space-time boundary looks like as follows:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Given the existence of a fourth dimension, wormholes can be observed.<br/>As revealed during The Strings Conference 2020, wormholes are actually common. Time travel is possible.<br/><br/>As time goes by, all scales become large. If a past civilization exists, then it is smaller than it is now.<br/>If the past civilization passed through wormholes and came to today's time, would it not be a small world? Let's start the game and explore lives within such mini civilizations.<br/><br/><br/>This is a game for physics lovers and history lovers. <br/><br/>Its UI menu interface reflected its own scientific attributes: planets moving on the curvature of space-time caused by gravitational fields. <br/>Then you can choose a star/planet, such as the Moon or the Mars, for a landing-on adventure on an expedition rover, or you can navigate the space from the perspective of a spacecraft.<br/><br/>But if you think this game is just such a space simulator, then you underestimate it. The aforementioned contents are only 5% of the game.<br/><br/>In fact, this game has very rich time and space travel and space exploration functions, and it has great fun: <br/>You can drive a spaceship, explore different kinds of extraterrestrial planets, and in a far away galaxy called Magda Nebula, you will fight the alien fleet and experience the space battle described in the 'Independence Day' movie. <br/>You can also build your own world, in the center of the earth, like many Minecraft-like voxel games, you will create a paradise of Verne fantasy. <br/>You can also decrypt the secrets of the Relativity, and observe the world seen by a traveler riding a photon by flying at 90% speed of light. <br/>You can also travel through wormholes, and come to some lost historical periods: Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, Medieval Dark Ages, etc., and to defend their civilization with your fighting system.<br/><br/>It is not a prefect game yet, but this is our endeavor to introduce real physics into games.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T03:00:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1db23806b6310488f85581249e78a2d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William at Oxford"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["William at Oxford"], "esrb_rating": null}
