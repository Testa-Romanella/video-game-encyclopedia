This won\u2019t stop Octo\u2019s passion for seashells though! Help Octo collect \u00a0the more you can.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Navigate to the Controls menu to select gamepad or mouse &amp; keyboard input. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Collect seashells to increase your score. Only Octo\u2019s head is vulnerable, don\u2019t worry too much about your tentacles.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Development:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>OctoPop is my first attempt at Unity and game development in general. No assets were used, I made everything from the sprites to the sound design. <br/></p>\n<p>OctoPop game mechanics are heavily inspired by Bizarre Creation<strong>s\u2019</strong> Geometry Wars but in a totally different setting and with a bit of bullet hell to spice things up.<br/></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a very early release and  I\u2019d like to continue working on this project, so please consider supporting through donation. Please report any bug you encounterand, also I\u2019ll be glad to take any suggestion or critisicm you may have to improve the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the roadmap for future versions:</p>\n<ul><li>Add missing sounds</li><li>Add options menu</li><li>Add more vegetation and stuff</li><li>Add more FX</li><li>Animate enemies</li><li>Add eels as a new enemy</li><li>Better enemy spawning waves</li><li>Adjust difficulty to be more progressive</li><li>2 Players score battle</li><li>2 Players copilot</li><li>Online Leaderboard</li><li>Octo skins to unlock</li><li>More game modes</li><li>More levels</li><li>Release on all available plateforms</li><li>Mobile version</li></ul>\n\n<p>Tank you for playing ! pew pew :3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T02:49:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44c/44c04d32fe54caaf28a529505b3cce86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Black Hole Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
