In this sprint, I did not have any new features\r\nfor the user. I did, however, organize and\u00a0group the UI so it would be\r\nmore appealing to the users and more intuitive. I added more buttons to\r\nrandomize the object types and destroy time. All attributes\u00a0will now work\r\non existing objects and can be changed dynamically. Previously, the user had to\r\nmake the\u00a0change and only then the new spawned objects would inherit the\r\nupdate. I have defaulted the keyboard buttons 1-3 as animation effects and 4-6\r\nas objects to spawn. The UI can also be\u00a0hidden so that the user can have\r\nthe entire screen to paint on.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:11:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f9/5f9c4e915131e635559c638fdc5fdc8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["manuelavila"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
