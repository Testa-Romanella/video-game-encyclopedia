I just completed the first day of the visual novel I am working on called \"That One Celestial Night\" I put some effort into making it just by myself so hopefully the art, the story, and the writing would be tolerable enough to see and read.</p>\n<p>Im making this VN novel with the intention of creating somewhat the same experience that Echo gave me, so the vn will focus more on trauma, horror, and drama rather than romance and nsfw content, those would still be present but will not be the focus of the story, I'll try my hardest to somehow make that happen and hopefully it won't disappoint.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I hope you guys would give it a try and tell me what you think about it, all feedback would be greatly appreciated! xd</p>\n<p>- LeiNavI</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T14:49:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b763f03ec5b734b7b6100ecec05cc72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["LeiNavI78"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
