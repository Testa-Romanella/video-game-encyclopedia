The more you advance, the harder the levels become.</p>\n<p>There are other <em>elements </em>that will help you to keep going (enhanced with the movement and the hold for jumping ability) as bouncers, gravity changers, size shrinkers/normalizers, and keys needed to open locked doors.</p>\n<p>Not everything is easy, so, the game can be something <em>hard</em> in some levels, and your patience can be over soon, try to collect the coins around all the levels and try to end the game with the less count of retries as to make your own record.</p>\n<p>That's not all, because you can change the <em>colour </em>of the whole game, then, you can play with the colour that's more confortable for you (or your eyes, more specially).</p>\n<p>You need to leave the darkness, try to finish the <em>10 levels</em> I've prepared! Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39b350e161341bb25f709286fc7c704d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dyrran"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
