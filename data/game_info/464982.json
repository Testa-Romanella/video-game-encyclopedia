Once you run out of them, you can only repeat your previous sequence of actions.</p>\n<p>This means that if you Attack an enemy, then Loot it and finally Speak to a NPC, your next actions must be Attack some other enemy, Loot something else, and Speak to another NPC.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Game Design and Programming: Leonardo Giovanni Scur</p>\n<p>This game uses the following assets:</p>\n<ul><li>Kenney's Castle, Fantasy Town, and Nature Kits;</li><li>Chibi Human by Etherlyte;</li><li>Demigiant DOTween;</li><li>Gladius and Hearts icons by Skoll;</li><li>Nothing to Say and Swap Bag icons by Lorc;</li><li>Select icon by sbed;</li></ul>\n<p>I would also like to thank Sirenix for their awesome Odin Inspector, and Anthony Marmont for his AssetIcons, which helped a lot the development of this game.</p><p><strong>BUT I LIKED THE IDEA</strong><br/></p><p>I put the project files up on GitHub, feel free to open it and make your own levels.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11e/11e9f5aa00d6aa5c8fc93910933efd0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kroltan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
