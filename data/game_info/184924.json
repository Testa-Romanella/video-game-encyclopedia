It's a prototype of a platformer with a world changing gimmick. That is, you can change the world you are jumping in by taking a piece of the world and switching it with a different one. \u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, we are not quite happy with how it turned out. If we ever continue this project, we would probably make sure that the controls are tighter and the level design fully explores the changeable nature of the world. \u00a0In the end I don't know if a platformer is the best genre for this gimmick. Maybe more of a puzzle game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/663/66353ccf7e9682914ef7230d0bc501ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MetjuPerry"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
