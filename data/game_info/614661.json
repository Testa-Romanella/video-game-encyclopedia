However it didn't work for me so I had to make my own system based on Leo's code, and this is the result. There are actually no voxels in this game, just a lot of cubes that become \"moveable\" when hit. I'm planning on developing this project further, so subscribe to my youtube and itch.io</p>\n<p>yes, I just copy-pasted everything from the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:16:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82c/82c991777309b6693da9500183dde24a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lelaksi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
