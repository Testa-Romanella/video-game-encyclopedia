{"id": 778464, "slug": "night-watch-at-wilfords", "name": "Night Watch At Wilford's", "name_original": "Night Watch At Wilford's", "description": "<p>The year is 1983. Times are tough for Wilford Wombat's Funtime Pizzeria. Though this place is no stranger to all manner of odd controversies, rampant  rumors of upper management's shady dealings and their well-worn\u00a0animatronics taking on a vengeful life of their own aren't doing their reputation any favors.</p>\n<p>With no other available employment for you in this part of town, you take on the role as the Pizzaria's sole overnight security guard. At first, it's pretty much what you expected: pretty uneventful, non-rewarding, minimal pay. However, you'll witness what really happens after hours, and it's not anything you bargained for not want any part in.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong></p>\n<p> CONTROLS:<br/>(Based on the original Atari joystick controller; feel free to map to any keys/buttons you wish)<br/>Left/Right: focus on one of the side doors in your office.<br/>Left/Right + Up: open one of the side doors.<br/>Left/Right + Down: close one of the side doors.<br/>Left/Right + Fire: Turn on either door light.<br/>Down then Fire (red button): Shut off all power; can be used in emergency situations.*<br/>Up then Fire: Set off emergency alarm.**<br/>No joystick motion, then hold Fire: enter security camera mode.<br/>Hold Fire, then Joystick in any direction: switch security camera feeds.<br/>B/W Switch: pause game<br/>Left difficulty switch: Activate/deactivate Dave the Devil (see below)<br/>Right difficulty switch: Enable/disable power usage handicaps (see below)<br/></p>\n<p> * You'll have a limited amount of time to do this. When the right  difficulty switch is set to B, it will slowly replenish when the power's  back on. It will not if it's set to A.  <br/> ** When the right difficulty switch is set to A, this will cease to function if you can no longer switch off the power.   \u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n<p> The amount of power you have left is shown in the left stamina bar. The amount of power being used at once is shown in the right.  </p>\n<p> The following actions will consume power, so do them strategically:<br/>- Checking the security cameras<br/>- Closing the doors (I'm happy to say that whoever designed those doors in your office was fired before they were finished installing them)<br/>- Turning on the door lights<br/>- Setting off the emergency alarm  </p>\n<p> \u00a0  </p>\n<p> You'll have to deal with five animatronics:<br/>- <strong>Wilford the Wombat:</strong> currently, he'll only attack you once you run out of power. Planning on incorporating fully functional \"AI.\"<br/>- <strong>Carol Caw:</strong> Goes after you through the rooms on the  left of your office. Very persistent.<br/>- <strong>May the Monster</strong> (considering a different name): Goes  after you through the rooms on the right of your office, including an  area whose camera can't pick up any video signals at this time. Rather  erratic in her movements and extremely aggressive. May be slightly buggy  as of right now.<br/>- <strong>Dave the Crane:</strong> Will slowly emerge from the second  show stage before charging straight for your office (through the left  door). This can be avoided by checking the cameras frequently and  shutting your left door whenever he does come to get you.<br/>- <strong>Dave the Devil:</strong> Will only appear when the left  difficulty switch is set to A. He'll attack you directly if you look at  the cameras too much at once or if you've exhausted your ability to shut  off the power. David the Devil was featured during the establishment's  first year or so of business, but promptly retired and replaced with a  shoddily-built crane when a bit of controversy broke out over it. \r\n<br/></p>\n<p>The basic design framework of this game was based upon the original <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>, released by Scott Cawthon in 2014.<br/>Special thanks to the AtariAge and FNaF communities for making this game possible.<br/>You may also download the game and keep up with its development on this thread:<br/>https://atariage.com/forums/topic/333833-wip-night-watch-at-wilfords-five-nights...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T06:31:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76b4be1c6895a4a6ea905790d7265363.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixRuss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
