This game is based on raiderop's idea; if you don't know about this event, lemme explain. This event asks you to give an idea  and we choose one of the ideas to make a game on the weekend. If you want to know more join our discord server: https://discord.io/codekeys+</p>\n<p>OFC TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF YOUR FIRST \u00a0DEATH AND POST IT IN OUR DISCORD SERVER FOR ROASTI- I MEAN FUN PURPOSES.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Click to shoot<br/>Aim with mouse<br/>Move from knock-back (recoil) force. The more distant you aim the more recoil force is exerted on the player (I mean these are simple physics, if you don't understand this, then.....).<br/>Click Esc to close the game<br/></p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:\u00a0</strong>My recent game was played by a few ppl and some of them had been saying that the game was too challenging. So, If you somehow live under a rock and you don't know the ABCD of gaming, then I am afraid this game is not for you.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T18:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f13b8f27081b721e233922fc9036064.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CodeKeys Community"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
