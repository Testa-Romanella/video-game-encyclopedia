Only a small fraction of society managed to survive the turmoil, but due to heavy pollution, still faced extinction. <br/><br/>The chosen ones left the Earth and traveled to Lobos, a planet in the Alpha Centauri, and lost contact with the Earth.  Some of those left behind were lucky enough to find refuge in underground vaults. The screams of those, who didn\u2019t, were heard long after the vaults were slammed shut... <br/><br/>After many years, the government regenerated the environment on Earth's surface using special types of machines known as \u201cHydra\u201d-class nature generators. The plan succeeded, but\u2026 it had side-effects.<br/><br/><br/><br/>STORYIn the game, you control a character, who is a great-grandchild of the first residents of one of the vaults. You become a part of the W.A.R.P. organization, which manages the underground bunkers. W.A.R.P\u2019s mission is to maintain contact between the lower, living part of the vaults and those, who went out to re-settle the deserted Earth and provide the vaults with necessary supplies.<br/><br/><br/>As a mercenary, you will be performing all kinds of tasks for the organization, from the easy ones like patrolling and replacing relays, to secret missions ordered by the most influential people in the organization. This will not be easy though - other mercenaries are not your comrades, but competition...<br/><br/>What dangers will you find lurking on the face of Earth? Will you manage to survive? And what has become of those who left for Lobos...?<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T13:07:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c1/9c17922393f698f66d1f68147cdb6bba.jpg", "website": "http://edengrad.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 30, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 423, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Huckleberry Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Huckleberry Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
