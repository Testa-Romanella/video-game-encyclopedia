It contains graphic violence, gore, surrealist horror, potential body horror, waking nightmares, and death.\r\n<p><strong>Mousetrap</strong> is a surrealist survival horror story written by Albie for the @interact-if\u00a02022 ranked game jam.</p>\r\nThe Story\r\n<p>You're one of the many overworked interns working at Whimsey World. When it was announced that Imogen, a category three hurricane, would soon hit Orlando, Florida, your employers asked for volunteers to remain in the parks during the storm, promising triple pay for at least 24 hours. You and your friend seized the opportunity. After all, Whimsey wouldn't ask its cast members to stay behind if it was potentially dangerous.\r\n</p>\n<p>That's what you assumed <em>before </em>you were knocked unconscious. <em>Before </em>you woke up in a costume chained to your friend and three strangers. <em>Before </em>Dickey the Rat informed you and your \"team\" that you get $250,000 for each person you kill. <em>Before </em>the neurotoxins pumping through the park's air system began to loosen your grip on reality. <em>Before </em>nightmares and the real world bled into a horrifying, broken fantasy you can't wake up from.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you survive the storm (and the things lurking within it), you'll win riches beyond your wildest dreams. But how far are you willing to go? How committed are you to pleasing your guests and satisfying your spectators? The Show <em>will </em>go on. <em>It will always go on</em>. But what role will <em>you </em>play in it?</p>\r\nThe Cast\r\n<p><strong><em>Alaric/Aria Wagner</em></strong><strong> - </strong>your optimistic and level-headed friend\u00a0from Germany working in merchandise as part of a work exchange program\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Emerson Liu</strong></em> - a fellow intern who works as a custodian, an aspiring novelist with an insatiable thirst for truth and unending curiosity\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Jovy Rivera</strong></em> - a full-time stagehand and gaffer for the park's stage shows, an extremely sarcastic individual who hates having to take things seriously\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Max Keller</em></strong><strong> - </strong>a part-time face character, part-time med student with a personality opposite those of the viallainous or chaotic characters\u00a0 they portray\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A Wagner can be male or female, Emerson is female, Jovy is nonbinary, and Max can be male, female, or nonbinary</li></ul>\r\nTimeline\r\n<p>Since the voting period for this game jam lasts throughout\u00a0February, I can only\u00a0make\u00a0smaller patches to correct bugs and spelling/grammar during this time. On March 1st you can expect a big update that adds new content and expands upon content currently in the story.</p><p>The voting process for this game jam runs through February, so, until then\u00a0this story can only be updated with small bug patches. A big update is scheduled for\u00a0March 1st that will add a lot of new content and expand upon existing choices.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you want more info on the project and how it's developing,\u00a0check out\u00a0the Mousetrap Tumblr blog (here).</p>\r\nThis game was created\u00a0as part of\u00a0the 2022 Interact-IF ranked game jam.
