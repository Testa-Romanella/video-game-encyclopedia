{"id": 529692, "slug": "flappy-zeppa", "name": "Flappy Zeppa", "name_original": "Flappy Zeppa", "description": "<p>\"Flappy Zeppa\" is 5-level arcade variation of Flappy Bird game.</p>\n<p>Zeppelin Zeppa during her air journey tries to collect valuable coins. She shouldn't touch the sun, baloons or hit the mountains. There are 3 kinds of upgrades to buy between the levels.</p>\n<p>I've made this small game to learn basics of Unity designing, especially spawning, moving, animating objects, adding some SFX and working with layers. It was big fun till the moment my 6-years daughter said: \"Daddy, I like it but you should make a shop\". \"What? Ehm... OK\". So during next 2 weeks I've been creating simple shop and upgrades for my daughter.<br/>I realized that it's very difficult to finish the project (especially at the end), just stop adding new \"better\" functionalities, stop permanently reviewing the code. Most of \"small changes that will surely improve my game\" appeared to be time wasters.<br/>----<br/>Healthbar script from Tilevania tutorial by Ben Tristem, Gamedev.tv<br/>Backgrounds: https://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=101848<br/>night photo: https://unsplash.com/photos/xjM0j6qBPGM Nathan Anderson<br/>Music: Sunken Streets https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Sro/Vol_1_New_Blok_Dreams/Sunken_Streets<br/>Sounds&amp;SFX: most from Kenney Assets (www.kenney.nl)<br/>Banthers font: https://www.behance.net/gallery/29369733/Banthers-Free-Font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T07:30:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/342/34215a96139c21de40330d9d2f0c8563.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["procraststudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
