{"id": 20315, "slug": "evoland-2", "name": "Evoland 2", "name_original": "Evoland 2", "description": "<p>Evoland 2 is an indie role-playing game developed by Shiro Games. It is the second installment in the Evoland series.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The players travel through four time periods which differ in their historical setting. The art style of each period matches 8-bit graphics, Nintendo&#39;s Game Boy graphics, 16-bit graphics, and finally 3D graphics. You play as Kuro, who sets out to the past to change the fate of humanity and the outcome of a war between the powerful demons. Players change the past in order to affect the present.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is fairly linear, but it opens up at some point of the story. The fighting system of the game consists of both real-time fights and turn-based battles. The players are free to explore the in-game world from a bird&#39;s view perspective. It is possible to search for collectibles that are placed in secret areas around the game&#39;s levels. </p>\n<p>The game pays tribute to numerous games. Most of these tributes are made during the game. While the main part of the game closely resembles the Legend of Zelda game series, the players will participate in a Street Fighter parody game or a sidequest mini-game that was inspired by Final Fantasy. </p>\n<p>There is a lot of humor present in the game. Sometimes the main characters will make remarks on the events happening around them and comment on the gameplay saying that it reminds them of some game they know about.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2e117a863a87367d2589a7b0d6d4854_hFYCmjZ.jpg", "website": "http://www.evoland2.com/", "rating": 3.65, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 103, "owned": 1228, "beaten": 88, "toplay": 34, "dropped": 56, "playing": 14}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 38, "ratings_count": 166, "suggestions_count": 410, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 167, "platforms": ["Android", "macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Plug In Digital", "Playdigious", "Shiro Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital", "Playdigious", "Shiro Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
