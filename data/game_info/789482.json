Well I decided to make my own version as my first game ever. This was a school assignment to make some version of an arcade game and make everything from scratch in Windows Forms. So everything you see - all the pictures, all the scenes and all the code in C# is mine. Unfortunatelly there are deadlines in this world, so the game has some bugs. But I still think it is very playable and even enjoyable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T22:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d057f196450495c56e4aebda6e8cef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tereza Kadle\u010dkov\u00e1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
