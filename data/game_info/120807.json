Please use an alternative web browser if you wish to play this game online.<br/></p><p>This is my take on the classic Minesweeper game. The objective is to clear the minefield without revealing any mines, with a twist: there is depth added to the minefield! </p><p>Controls:</p><p>Left Mouse Button: reveal cube, navigate menus</p><p>Right Mouse Button: rotate minefield</p><p>F: place/remove flag</p><p>Spacebar: reset minefield rotation</p><p>I have included a standalone player download and the source code download (Unity 5 is required) if you want them!</p><p>Note: there is currently only 1 difficulty level. I will be updating the game in the future with harder difficulties.</p><p>UPDATE LOG</p><p>14/03/2016- Added 'medium' difficulty level. Added victory by flagging all of the mines. Added shading on cubes so that the further away they are, the darker they appear.</p><p>Bug fixes:</p><p>- Fixed a bug that caused some numbers/mine objects to generate floating instead of attached to a cube face.</p><p>- Fixed the in-game instructions being disabled after the first game.</p><p>03/02/2016- Major overhaul of art direction and user interface. Changes to code in preparation for future updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b98a12088b26ffa7b1540a2582de7cb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["SnedHlepPls"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
