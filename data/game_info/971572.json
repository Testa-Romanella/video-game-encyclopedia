He has to chase the cows with his dog, milk the cows, feed them, and carry the milk in buckets slowly without spilling. You can also take a car to explore and talk to the villagers. Together with the owner, breeders, veterinarians, and industrial technicians, you will make the farm prosperous. If there is too much feces, the ranch will be shut down if the animals get sick. Also, this hero sometimes loses motivation to work. At such times, sleeping well at home and drinking milk directly from the cows will increase his motivation. It is necessary to avoid submitting a letter of resignation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe nomadic call of \u201ckhoomii\" can be used to gather grazing cattle. The pasture has a thermometer and a clock to indicate the time. Hungry cows begin an abnormal behavior called tonguerolling, in which they stick out their tongues, curl them up, and lick them. The values from the veterinarian's blood test can be viewed on a smartphone to know the values for each individual cow. Also, stressed cows have high levels of adrenocortical hormone, which can be reduced by having their backs scratched with a machine called a cow brush, but you have to pay 25 credits in game money to the engineer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T20:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a4de7a8d80b15d572b5e0c64f1555cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boujin \u3010\u68d2\u9663\u3011"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Boujin \u3010\u68d2\u9663\u3011"], "esrb_rating": null}
