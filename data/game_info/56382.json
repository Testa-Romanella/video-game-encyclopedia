{"id": 56382, "slug": "cauldron", "name": "Cauldron", "name_original": "Cauldron", "description": "<p>Cauldron is a two-dimensional (2D) shoot 'em up/platformer computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace). The game was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a witch, who aims to become the \"Witch Queen\" by defeating an enemy called the \"Pumpking\".</p>\n<p>Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron originated as a licensed video game of the horror film Halloween. Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized that there were no technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.</p>\n<p>The game received praise from video game magazines, who focused on the graphics and two different modes of play. A common complaint was Cauldron's excessive difficulty. The following year, Palace released a direct sequel titled Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c5541965215fa291e22d0525b49c3008.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Palace Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Palace Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
