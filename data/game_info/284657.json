The other king is stronger and he doesn't like yu! Ve must take from him... evvveryzing!</p>\n<p>Short tutorial:</p>\n<p>- click on own castles to upgrade them</p>\n<p>- click on enemy castles to attack</p>\n<p>- click on chest to retrieve it</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>- if the army is on march, it will consume gold. Also, only one army from one castle can be on the march at once (a castle cannot send two armies)</p>\n<p>- make sure you have defense.</p>\n<p>- armies cannot attack each other on the map (they are stupid like that)</p>\n<p>- gold is the only resource that can be below 0</p>\n<p>- to conquer a castle, you need to get its defense to 0 (if yours gets to 0, it is also conquered). The army that conquers the castle becomes the defense.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<p>- AI is stupid</p>\n<p>- chests sometimes spawn outside the game area and sometimes it is visible when the code moves them inside the playing area.</p>\n<p>- it is really hard to conquer other castles, but it is possible... somehow...\u00a0 FIXED</p>\n<p>- the attacking/defending needs a bit more work.\u00a0FIXED?</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in 3 days.
