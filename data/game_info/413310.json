They may or may not have been destined to meet each other... who knows!? But they are here to do one thing... find out what is causing the massive NAViant invasion, and figure out how to stop it... I guess that's two things. Hmm. Anyways, Nok, with the help of his new found friend No-e, must traverse the great sea of information that is the Internet to find the fabled Alpha0.def, the only key to stopping the onslaught unleashed by the shadowy entity known only as, MaliciOS.</p>\n\n<p>Nok and No-e exist in a beautiful, handcrafted, cybernetic world. Everyday brings new challenges because we're always hard at work developing the game and all its amazing, fully customized assets. We could just use asset store bundles to build a cookie-cutter gaming experience, but we think you deserve so much more! We are currently working on developing the public demo of the game, which coincidentally, is also the game's first level. Development of the demo is approximately 40% completed (not including story-line specific elements) and the 7th version of the demo is currently available to play for free!... for everyone!</p>\n<p>No story-line aspects have been incorporated just yet, but fully animated, sequenced, and voiced cut-scenes and story elements are on the way, and when the game is complete it will boast a fully narrated branching story, multiple skill trees, and tons of other immersive aspects. The project is very ambitious for a lowly indie game developer, but with your support we can focus on development and provide you the best quality gaming experience!</p>\n<p>In the very near future we'll be incorporating new systems into the game-play experience such as achievements, collectors cards, special abilities and skill trees, and so much more, so stay tuned!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T02:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/710/710e08fea85642404735e6a7c566b086.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["McCoonna"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
