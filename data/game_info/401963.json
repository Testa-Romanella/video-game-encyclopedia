Gather information, exploit weaknesses, and steal the magical artifact keeping the evil Dead King \"alive\".</p>\n<p>Your primary tools in this endeavor are a pair of daggers that can be enchanted with runes found throughout the city. They can then be left in strategic locations and activated from afar to provide reconnaissance, distract enemies, allow for a quick getaway, and more.</p>\n<p>As Spelldagger is currently in active development, feedback and constructive criticism is welcome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:02:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99a/99acc51f22b8e33ffa7828c07bdbbc60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DWMcDonald"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
