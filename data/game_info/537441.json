With such a limited timeframe, I learned it's important to focus on the essentials, and to not get too fancy. Now keep in mind, the game is a bit buggy, but hopefully you enjoy it nonetheless!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T04:26:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b2/9b2c58dc33aa138ce636a4c1bded2605.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HalfBolt Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
