In this sprint I have included a functional clock. The user now has the option of scaling the size of the objects that they want to create. The user also has the option of setting a predetermined value for deleting objects. Finally, the user can experience new functionality on the objects created, like the brightness of the colors or transparency and the clearing of objects now has a bit of animation.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T06:07:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b74f1bdd651f674c98e0502308e9b6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["manuelavila"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
