Earlier this month (June 2021) marked the ten year anniversary of my Scratch account, so I decided to continue this series outside of Scratch.</p>\n<p>The appeal of the first two Rainbow Festival games (to me) is the absurd amount of frustratingly bad design. The games are fun because they aren't fun. When you get hit by an obstacle, instead of dying, you experience a fate worse than death: knock-back. Many levels rely on getting lucky with random spawns and behavior.<br/></p>\n<p>I decided to take these terrible ideas and expand upon them in the third game. On top of including intentionally annoying mechanics, I filled the entire game with inside jokes and references that only a couple people will actually understand.</p>\n<p>Oh, there are also a few major secrets.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:13:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be8/be82ce04fc587b035ba34f32e1303f46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DecadeDecaf"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
