These computers are maintained by small machines known as Wisps and protected by massive and fearsome machines called Wyverns. Though the people of this world do not know why or by what these computers were built, they have learned to coexist with them.</p>\n<p>One of these cities is Sol-Itar, home to the private investigator Ted Holdum. One night Ted finds himself called in by the police to look into a murder, and learns there might be more to the murder than it seems...</p>\n<p>An adventure game made for a Game World Creation class. The idea was that we as a class created a world, then groups created cities in that world, and then everybody made a game taking place in one of the cities. My group ended up going with a card theme for our city, as should be obvious.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/106/106471232995db94af768d0fcf074553.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thedobaga"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
