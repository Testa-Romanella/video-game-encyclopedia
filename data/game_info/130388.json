The game\r\nwas created from scratch and entirely by me in less than 48 hours.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYour objective is to find treasures in the cave while avoiding and killing an\r\nimmense amount of living jelly. Caves are randomly generated and are harder\r\nthe deeper they are. They have various levels (potentially infinite) and contain\r\na number of chests.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe main obstacle of the game are jelly monsters. By digging around the map, you\r\nget rocks that can later be thrown at these monsters to kill them. There's not\r\nmuch more to the game, though.\r\n</p>Controls\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tKey\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAction\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u2190\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMoves the player left\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u2192\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMoves the player right\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u2191\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMoves the player up\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\u2192\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tMoves the player down\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tV\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDigs dirt diractly in fron of you\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tC\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tOpens a chest directly in fron of you\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tX\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tShoots a rock previously dig", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/144/144e3621b57543decfe3419c22f2dbb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Daniel Escoz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
