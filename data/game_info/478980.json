The theme of Rewind, has led to a very interesting, but frustrating at times, mechanic. The player has the ability to Rewind the motion of any revolving obstacle, but there's a catch.</p>\n<p>This, along with slime, lava and lasers leads to a fun game that will make you mad...probably.</p>\n<p>If the pre-made levels weren't enough there is also a level maker in the game, where you can Design, Play and Share custom levels.</p>\n<p>I've attached a level 'Custom' that i made earlier using the editor. Download it, place it into your save folder (directory below) and click load in the editor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>C:\\Users\\'name'\\AppData\\Local\\SubmitRewind\\Saved\\SaveGames<br/></p>\n<p>This folder 'SaveGames' will only exist if you have saved a level in the editor yourself, if you will not save your own level but would still like to play the custom level attached you can just create the folder in the correct file location.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c50e45d07f3ed58dc105a358ac0cd91a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DomCripps"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
