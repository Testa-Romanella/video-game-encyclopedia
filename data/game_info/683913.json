But the initial testers review is 'It's hard to read and even confusing', which make them not properly go through the tutorial. The A/R and H/K look the really similar in game. It's specially bad if you misunderstand 'A' with 'R', as 'A' 'D' &amp; 'C' are the only keyboard keys used in game for controls. I can update the build, but since it's for a Jam, I don't want to change the initial build till the judging is over.\" - 24, Oct, 21\u00a0 - 19:34</p>\n<p>*Credits for the assets used are in game folder*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T06:35:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c42580110dcaf34bc074efd33fd79b70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Utkarsh Raizada"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
