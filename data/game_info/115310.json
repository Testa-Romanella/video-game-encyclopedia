It first saw the light of day in August 2013, when I released an early version of the ship editor as a \"tech demo.\" Since then, I have been developing and expanding it. Though it is still far from complete, it has come a long way since that initial version.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tShipyard is a turn-based strategy game in a science fiction universe. The core mechanic is the ability to build your spaceship from individual systems. Combat revolves around strategically destroying enemy systems to hamper its ability to fight back while you wear down its structural integrity. The world is randomly generated and, though thinly populated at the moment, I have plans to fill it with NPC ships and stations, asteroids to mine, planets to explore, and all that good stuff.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Main Website:</strong> Shipyard on Brass Watch Games\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/946/946f5a48f581a7341a347e34c2060586.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Brass Watch Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
