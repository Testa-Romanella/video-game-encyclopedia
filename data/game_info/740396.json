{"id": 740396, "slug": "eightbitoids", "name": "Eightbitoids", "name_original": "Eightbitoids", "description": "<p>I built this game in GameMaker Studio 2 as a birthday gift for my nephew who has an interest in retro gaming. I wanted to make something for him that I played as a kid in the 80s so Asteroids from the Atari 2600 was an easy choice. I've tried to be as true to the original as possible because I wanted it to feel like an old game but make it more accessible than the original. I've provided a menu to select game modes similar to the original game (there were 66 of them, selected only by a physical hardware switch on the console itself.) The score can roll over just like the original - the max is 99999 which could be stored in 2 and a half 8-bit bytes and the maximum extra ships is 9, which took up the other half byte. The enemies are mindless but surprisingly deadly.</p>\n<p>I really hope you enjoy this game, I\u00a0had a ton of fun building it!</p>\n<p>Stephan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T07:17:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69b/69b41c27bb18dcb149a62ae9588c6087.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["srcleaves"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
