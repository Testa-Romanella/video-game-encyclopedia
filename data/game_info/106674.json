Filling a row across the playing field that is parallel to the bottom will clear the row and score you major points. You advance a level for every 10 lines you clear and the pieces fall faster. The game supports Xbox 360 controllers and most other controllers for up to three players.</p><p>\r\n\tI really would like to know what you think about it.
