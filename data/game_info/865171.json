It is your goal to kill all the slimes and travel between the different levels of the lab.</p>\n<p>You can collect slime coins where you can buy weapons, ammo and hp with to get further in the lab.</p>\n<p><strong>Note<br/></strong>This is the first game I made by my self. I made every thing myself except the music and sound effects.\u00a0I gave my self around a month to finish this project and worked on it during my free time. I had to cut some content to finish it in the time frame so it could feel a little bit shallow/empty. I might work on it in the future but for now I find it enjoy able enough to play for a few minutes.</p>\n<p>I hope you guys enjoy it and if you have any feedback feel free to comment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T07:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53f/53f27c6e3339a349f45a1cf07a4b4140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cody-Bolleboom"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
