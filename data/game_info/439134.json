{"id": 439134, "slug": "lsd-revamped", "name": "LSD: Revamped", "name_original": "LSD: Revamped", "description": "<p>LSD: Revamped is a fan-made remake of the cult-classic PS1 game LSD: Dream Emulator.</p>\n<p>LSD is an exploration game where the player explores surreal dreamscapes without any objectives. The dreams in the game are based on a dream diary that was kept for ten years. Originally created by Japanese artist Osamu Sato, the game was intended to be unlike any other game available at the time.</p>\n<p>LSD: Revamped aims to make LSD playable on modern hardware whilst retaining the look and feel of the original game. It adds a number of optional quality-of-life enhancements such as customisable control schemes, increased resolutions, and a better framerate.</p>\n<p>The game is still in development, and is lacking a large portion of content. This release is an 'early access' release, and there are four more updates planned. The contents of these updates can be found by visiting the website (lsdrevamped.net). The biggest thing planned to be added is support for player-created content (mods). This will allow players to add their own dreams, music, textures, and objects.</p>\n<p>If you experience any bugs/issues with the game, please report them in an email to bugreports@lsdrevamped.net. Please attach the game's log file when reporting an issue, it can be found at:<br/>C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Figglewatts\\LSDR\\output_log.txt<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T04:09:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2b/a2b0104394eb4666493d4c1c26f1717c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Figglewatts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
