I never could have guessed its release would change the entire direction of my life. It&#39;s success (however minor it may seem to others) has enabled me to spend more time learning about games as well as recently allowed me to make games full time as my profession. My younger self would not believe it. I have been provided with so many amazing opportunities (I couldn&#39;t possibly describe them all here) and I couldn&#39;t have done the majority of this without the great support of the community that appeared out of nowhere to play my silly little arcade games. I thank you all.Super Bit Blaster XL is the next evolution of my original Steam game. In the last few years since it&#39;s release I have learned a lot more about Unity and C#. Using this I have reworked many aspects of the game. I added a new Co-Op mode, Vs Mode, improved the GFX, new translations, new ships, new powers, and new Easter eggs. I also completely overhauled the control scheme due to feedback; while it&#39;s still not a Twin-Stick shooter, overall control is so much more responsive.My decision to release this as a separate title as opposed to an update on the original is mostly because the changes are all so drastic I wouldn&#39;t want to upset the flow of the original Steam game that people seem to love. I also have learned a lot from (fellow) developers about self worth so the price will be higher than a single dollar this time around. i&#39;m sure there will be folks keen to pick apart this decision as greedy or selfish but I imagine the people that really enjoyed the original and want to support creators will understand my choices. If you&#39;re still interested please remember it&#39;s very important to ADD IT TO YOUR STEAM WISHLIST.I greatly appreciate your feedback and will do my best to ensure lengthy support for my games. Please contact me through Twitter, My Website, Nickervision Studios Discord, or the forums if you want to discuss an issue with the game, something misleading on the store page, or you just want to say hello.Thank you for taking a moment to read this<br />\nAdam Nickerson - Nickervision StudiosGAMEPLAY:Your ship can not stop moving; so you must turn and use your boost/brake to keep from crashing into an ever increasing amount of enemies and obstacles<br />\nYour ship is always shooting, so make sure to pick up more ammo and the wide variety of awesome power ups, pick ups and boosts to help you survive longer<br />\nGet the highest score you can while collecting coins to buy more ships that are faster, shoot faster, or have more shieldsFEATURES:A throwback to the classic quarter eating arcade games of the 80&#39;s.
