I personally added the music, sound effects, and additional features such as the ability to regain life by catching hearts as well as adding a level of\u00a0difficulty\u00a0by increasing the candy spawn rate as you cross certain score thresholds. Thank you for playing!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Updated 11/2/22 - Added toggle to allow player to use their mouse to control the monster. Also increased the candy spawn rate when using the mouse to offset the decrease in difficulty.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Raja with Charger Games!
