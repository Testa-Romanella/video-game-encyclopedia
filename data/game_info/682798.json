Each animal has a characteristic type of movement. Figure out as quickly as you can how to avoid them!</p>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tThe bats simply fly around. Grandma dislikes them for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tThe spiders hide quietly in the dark. But they won't miss any opportunity to bite someone.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tThe snakes wander around aimlessly, getting in everyone's way.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tJellyfishes are armed with stinging tentacles. Fortunately, they live under water\u2026\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tSea urchins don't move too much, but can push themselves with their spines. on't get too close to them!\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tGrandma used to tell stories about the beligerant tribe of Pantojos\u2026 but it's been a long time since the last Pantojo was seen ashore in Stevedore's town.<br/>Nowadays, nobody remembers where their island is.\r\n\r\n<p>And, as grandma says, \"think before you act\". There is no time limit, so carefully plan your movements in advance.
