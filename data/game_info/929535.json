One day, you hear that old-fashioned music of danger and understand that <strong>you won't survive without shelter</strong>.\u00a0 That's why you decided to build a shelter.</p>\n<p><strong>Building shelters is progress</strong>, for you and for your enemies. Maybe, they can destroy your camp or even metal bunker, but <strong>the end of each shelter is a beginning for a new one </strong>that will be even stronger. That's because you create new instruments with each new shelter and can loot new resources to build a better shelter!</p>\n<p><strong>Survive your enemies! Proof that you are the Unbreakable! Even a massive missile attack won't stop you!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>!PLEASE, READ BEFORE PLAYING!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was created during a 7-day long game jam by me alone.\u00a0 Unfortunately, there are <strong>some severe bugs</strong> that you can face during your game experience:<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol><li><strong>The game closes after pressing Start or Restart button. </strong> Somehow, the game chooses the exit button instead of the play button when you want to launch the main game. Consider it as an easter egg to the game jam's theme :)</li><li><strong>Eaten by tiger right after the start. </strong>Sometimes the first enemy can attack you immediately after launching the game. It is also an unintended easter egg :)</li><li><strong>Cannot interact with sources and resources. </strong> Sometimes you can't interact with trees, rocks, and resources from them. Try to loot another resource and return to it later to save time. It's a collision problem that I didn't manage to fix.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Have fun</strong> and don't forget to rate my game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T10:54:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6e/b6ebcf1c5c7e8dfaeb8e715ec421e24c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Verianno"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
