What I propose is a classic rpg created\r\nwith Rpg maker and a classic plot: the game starts \"in medias\r\nres\", the world was cursed years ago, nobody can read and it's\r\ndifficult for normal people to use their sight.\r\nYou are a guy named See (what a fantasy) who is the new Sight.\r\nThe legend of the Sight is the fulcrum of the story, no one knows\r\nit perfectly, but everyone recognizes you just by looking\r\nat you. Explore continents, do some quests, make friends and\r\nenemy, look for the statues, find out what the legend really\r\nmeans and try to save the world from its darkness.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T08:59:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a53/a53ca68ac6c0a8a9ca6069c1dcd4a3bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Velios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
