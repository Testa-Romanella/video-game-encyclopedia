I see you have stumbled upon my game,\u00a0<strong>Le' Cat Game</strong>. Well, I suppose I should fill you in! A young cat called\u00a0<em>Mow\u00a0</em>stumbled into a small section of the Wailing Forest. A large pack of vicious Dobermans live there, and they thrive on mice, rats and rabbits. That is the reason for Mow to stumble to the forest. Her owners fed her, but she is still hungry. The dogs smell her, and each try to bite her. On her way, however, she collects some rats to eat.</p>\n<p>The controls to this game are the arrows on the left of your keyboard; up down, left and right keys control Mow. try to catch the rats, and don't go near the Dobermans. If you see a person in a blue suit, and a blue hat, carrying a net, she's the pet control. Go to her to capture the dogs, and help you on your endless hunt for food. The shields are bright blue with a yellow dot in the middle. When the shield is activated, Mow will have a blue circle surrounding her. Every rat you eat will earn you two points. A red heart will give you another life.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Have fun!</em></strong>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8a2fb40514ae93437f67aa4ddc1b006.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maker School"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
