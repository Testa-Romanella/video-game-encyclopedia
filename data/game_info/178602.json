Works best on touch devices. Refresh to get some different faces for your creature (there's not a ton of variety yet, but it's there). You have to perpetually pet it and take care of it. It kind of... doesn't get better. Prototype for something else, maybe tamagotchi-ish!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b92/b92c73830d1e8f4f5261776cedf377a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kim Hoang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
