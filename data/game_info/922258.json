{"id": 922258, "slug": "helmet-point", "name": "Helmet Point", "name_original": "Helmet Point", "description": "<p>Helmet Point is a short 3-level platformer.</p>\n<p>Sir Lancelot is one of the most valiant knights in the kingdom. However, in one of his many battles, his helmet is enchanted by a witch. The helmet, now blessed with life, decides he is tired of being left out of adventuring and being dismissed as a mere piece of armor. He leaves to explore the world.</p>\n<p>In the game, you will head through three pretty difficult levels. There are power-ups, such as the Power Ore, a rainbow piece of metal that grants extreme power for a short time, and the HELLmet, which breaks reality and makes the game harder.</p>\n<p>This game was made for My First Game Jam: Winter 2023. I had a lot of fun making it. I would like to thank lexaloffle for creating\u00a0PICO-8, which is what this game is programmed in. This game may\u00a0be hard, but do not fear. You can do it.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that this is a beta of the game and may have glitches and bugs. If you find any please tell me. Once the game jam is over I will put the source code for sale on this page for $2+, so that if you like the game you can create your own levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T05:08:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f11/f11fd06f1ebb5470dea476532a6edd83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mcniner"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
