{"id": 7016, "slug": "jack-lumber", "name": "Jack Lumber", "name_original": "Jack Lumber", "description": "<p>Lumber Jack is an indie game about a crazy lumberjack who hates the trees and tries to destroy all of them. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>A tree killed Lumber Jack&#39;s granny, and he is furious and desires revenge. The protagonist uses his supernatural powers to massacre the whole forest. The player&#39;s aim is not only to destroy the trees but also to solve skill and logic puzzles.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay is all about cutting up pieces of lumber. The player has to cut them up in a certain way and as fast as possible - thus he can gain enough points. Lumber Jack lives in a rather mysterious and odd world where strange things occur. He can drink Granny&#39;s magical syrups to improve his log-chopping powers, collects beards, shelters the forest animals in his cabin after destroying their forest homes - they appear at the end of each level. There is a pun telling beaver which talks to Lumber Jack; other animals make some cute noises. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The player can unlock Infinitree Mode which requires chopping as many trees as possible. There are also game challenges centered around certain missions; for instance, the player must build up a stockpile of wood, which is used as a store to buy beards, pictures, and buffs (they allow to make mistakes and fix them).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/040/040edf3ba14f361d40d5cec5949c8da5.jpeg", "website": "http://jacklumbergame.com", "rating": 2.04, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 33, "owned": 687, "beaten": 4, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 26, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 26, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS", "Android", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Owlchemy Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Owlchemy Labs"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
