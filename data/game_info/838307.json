Academy, a once-renowned magic academy of centuries ago, is currently declining. You are a boy who left the human realm with his best friend to go to this academy in the magical realm because you are the first man in history with the talent to perform magic. The magical realm is a mystic land with many new experiences for you, and full of girls without the slightest idea of what a &quot;man&quot; is. However, upon arrival at the academy, the lack of teachers, students, or any glorious magic is painfully evident. With only a director, a nurse, and a teacher, the academy makes every effort it can to get its footing and be able to teach magic as it is said it once was. But today, in the magical realm, no one is interested in magic. It is considered now to be old-fashioned and wild. However, you will be the help the academy needs; together with the director Maeve, you will be able to gather students, equipment, magic, magical objects, and teachers to return magic to its former glory.\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-26T21:35:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47c/47cd035afcfd481f631a1fe6f6dbb01e.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/hatchetgames", "rating": 4.26, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 43, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 20, "dropped": 1, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 25, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 27, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
