After your most recent listicle flopping, you're on the hunt for the next big Christmas hit, and it just so happens to land you in your hometown of Harkmall, Massachusetts, aka everyone's mental image of a Christmas village. From \"there's only one bed\"\u00a0to getting into sexy snowball fights, Harkmall is rife with Christmas cliches that'll make you think, \"hey, is this an affectionate parody of a certain franchise of Christmas movies?\"</p>\n\r\nCharacters\r\n<p><strong>Rowan (name and appearance changeable):\u00a0</strong>The main character and a native of Harkmall.</p>\n<p><strong>Monica:\u00a0</strong>Your senior at Buzzread. She's rather blunt and to the point, but has a heart when it counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Charlie:\u00a0</strong>Your childhood friend and a native from Harkmall. His family owns the bakery in town, and he's just as sweet as the things they sell.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Art/UI:\u00a0</strong>Rui Jin</p>\n<p><strong>Narrative:\u00a0</strong>Adam Lemos<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Coding:\u00a0</strong>Kristen Marcinek<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T06:01:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b3/4b30d60d132c8f15398730f55688f8a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["starishsky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
