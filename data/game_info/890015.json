The goal of the game is to convey the loss of agency and control of the protagonist through the years to the player. Towards the end of the story people who depend on Maryam to rise up and push through help her to regain her agency and take back freedom for everyone.  \t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>The bottom of the screen will display the actions that the player can do and the corresponding keyboard keys. As time goes by and the protagonist interacts with the oppressors (Mullahs, Morality Police, Fundamentalists, etc) they literally take those keys away and they disappear from the screen. So the player will lose the ability to move right, left and jump.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T04:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1b/c1b04d7b841117725cd1f57511b69d09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Barax"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
