It is a simple manifestation of my daydreams in which I would be in\u00a0 the place of Cloud Kitty, floating through pink clouds, far away from everything on the ground and enjoying the serenity of solitude. Now, Cloud Kitty can be a stand in for each person that plays, allowing them freedom and peace of mind, even if only for a brief moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is inspired by the prime days of GirlsGoGames.com and the Mattel Barbie games. Most of which are still functioning to this day. With slightly more complex game state implementation using a state machine script, spawn/destroy rules\u00a0and scroll, pair and collision logic.</p>\n<p>Simply use the SPACEBAR to move Cloud Kitty through the pink clouds and prevent her from crashing into them! :)</p><p>Gameplay Preview:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T19:53:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/265/265ca2f9014ba4a44c763c753442d3e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ella Osho <3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
