Continuation War: the Reds return with a total strength of 1,500,000 - almost half of the entire Finnish population - and the Finns stop them again. Finland\u2019s survival in these two brutal wars against an enemy so vast was a true historical miracle. A miracle of heroism and valor. A miracle of the Finnish spirit of liberty.<br/><br/><h3>Immerse yourself into the (hi)story-driven gameplay</h3><strong>Primary and secondary objectives</strong><br/>Complete numerous objectives grounded in history and narrated by a number of historical characters.<br/><br/><strong>Faithfully recreated historical units</strong><br/>Command the Finnish ski troops and captured Soviet vehicles, including BT-7, T-34, and KV tanks. Purchase German Pz-IV tanks, StuG assault guns, and Ju-88 bombers. Make use of pre-war British Bristol Blenheim bombers, covered by Dutch Fokker and US Buffalo fighter planes.<br/><br/><strong>Upgrade your units to newer models</strong><br/>Make sure your forces are always up to date and up to the task. New models become available at historically accurate points in time.<br/><br/><h3>Train your troops and choose equipment</h3><br/><strong>Gain combat experience</strong><br/>Choose various skills for your men as they gain combat experience. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Combine units from different classes</strong><br/>Compose your own force from ten classes available: Infantry, Artillery, Tanks, Reconnaissance units, Assault guns, Armored trains, Anti-tank guns, Anti-aircraft guns, Fighters, and Tactical bombers. Utilize their unique skills and equipment to maximum effect.  <br/><br/><strong>Acquire diverse equipment</strong><br/>Equip units with various special equipment, such as Machine guns, Mortars, Smoke grenades, Anti-tank rifles and Molotov cocktails, Winter equipment, and many more.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Use transport vehicles</strong><br/>In the harsh Finnish winter, speed may be the difference between life and death. Provide your units with vehicles to improve their mobility, or have your Infantry use skis to outmaneuver the enemy in winter operations.<h3>Use elaborate combat mechanics to overcome any foe</h3><strong>Manage Lethal vs Nonlethal damage</strong><br/>There are two types of damage: lethal and nonlethal. Dealing nonlethal damage to your enemies will make them surrender. Different units are prone to deal either lethal or nonlethal. <br/><br/><strong>Use terrain differences to your advantage</strong><br/>Tanks are vulnerable in difficult terrain and cities, while Infantry can occupy buildings or hide in the forests to gain large defensive bonuses. All units suffer large penalties in swamps or while crossing a river, etc. Be aware of your surroundings, and use them to your advantage.<br/><br/><strong>Take the \u201cline of sight\u201d and the \u201czone of control\u201d into consideration</strong><br/>Some terrain and buildings obstruct firing unless you are using artillery or mortars. Approaching an enemy unit up close will finish your movement, unless you are using a Recon unit.<br/><br/><strong>Activate various skills and equipment</strong><br/>Use incendiary or subcaliber shells to maximize your damage to the enemy. Order forced march in the most desperate situations. Employ aerobatics to increase your air force efficiency. Use your HQ skills to affect the entire battlefield.<br/><br/><strong>Use a complex spotting system that represents the importance of reconnaissance</strong><br/>Call upon the air and ground reconnaissance to gather intel about the enemy before ordering your troops forward. No one likes to be ambushed. <br/><br/><strong>Adapt to various battlefield conditions</strong><br/>There is a day-night cycle in the game as well as weather types such as frost or rain. All of these conditions impose penalties that must be countered with special equipment and skills. The finest of your troops may even use such conditions to their advantage. Use the cover of the night to sneak up on the enemy, or strike when the foe is freezing and immobilized.<h3>Utilize the most advanced supply and infrastructure system in the genre</h3><br/><strong>Ammunition and fuel</strong><br/>All units have limited ammo and fuel. Without ammo, your units cannot fight, and without fuel, your vehicles cannot move - and any aircraft will simply crash. <br/><br/><strong>Supply hubs</strong><br/>Generate supplies and transfer them to your troops throughout an entire system, like a heart pumping blood through veins.<br/><br/><strong>Supply points </strong><br/>Connect different infrastructure facilities and redistribute supplies. Supply points also allow your troops to change special equipment and renew its charges.<br/><br/><strong>Airfield </strong><br/>Allows aircraft units to land for refueling, repairs, and refit of equipment. Damage to the airfield would also damage all landed aircraft.<br/><br/><strong>Seaport</strong><br/>Allows resupply and change of equipment for naval units. It also generates supplies, if there is a maritime hub nearby and the Seaport is not under enemy blockade.<br/><br/><strong>Damage the infrastructure</strong><br/>All infrastructure facilities can be disabled if their HP drops to 50% or lower. It will then gradually regain its HP and its functionality. Strike at the enemy facilities to prevent them from resupplying.<br/><br/><strong>Cut off the enemy supply lines</strong><br/>All infrastructure facilities are considered connected if a simple truck vehicle could move between them in one go. If you put your unit between the enemy facilities, it would create a zone of control, and prevent the enemy from transferring supplies. Leave the enemy units without much needed ammunition and fuel, then hunt them down.<br/><br/><strong>Make sure your own units are supplied</strong><br/>There is a limit to how far your supply vehicles can deliver supplies - make sure you take that into account when planning your next offensive.Enjoy the Prologue and make sure to wishlist <strong>Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty - the full game</strong> today!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-31T06:22:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58f/58f450b612492547625a9b45a95ba707.jpg", "website": "http://starnigames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 33, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 578, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Starni Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Hyperstrange"], "esrb_rating": null}
