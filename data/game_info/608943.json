The girl moves and interacts with objects as point&amp;click while playing with the Shado is a real platform game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another feature of the game is that all art and animations are hand-drawn making it look like an animation film.</p>\n<p>This project is my solo project for my final project at the university.</p>\n<p>At the moment, the full version of the game is still in development and at the moment there are only two levels available.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Therefore, I would be very grateful for your feedback, comments, recommendations and possible ideas.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T05:46:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f58/f58c495b83141bd9f34b71b13accf352.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Elizaveta Socican"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
