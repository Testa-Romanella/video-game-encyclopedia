This is Dichemy, a GMTK Game Jam 2022 Submission!</p>\n<p>The theme this year is \"Roll of the Dice\". The name is a combination of the theme with the game's tenuous alchemical flavor.</p>\n<p>In Dichemy, you find a magic dice that grants you access to a special ability - but only one at a time!</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of the jam, this is a prototype game, probably closest to a platformer of some kind. You see it being adapted to a metroidvania or similar, perhaps. There are definitely some movement quirks I haven't ironed out yet, so sorry about those.</p>\n<p>See if you can locate the (not all that) hidden garden!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Shift to swing sword, or whatever that is</li><li>E to shoot fireballs</li><li>Q to activate shield<br/>\n</li><li>R to get a better ability</li><li>Esc to exit level</li><li>Nothing to sit and vibe to the music</li></ul>\n<p>Made with:</p>\n<ul><li>Engine: Godot (First time using Godot outside of a tutorial for me! It's been great!)</li><li>Art: Asesprite</li><li>Music:\u00a0Logic Pro</li><li>Sound Effect:\u00a0Audacity</li></ul>\n<p>The font\u00a0used is from here:\u00a0https://managore.itch.io/m5x7!\u00a0All other art,\u00a0code, and sound was made by me (hambones)\u00a0with the help of these tools within the 48 hour period.</p>\n<p>First game jam!
