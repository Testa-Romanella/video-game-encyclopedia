It's also a sequel to my previous WNG jam title, Entropy of Royalty. Unlike the first game, which was more about creating narrative through gameplay, this game is more about just telling a particular narrative alongside gameplay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Narrative Restriction: Anagnorisis</p>\n<p>Gameplay Restriction: No Text/150 Words of Text at maximum</p>\n<p>Optional theme: House Under the Stairs<br/>- I decided to apply this theme to the setting of the game: an underground thief hideout. Of course, because of the nature of the artwork, that isn't exactly... evident.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To be frank, this game was a pain in the ass to make, and I'm not really enthused with the result. It works, and I think the narrative is solid enough, but it feels like the least interesting narrative game I've made so far. Of course, I'm open to any and all feedback that anyone has! <br/></p>\n<p>--Toaster Strooder, lowly merchant of the Wheat Guild<br/></p><p>P.S.
