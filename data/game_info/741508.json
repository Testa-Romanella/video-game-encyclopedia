The player guides a single character deep into a subterranean complex to retrieve the Orb of Zot, fending off many horrible and hideous creatures along the way. Once retrieved, the player must return both character and Orb safely to the surface world. Easier said than done, but fun all the same.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T19:23:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec3/ec3446909a50b7c6069e8b89db86bec6.jpg", "website": "http://www.dungeoncrawl.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
