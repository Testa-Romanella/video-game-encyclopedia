I also like to make arcade-like games that are easy to pick up and gets you right into action with just a few keystrokes.<br/><br/>It is also hard to find a flight sim where dogfights are as fun as watching a Su-35 doing a cobra or watching the movie Stealth.<br/><br/>And that is what I'm trying to do with <strong>Afteburn</strong>: super quick arcade air combat. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de5/de56687c6c355333068fa91c055ae71e.jpg", "website": "http://morfeodev.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 17, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MorfeoDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MorfeoDev"], "esrb_rating": null}
