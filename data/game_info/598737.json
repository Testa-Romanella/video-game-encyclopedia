You're simply a teen hoping to enjoy what little of his life he can with his friends,\u00a0before he's old enough to start living like an adult.\u00a0 So, near the end of the year, you call your friends to have one last outing together before the next year starts. It's a great chance to try out a new event coming out that day, where a new type of VR is finally released to the world! The best part? It's dirt cheap to attend! Somethings doesn't feel entirely right though...</p>\n<p><strong>Error 0: New World found</strong>, or\u00a0<strong>Error 0: N.W.F</strong>, is a gay furry fantasy visual novel with sci-fi elements that has three romanceable characters. At the moment, it is only a very short demo rife with issues, but I hope to improve it as much as I can over the course of Error 0's development. So to this end, please give me any criticism you have, and if you want to give me any help I'll be glad to accept it.</p>\n<p>Most everything was done by me, Apropos;</p>\n<p>The coding/sprites/writing/story idea\u00a0are mine, art was drawn on computer with mouse.</p>\n<p>Backgrounds (With one or two exceptions made by me) were plucked from the internet and edited.</p>\n<p>Music was done by\u00a0Kevin MacLeod and\u00a0downloaded from here:\u00a0Royalty Free Music (incompetech.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T09:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59b/59b8fb0158ce311ed75180b3182e7507.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Apropos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
