If you reach the end and have not collected all 16 strawberries the level will not reset. You must collect all 16 strawberries for the timer to stop and the level to restart to play again.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Let me know your quickest time in the comments!\u00a0Would like to see some videos of some people speed running the level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>AD or Arrow Keys to move around<br/></p>\n<p>W, Space, Up Arrow Key to jump<br/></p>\n<p>S, CTRL, Down Arrow Key to walk slowly</p>\n<p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>\n<p>The game is very difficult and it's made like this on purpose once you die the level resets and you must start from the very beginning of the game.
