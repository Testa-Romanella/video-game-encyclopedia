The main protagonist, Nicole, discovers her magical abilities and falls deeply in love with a simple guy from the neighboring town.<br/><br/>As a natural cataclysm divides the Empire into two parts, enmity erupts between the peoples, and the heroes find themselves on opposite sides. The rift in the universe echoes the rift in Nicole's heart. She realizes that she will never see her beloved again. Or will she have a chance to turn back time? Is it worth chasing the initial feelings, sacrificing the destinies of her loved ones, or accept her fate?<br/><br/><br/>The karma system allows players to accumulate or decrease the parameter based on the moral choices, leading to different endings.
