There are no action, shooting, silly screamers here. This game is all about relaxation, peace, enjoying the nature, its sounds and realistic environment. The game uses the latest Unreal Engine 4, which makes graphics and lightning look super realistic. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main gameplay is based on a simple task \u2013 to collect the necessary amount of firewood before the nightfall, while keeping the fire from going out. All these conditions are pushing you to manage the time correctly. Each time the firewood will be located in different places, that brings some variety to every attempt.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T03:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43b/43b217a9e2890c5e3fb5781654323744.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pickle Drugs"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pickle Drugs"], "esrb_rating": null}
