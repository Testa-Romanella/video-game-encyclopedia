You are training in a simulation program to improve your pilot skills.</p>\n\n<p>Notes: If the web version fps is too low, you may want to try the windows version.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the complete version of the game, the complete version has a upgrade system.\u00a0Some how the web and windows build suffer the same bug which does not happen in Editor, I cannot fix that\u00a0on time. So I change the game a little bit(all upgrades unlock, lower wave count, more enemies per waves, player have more HP)\u00a0to exclude the upgrade system. Hopefully I can fix this within the next few days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T09:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1d/d1dc2f405680edb702efc81fe1dee543.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["alexy369"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
