Unfortunately you were one of those contestants. You have to outrun the cheese otherwise it will consume you as it does with everything in its path.</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to keep your balance while rushing down-hill and don't forget to trip other people on your way down. Losing balance and tumbling is not the end of the world but do it enough times and the Cheese Wheel of Doom will catch up and consume you. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Creators:<br/>Flippo - Twitter, itch.io<br/>BenJoe - Twitter, itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:37:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6f/f6fe6a1c2c7c1710a3ab22ecb2e13a44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenJoe72", "Flippo13"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
