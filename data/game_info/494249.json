Just like in real life though, wait too long and you can lose it all.</p>\n<p>How To Play:</p>\n<p>On each level, there are 5 meters that have the potential to yield 10 points each. At each meter, wait for the indicator to go up and then press Space to lock in the number.\u00a0 If your score meets the level's goal, you move on to the next level.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was built for the Low Effort Jam 2. It runs in the Godot engine with about 150 lines of code and home-made graphics in about 4 low-effort hours in total.  It was fun - hope you enjoy the outcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T04:04:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42d/42d96ff6ba4e1d9f725764498b7f5560.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["wrong.dog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
