{"id": 732507, "slug": "guardian-of-paradise", "name": "Guardian of Paradise", "name_original": "Guardian of Paradise", "description": "<p>&quot;Guardian of Paradise&quot; is an excellent action-orientated &quot;Zelda&quot;-like RPG. You play a young boy called Tela whose sister is suffering from a mysterious illness. So Tela sets out on his quest to find the healing waters of the legendary place called Paradise.</p>\n<p>On his way, he makes friendship with the five elemental spirits (fire, water, earth, air, and darkness) who teach him spells and join him on his way. But he can only summon one elemental at a time (by killing enemies and collecting the colored coins they leave behind), so there is just a limited amount of different spells you can use, before slaying another enemy and collecting the coins of a different color.</p>\n<p>This idea of combining the abilities and magical skills of the different spirits to reach your goal is the basis for all the puzzles in the game. And sometimes you really have to use your brain to find the right solution.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-03T23:36:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dc/8dc170eb17270ba96776151238abf9b0.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/Guardian_of_Paradise", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["E.
