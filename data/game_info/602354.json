{"id": 602354, "slug": "scramble-battle-of-britain", "name": "Scramble: Battle of Britain", "name_original": "Scramble: Battle of Britain", "description": "Scramble: Battle of Britain is a simultaneous turn-based dogfighting game. Set in a 3D airspace, the game features fast-paced, tactical combat with dynamic flight physics. Luftwaffe and RAF fighter squadrons go head-to-head over The English Channel. Competing players simultaneously issue control inputs for multiple aircraft while time is paused. The planned orders are then played out simultaneously: shots are fired, loops are looped, colliding planes collide.\n<br/><br/>\nEach turn is divided into three phases: planning phase, action phase, and review phase. Survey the aerial battlefield, plan your flight paths, execute spectacular manoeuvres, scrub through time to assess battle damage, and defeat your enemies through masterful tactics and captivating aerobatics.\n\n<br/>\nPLAN YOUR FLIGHT PATH\nThe two squadrons simultaneously set input controls for each of their Aircraft, adjusting their flight path and attempting to bring them into attacking positions. Setting the flightpaths works like flying planes in a real-time combat game: you're not choosing from set manoeuvres or levels of altitude, you're adjusting pitch, roll, yaw and throttle to create your path.\n<br/>\nThe Planning Phase is time-limited: you need to think fast and act quickly. \n<br/>\nEXECUTE YOUR ACTIONS\nTime is unpaused and your planned actions are played out. All aircraft move and shoot according to the inputs from the Planning Phase.\n\n<br/>\nREVIEW THE TURN AND PREPARE FOR THE NEXT ONE\nTime is paused once again. You can move back and forth through the timeline, reviewing the events of the Action Phase to plan for the next turn.<br/>\nOnce both squadrons are ready, the turn is over and you jump to the next one.\n\n<br/>\nMANAGE YOUR SQUADRON\nScramble: Battle of Britain allows you to manage your Royal Air Force and Luftwaffe squadrons and to fly with your favourite planes.
