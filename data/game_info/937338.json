In the future I want to put some doors/buttons to interact that will trigger the game mode selected.</p>\n<p>Just an weekend project to see the what can I do with inspiration and free time. Please, does not expect too much. <em>Sugestions are welcome!</em></p>\n<p><strong>For now, what can I do on this game?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Walk around the map, shoot with a pre-defined gun, lantern, interact with objets and play with the transition between day and night, and the iconic blackout mode (inspired by that one on Watch Dogs franchise). There is no enemies, for now, is more like a proof of concept.</p>\n<p><strong>Commands:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>AWSD: Walk</em></li><li><em><em>Mouse Left Click: Shoot</em></em></li><li><em>Mouse Right Click: Turn on/off lantern</em></li><li><em>Space: Jump</em></li><li><em>E: Interact with some objects/elements</em></li><li><em>N: Change between day or night</em></li><li><em>B: When night, activate Blackout. Press again to turn all lights on.</em></li><li><em>ESC or fall down around the map: Quit Game</em></li></ul>\n<p>For now there is no campain/history mode. There is no Sprint button too.<br/>The game doesn't have a menu, HUD or even GUI for adjusting configurations, so just have a nice GPU to run it smooth! 1080p resolution Window Mode is the default mode for running it.</p>\n<p>Build up for Windows (.exe) and Linux (.bin)</p>\n<p><strong>Made on UPBGE 0.3 Alpha<br/>Modeled 100%\u00a0on Blender 3.3!</strong></p>\n<p>It is a PRE ALPHA build. Bugs and problems are common! Be patient and enjoy.</p>\n<p>If you want to see this game be bigger and better, support me with your donation!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T14:23:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a59a06c02110f65bcb8155257eee1272.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Urban Compass Pony"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
