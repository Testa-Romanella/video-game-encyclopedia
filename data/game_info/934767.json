His songs were unlike any other, but alas, he was also extremely annoying. One day, in a fit of wrath, the king cast Daniel into the den of lions.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daniel, undaunted, took his harp into the den with him. And there, surrounded by the roar of beasts, he began to play. But these were no ordinary beasts. The lions were highly sensitive to music and could distinguish good music from bad. One wrong note, and they would be upon him.</em></p>\n<p>Now it's your turn to take Daniel's hand and master the power of music in this rhythm game. Play your lyre\u00a0to lull the lions to sleep and help him escape with his life!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Guidan</strong><strong>ce:\u00a0</strong>Dani Bacon, Rutu Modan</p>\n<p>Art and Interaction\u00a0course, Bezalel Academy of Art and design, 2022\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T08:19:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e9/0e9f1c3ac5abb287e3977bc53b8640e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["DafnaSh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
