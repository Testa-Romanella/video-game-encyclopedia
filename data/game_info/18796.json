Pursued by a notorious cut-throat Pirate Hunter and a creepy French Physician who believes that Guybrush's eerily-infected hand holds the secret of eternal life, Threepwood sails the seven seas in search of La Esponja Grande, a legendary sea sponge with unparalleled voodoo exfoliating abilities. But little does Guybrush know, his quest is part of a larger, more sinister plot, and good and evil are not always as they seem...<br/>\r\n                    Who can Guybrush trust? Where can he turn? Everything you think you know will be challenged as Tales of Monkey Island builds to its unexpected finale!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:36:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e57af03918b91e78ff0b7c847260bfdd.jpg", "website": "http://www.telltalegames.com/monkeyisland", "rating": 3.57, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 42, "owned": 721, "beaten": 29, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 37, "suggestions_count": 423, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 37, "platforms": ["Wii", "PC"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games", "LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
