If you move more and more in the world it will generate more cubes and the game will be slower -&gt; The more game objects you have, the worse it is :( I just wanted to implement some procedural generation to practice, I even don't need that feature since the user just has 60 seconds to move around.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/002fcc1b3b8ef602ebeda476a99241a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kusaihana"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
