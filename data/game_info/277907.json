You fight as one of nine characters--three of which are unlockable--with looks, moves, and taunts based on kung-fu movie icons. Your quest for movie stardom places you on a dynamic movie set, and when the director yells &quot;Action!&quot; you fight against multiple enemies either by yourself or with three friends. Perform over-the-top, Hong-Kong-style combat--including leaps, and flying kicks--and you&#39;ll become a star in no time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:39:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/26c/26cc1e1e1895d454ad92726cea14e624.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 332, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Xbox"], "developers": ["Ninja Theory"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
