Mobile is not currently supported, but will be in the future.)</em></p>\n<br/>\n<p>\"This is the beginning of the age of steam.<br/> <br/>Our romance (currently at 55,000 words) is set at the transition between the Victorian world as it began, and the near-magical trajectory, into the new age of steam. <br/><br/>You play as Emma, who - through wile, wit, and good fortune - unlocks a secret that has remained dormant for two centuries.\u00a0 While many are keen to obtain the secret for themselves, others will stop at nothing to destroy it.\u00a0 Yet, using the secret results in unintended consequences, unleashing new forces that prove difficult to control. <br/></p>\n<p>However, a new age of invention is not the only thing blossoming. Emma has her hands full, not only with the mysterious secret, but some unexpected contortions of her heart\u2026 set in motion by a ruggedly handsome young machinist, a charming gentleman who comes to her rescue, a woman who defies Victorian norms, and a brilliant young man who carries many secrets of his own. <br/><br/>There\u2019s also an ancient order trying to overthrow the whole thing. Somehow Emma finds an unlikely ally among them...or is it a trap?\"</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n<p><strong>Emma</strong></p>\n<p>Our spunky main character in the year 1889. She\u2019s a 21 year old lady who is juggling the expectations of her family against what she truly wants. What is it she wants? Well, she\u2019s not entirely sure of that yet, but it\u2019s certainly not what others are expecting from a young Victorian lady.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While she\u2019s figuring out her future, she stumbles across an extraordinary secret that\u2019s lain hidden for over 200 years. The solution to this mystery involves getting to know an unusual cast of characters, who help Emma unlock both pieces of the puzzle, and new\u00a0romantic possibilities too.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Hiro</strong></p>\n<p>Hiro is an ambitious gentleman. He\u2019s just as charming as he is handsome, but with a bit of a dark side.\u00a0\u00a0Betting on the right people has allowed Hiro to work his way up to the peak of Victorian society, yet he remains unsatisfied.</p>\n<p>Emma\u2019s secret may be just what he needs to realize his most ambitious plans yet. But he\u2019s starting to discover that perhaps that\u2019s not what he wants from her after all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dalen</strong></p>\n<p>Dalen is a blacksmith with a stunning physique and a heart of gold. He\u2019s a childhood friend of Emma\u2019s and is struggling between the way he has always known her, and the fact that they\u2019re now all grown up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some may find him clueless in love, but everything is clear in Dalen\u2019s mind. He knows what he wants, and he believes he has it all already. But perhaps this whole time there\u2019s something right under his nose that he\u2019s missing after all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>\n<p>Helen is a woman who defies Victorian norms. She has played the game in a man\u2019s world and won. She makes no apologies for who she is and what she wants, and she has enjoyed great success as a result. Yet hard choices have led her to give up on many things as well. She has never had anyone she can truly share her life with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Emma, Helen sees a younger version of herself. Will she help change Emma\u2019s future? Or will Emma change hers?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Donovan</strong></p>\n<p>Donovan lives a spartan existence in a monk-like fraternity. Most find him rude and abrasive. He spends his days reading every book and manuscript he can get his hands on - he avoids people and detests interruptions.</p>\n<p>Yet Donovan\u2019s chosen life of isolation is a response to a colorful but painful past. Can he make room in his broken heart for someone new?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aiden</strong></p>\n<p>Aiden is a young scientist born in the wrong time and place. But don\u2019t underestimate him based on his boyish looks. With a remarkable creative mind, Aiden plans to devote himself to work that will change the world and make a real difference to everyday people.</p>\n<p>Yet realizing those noble aspirations may prove harder than he thinks.\u00a0Aiden may be in control of his inventions, but he\u2019s not in charge of what others will do with them. Oh, and he\u2019s on the path to choosing a loveless existence\u2026 but he\u2019s about to experience a sharp course-correction on that count. </p>\n\n<ul><li>Kat B.
