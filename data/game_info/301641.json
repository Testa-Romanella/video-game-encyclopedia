Wherever you go you'll be \n      facing unrelenting monsters, traps and locked passages, and can only \n      depend on yourself and your equipment to survive the trials.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      - Static, carefully handcrafted levels and level-hubs, all packed with \n      secrets, monsters and traps.\n    </p><p>\n      - Your character can wield up to 9 different weapons with alternative \n      fire modes, including melee armaments, spells, staffs and artifacts.\n    </p><p>\n      - Items can help you in tough situations, health potions will aid your \n      health, mana vials can restore your mana, combat items can do some \n      damage to an opponent.\n    </p><p>\n      - There are also more rare and powerful relics to be found, such as the \n      dreaded Obliterator Mask, which encases you in a suit of \n      nigh-impenetrable armor, allows you to bash enemies with your plain \n      fists and send powerful shockwaves across the walls and floor, or the \n      Essence of the Reaper, which turns you into an avatar of Death itself, \n      boosting your speed, granting you wings to perform double jumps and a \n      wicked scythe which cleaves and destroys any opponent.\n    </p><p>\n      - Some weapons and items can be used to stun enemies, freeze them solid, \n      deal area of effect damage or even provide defensive measures.\n    </p><p>\n      - The game uses a sophisticated gore system.
