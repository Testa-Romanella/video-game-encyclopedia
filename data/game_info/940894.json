The game was developed by me for the upper secondary school project which is the final and most important work done in Swedish upper secondary school. The game was developed during five-ish months. I originally planed to have six levels instead of three, however I decided to reduce it in order to have more time to polish the combat mechanics. If there is an interest I will probably expand amount.\u00a0Feedback and constructive criticism would be highly appreciated! Thank you for playing! :)</p>\n<p>Soundtrack is found here:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/moa-rosengren-534418833/sets/caverrion-soundtrack<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Exciting<em>\u00a0</em><strong><strong>vaguely\u00a0souls-like</strong></strong><em>\u00a0</em>combat!</li><li><strong>1</strong> boss battle!</li><li>C<strong>ontroller </strong>support</li><li>Built in speedrun <strong>timer</strong>!</li><li><strong>Three</strong>(!) whole levels!\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>10+\u00a0</strong>minutes of gameplay!!</li><li>Original <strong>soundtrack!</strong></li></ul>\r\nAssets used\r\n<p><em>Alagard </em>font by\u00a0<em>Hewett Tsoi</em>\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/alagard.font</p>\n<p><em>Hero nad Opponents Animation\u00a0</em>by\u00a0<em>Szadi Art.\u00a0</em>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/hero-nad-opponents-animation...</p>\n<p><em>Woosh </em>by <em>lebaston100\u00a0</em>https://freesound.org/people/lebaston100/sounds/264438/</p>\n<p><em>wind1.wav</em> by <em>Anton\u00a0</em>https://freesound.org/people/Anton/sounds/2690/</p>\n<p><em>Bricks/Stones/Rocks/Gravel Falling</em> by <em>iwanPlays\u00a0</em>https://freesound.org/people/iwanPlays/sounds/567249/</p>\n<p><em>Stone Steps</em> by <em>phil25\u00a0</em>https://freesound.org/people/Phil25/sounds/208103/</p>\n<p><em>Falling Bones.wav</em> by <em>spookymodem\u00a0</em>https://freesound.org/people/spookymodem/sounds/202091/</p>\n<p><em>Deep Cut / Slash / Gash</em> by <em>SypherZent\u00a0</em>https://freesound.org/people/SypherZent/sounds/420674/</p>\n<p><em>Body falling</em> by <em>NeoSpica</em>\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/NeoSpica/sounds/504617/</p>\n<p><em>Shield / sword hits.wav </em>by <em>ps2u</em>\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/ps2u/sounds/182112/</p>\n\n<p>!NOTICE!: I could not test the MAC and LINUX version since I don't have does computers, please comment if there is any problem running them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T12:46:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/284/284b39e2521cd1d364a2b75609defbe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["M.
