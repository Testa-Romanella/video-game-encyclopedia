So even if the character here looks like Pacman: it's not Pacman. The story is quite profound, about idealising relationships and wether or not finding one's missing piece is automatically going to equate in happiness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But along the way, it breaks a piece. This is about what might happen if it went back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project is not for profit. I claim no copy right on the story of figures and I will make no money off of its creation. It is a love letter to Silverstein's work, made for a gamejam 20.07.2020.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86e/86e3cef08dc72ecbdd5b24db1726673a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["singingstranger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
