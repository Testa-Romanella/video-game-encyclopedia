The player will be expected to actively attack the bosses, harassing them with light attacks, dodging through their attacks and finding openings to use their more powerful techniques. Impacts will be enhanced with glowing neon and techno/bass sound cues in order to deliver fast-paced and action-packed combat scenarios.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player controls a humanoid antivirus that has melee attacks, a dash and the power of telekinesis - with unlockable upgrades. Using these abilities the antivirus(player) must battle deadly computer viruses in order to protect its system.\r\n</p>\n<p>The visual style follows an 80\u2019s neon aesthetic, similar in style to Tron, however using a geometric abstract environment to suit an action game. Also more neon.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T07:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ecff8ff11f77f30e2642b19816a7663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joshua Keene", "Josh Hardy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
