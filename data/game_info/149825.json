Press escape at any time to exit the game.</p>\n<p>There's only 5 levels for now, mostly for tutorial and stage-progression prototyping purpose.</p>\n<p>Even so, feedback is welcome (and encourage!), I'd like to have some inputs regarding the feel of the grappling, the readability of the scenes, etc...<br/></p>\n<p>I plan on adding more challenging levels in the incoming days/weeks, so please stay tuned!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5e/e5ed2018c5f3f952e195dd75934c2777.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daratrix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
