Don't let the man keep you down and spray your soul all over the city!</p>\n<p>This is an early look at a game i'm developing. The idea is for it to turn into something akin to drawful where players can connect to a server on the computer or phones and do drawing mini games.</p>\n<p>Right now all that's down is the basic drawing engine, I wanted to emulate the way drawful handles is but also add things i felt were missing in the original game such as a width slider or color picker.</p>\n<p>For advanced drawers press D and A to rotate the canvas and draw in 3D!</p>\n<p>Otherwise mouse controls work. Just click!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efe/efee3511d76a00c5a5aff5302e6699a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["BuffCat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
