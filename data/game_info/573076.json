Constant reminders of topics that we feel we should care about, affect us or loved ones, or stress us out, are all around us. How do we balance being an informed citizen while not getting overwhelmed by news we have no control over? In Newscape the only objective is to survive for as long as you can by balancing being informed (awareness) and your capacity for dealing with negative information\u00a0(stress). Even if you have perfect survival, you cannot win to leave the game, because in real life we don't get the option of perfect life-balance, nor of stopping global events and coverage of them.</p>\n<p>WARNING: This game includes content that may be disturbing to some players.
