To deal with the rocks and hostile machinery, you've been given seven weapons, though they have their 'quirks' due to being untested. You'll only be able to use three weapons every two floors and on the third, the die will be rolled to determine the enemies you face, the extra weapon you have, and the attributes of a special cannon.</p>\n<p><strong><em>In other words, your behavior will determine how the die rolls. Weight it so it always goes in your favor.</em></strong></p>\n<p>As always, you will be evaluated on your performance. Collect as many gems as you can and defeat as many robots as possible to get the highest score!</p>\n<p>Basic controls: WASD to move, move the mouse to aim, and 'Space' to fire.\u00a0 Assuming the weapon is present, equip it by typing the number of dots representing it. (For example, press '1' to operate the Combustion Cannon.)\u00a0To operate 'the Dice\u00a0Cannon' on every third floor, press '7.' Advance to another level by finding a staircase.\u00a0If a rock seems 'normal,' like it has no ores, then breaking it reveals a staircase.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Roll of the Die:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Every third floor, the ground will change and there will be a large swarm of enemies.\u00a0\u00a0How you play on this floor will often depend on three factors, based on the previous two floors:</p>\n<ul><li>Dice Cannon: One of your weapons will always be locked to this.\u00a0Its attributes will change as described in the weapons glossary, specifically where it mentions what happens when a weapon is overused. What this means is the more you use a weapon, the higher the probability its\u00a0debuff will be applied.</li><li>Sidearm: Depending on the specific type of gem you collected on the previous two floors, you will have an increased chance of getting that specific one. In other words, pay attention to the ores you collect!</li><li>Enemies:\u00a0The enemies you kill will change how enemies spawn on the third floor. The more of a specific type you kill, the more likely that enemy will show up.</li></ul>\n<p>General Tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Staircases will be found at the edges of your screen.</li><li>To see what weapons you have equipped, look at the top right.</li><li>Your ammo count per weapon is based on how faded the die is.</li><li>Make sure to look at the middle left to see the highest probability of what will come up. Top represents the dice cannon, middle represents the most common type of gem, and bottom represents the enemy most likely to show up.</li><li>Make sure to look at the ores you collect! It's hard to see, but they do have some pips in them.\u00a0Collecting enough of an ore may increase the chance of getting a certain weapon.</li><li>There's some robots in the mines, but unfortunately, we don't have much data on them. Make sure to learn as you go! Our best suggestion is to\u00a0 use the walls as cover. They seem to be hostile whenever you can see them.\u00a0\u00a0Similar to the ores, they seem to have small dots on them.</li><li>Killing enemies will also affect whichever one shows up the most on each third floor, based on our research.\u00a0Keep in mind that other enemies are allowed to show up too though.</li></ul>\n<p>Glossary of Weapons:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>Singular Combustion\u00a0Cannon</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Combustion Cannon is, as the name implies, perfect for exploding objects.\u00a0Due to how reactive the ammo is, it only works at close range, so be mindful of enemies.\u00a0 Overuse of it may cause the dice cannon to have a reduced amount of bullets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 2.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>Dual Firing Turret</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The Dual Firing Turret, useful for sending a barrage of small bullets. They deal relatively minor damage, but its reload speed is useful in a pinch.\u00a0\u00a0Overuse may cause the dice cannon to deal less damage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 3.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>Triple Layered\u00a0Projector</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Need to block some bullets in a pinch? Use the Projector to block incoming fire for a brief second, then switch back to another weapon.\u00a0Its only drawback is its low reload rate and even worse ammo count. Overuse can result in the dice cannon reloading more slowly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 4.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>Quad View Sniper</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The Quad View Sniper was developed for long range killing, making it the strongest of the weapons. Unfortunately, it does suffer from needing a long time to reload and short firing rate. Overuse could reduce the fire rate of the dice cannon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 5.\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>Star H</strong><strong>ollowed Jacket</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Star Hollowed Jacket is similar to its Dual Turret brother,\u00a0 having a lower fire rate and ammo count in exchange for more damage. Overuse could reduce the speed of each bullet of the dice cannon.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 6.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>Six Powered\u00a0Rocket</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Six Powered Rocket is designed for raw damage, taking only three shots to break a wall. If you want long range and reliability, pick this. Overuse will mildly reduce the stats of the Dice\u00a0Cannon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 7.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>Dice Cannon</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>A weapon those in charge want you test each floor. Its fires dice where the effects change based on what weapon was overused.\u00a0Make sure to use each weapon equally, lest you risk modifying an undesirable attribute!</p>\n\n<p>Glossary of Ores:</p>\r\nCoalCopperPhosphateAntimonyGoldIronDiamondRubyTopazAmethystOnyxEmerald\r\n<p>The ores on the top row are 'common' and worth 10 points on your evaluation. The ores on the bottom row are 'rare' and worth 100 points, but they weigh the die five times as much as normal ore. Rare ores will also have more detailed designs when in the stone.</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ED74D_9Z5o8lCBsZtrJPbp0f_Now9zXi7xUcEhbdCmI/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T09:33:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/132/1321f1abc129dbfa741149f86f778337.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calavara"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
