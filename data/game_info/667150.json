{"id": 667150, "slug": "ninja-scroller", "name": "Ninja Scroller (itch)", "name_original": "Ninja Scroller (itch)", "description": "Collect all 100 Shadow Scrolls and eliminate their Guardian Ninjas.\r\nLegend has it that to own the Scrolls is to own Shadow and cheat Death.\r\nWelcome to the Ninja Scroller page.\r\nI introduce myself.\r\n<p>I'm Olivier Raveneau a French solo indie game developer from Marseille.</p>\n<p>I am from the MSX, Amiga generation.</p>\n<p>I am a programmer, game designer.</p>\n<p>I create games using the Mars Touch Studio trademark.</p>\r\nLet's talk about the game, Ninja Scroller.\r\n<p>Ninja Scroller is an action runner, that is to say that we start from the constraints of a runner, then we add action game elements.</p>\n<p>Basically the player is still running and you have to collect the Scrolls while avoiding the Ninja.</p>\n<p>Ninja will not kill you on first contact. They will have to strike you, jump kick or sword slash at you. And beware, they are as fast as you! Lucky for you, your sword is longer and remains dangerous for longer.</p>\n<p>But the attack will not always be the best defense, dodging while rolling on the ground will often save your life, as you will be invulnerable during the movement.</p>\n<p>You will often prefer to jump over several Ninja. The jump will also allow you to reach the top of the walls and collect otherwise inaccessible Scrolls. Be careful, however, during the ascending phase, you will be totally vulnerable. On the other hand, during the descent phase, you can use your sword and especially accelerate your descent. This last ability will allow you to shorten your jumps and will often save your life.</p>\n<p>What would be a good USP for an action oriented runner?</p>\n<p>Stop running! It allows you to break the rhythm, catch your breath and analyze the situation.</p>\n<p>Your main goal should be collecting scrolls, because as legend says, owning Scrolls is owning Shadow and cheating Death. The more scrolls you have, the more chance you have of surviving in the event of imminent death. But to win, it will also be necessary to eliminate all the Ninja.</p>\r\nLet's talk about the latest version of Ninja Scroller.\r\n<p>The game is at the pre-alpha stage, a lot is still missing:</p>\n<ul><li>No music.</li><li>No sound of environment (tell me if you want to hear a forest noise in the background, tropical birds songs, etc ...)</li><li>No SFX for the menus and some in-game need to be reworked (example, the ninja death sound which is too low).</li><li>No sound volume control.</li><li>No choice of difficulty level.</li><li>Playable only with the arrows on the keyboard.</li><li>No achievements.</li><li>No save.</li><li>Non-exhaustive list!</li></ul>\n<p>In this first demo, the difficulty is set on what will be the lowest.</p>\n<p>First of all, I would like to know in how much time you finish the game and your estimated level on this type of game.</p>\n<p>Constructive criticism of the overall feel of the game would be a plus.</p>\n<p>I am ready to listen to the community, but not necessarily to follow it.</p>\n<p>I will only keep the ideas compatible with my vision of the game.</p>\r\nKeyboard controls\r\n<p><strong>Up Arrow</strong>: Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Right Arrow</strong>: On the ground or when falling use the sword</p>\n<p><strong>Down Arrow</strong>: Roll on the ground, while falling accelerate the fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Left Arrow</strong>: Stop running.</p>\n<p>If Ninja Attack hits you, there is a certain probability that you will automatically drop a smoke bomb, saving your life.</p>\n<p>The probability is proportional to the number of Scrolls collected.</p>\n<p>Press the <strong>space bar</strong> to exit the Game Over screen.</p>\n<p><em>Last updated on September 19, 2021</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T05:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce8/ce8d5f56ef8aeb1ddde1ee8c68c752ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mars Touch Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
