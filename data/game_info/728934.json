Very simply, it's a randomized city builder! All you need is a set of dominoes and you're good to go! There are two versions of the pdf below, one is for 6 pip sets (named 6p) and the other is for 15 pip sets (15p). If your dominoes reach 9 pips, just grab the 15 pip sheet and adapt it as you want.</p>\n<p>If you want to build a city with randomized citizens in it, make sure to read the <em>Dwellers of Domino City</em> page before you start setting down tiles. You'll need some dice to make <em>Dwellers </em>work, but it's ultra lightweight so change it as you see fit!</p>\n<p>Without a doubt this was inspired by Italo Calvino's book <em>Invisible Cities</em>, which I made into a fair use bot on Twitter (@bot_cities, if you want to check it out)! Every few hours it tweets out a beautiful and thought-provoking line from the book, which is a catalogue of impossible cities Marco Polo relates to Kubilai Khan.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for a different aesthetic entirely, I would love to see remixes made for specific genres (maybe fantasy or cyberpunk?). All I ask is that you include an attribution to me and this original game, as per CC BY 3.0. That's it! Also, the assets I used are all public domain and you can find hundreds of them on Wikimedia Commons, from Pearson. There's plenty of plants, ships, and people.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking a gander!</p>\n<p>- Ewan Matthews<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T10:17:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ff/8ff1520f43107b87d929219197eab511.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ewan Matthews"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
