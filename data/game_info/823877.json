Get ready to race against Felix Rijhnen, Bart Swings, and many more stars from the sport. In this game, you will have to manage your energy level by using the draft behind the other skaters. Will you be able to get a good position before the last corner and take a good trajectory like in real life? <br/>This game includes all in the price, no need to buy extra goods to get better as the results will only depend on your driving skills. You can even play offline or in-plane mode if you want. <br/>In this game, you will have 3 levels to enjoy the racing feeling on inline speed skates. When the easy mode will help you to learn how to control smoothly the skater, the medium and hard one will be more challenging.<br/>Control the skater with the joystick and sprint using the special button. If you can race well, you will unlock some new circuits, new skinsuits from your favorite sponsors like ROLLERBLADE, POWERSLIDE, EOSKATES, or many more. You can also win some cool skates or helmets. Race in championship mode in your favorite specialty: SHORT, MEDIUM, or LONG distance to become a local, national, or even THE WORLD CHAMPION. If you do so, you will probably get access to the longest lap in the game to get a feeling of the 24h roller race against all the 40th skaters from the game.<br/>Race smart and use the draft to recharge your energy level. Use a good trajectory to pass or block your favorite opponent or even the LEGEND skater (the one with a hollow circle around the helmet).<br/>Become an expert on each of the 10 laps and even enjoy a bit of a downhill feeling on the Rocky Mountain lap just before the final sprint.<br/>If you are ready, it's time to select your player, your number, and go to the starting line and if you get a good result or if you beat a LEGEND it's time to take a screenshot and share it on your social media to promote our exciting sport.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T10:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3b9ab3bfe504fc80a6513f23052ce39_Bk4ku8o.jpg", "website": "http://www.jellever.be/interactives/proinlineskating/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["BRIAND PASCAL"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["BRIAND PASCAL"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
