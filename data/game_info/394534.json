Contrary to most<br/>modern games, Ender\u2019s Life places more focus on<br/>the gameplay as compared to the graphics. This<br/>allows for the simpler elements within the game<br/>such as the functions, platforms and movements to<br/>be of more focus.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc327120c0df5b61bb90d2659cecc40d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yngjoez"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
