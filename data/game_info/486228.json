I know I'm not permitted to edit the game after the jam has officially ended but I wanted to upload a fixed version in-case anyone still wants to play it, so here it is! (about 45 minutes after the deadline, just like my assignments at\u00a0uni)\u00a0https://tim-david.itch.io/stronger-together-but-with-1-bug-fix-that-makes-it-actually-playable<br/></p>\n<p>CW: Swearing</p>\n<p>This game is honestly a bit of a mess.</p>\n<p>I over scoped and didn't leave enough time to finish the latter half of the game properly so it's very rushed and stuffed in there at the last minute, but I hope you will still enjoy what you can of it either way :)</p>\n\n<p>How I used the theme:</p>\n<p>The theme was \"take care\" so I wanted to make a game about 2 characters taking care of each other. In \"stronger together\" one character can fight, the other can platform better, so they need each other to succeed.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Fortunately with 3 minutes remaining I remembered too turn off my debug markers, but had to upload a 2nd build, feel free to give the original version I uploaded to see some behind the scenes stuff lol.</p>\n\n<p>Controls: (Also shown\u00a0in game)</p>\n<p>A - D to Move</p>\n<p>Space to Jump</p>\n<p>Tab to Warp</p>\n<p>Shift to Swap</p>\n<p>Click to Attack</p>\n<p>Alt + F4 to quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f82/f82882a069510260e602fc4063b90117.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tim David"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
