The current available build is a very early indev version strictly provided for play-testing purposes. It does not reflect the final product. <br/></p>\n<p>*This project is currently using Synty assets as placeholders for development purposes. Although I plan on using some of these assets in the final game as generic level decoration, the ultimate goal is to use my own art for most characters, weapons and set-pieces.</p><p>Want to help support the development of my games while also receiving a behind the scenes look at upcoming work?
