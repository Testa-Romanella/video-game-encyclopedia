The more bugs the player clicks, the higher the score. Consecutive clicks on bugs will increase the combo multiplier, which further increases the score.\u00a0 With each score boundary, the game level increases. The higher the level, the faster the bugs move.\u00a0The time limit is set to 60 seconds, though can change if the player clicks on random time powerups that appear in the level.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T10:56:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/854/854b5e13cfab8a5593c75cd0a67a140f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kafele Palmer-Hunt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
