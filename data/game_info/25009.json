As Shawn tentatively approaches the dilapidated structure, the \n      entrance door swings open, and he's drawn into a magical vortex. Now, \n      with Ace at his side, Shawn must embark on the greatest adventure of his \n      life...into the heart of the Deep Labyrinth.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e02/e02d1689ac99df3a047cf332288ef944.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Interactive Brains"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": null}
