Brooke Lafferty (American actress, model and franchise) has been accused of murdering her equally famous husband. How the trial pans out is down to you as the player.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe first instalment of the game is titled 'Before the Trial' - Meaning, this is the time where you are entering the hotel (exclusive to jury members) and 'get to know one another'. What that means, is up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStart friendships, relationships and find enemies in the first few days before the trial starts. The choices you make in this stage of the game will set up further opportunities. However, with every opportunity gained comes an opportunity missed! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nJury AVN is a game where you will need to play through multiple times to unlock all the content, see all the scenes and attract all the girls. This isn't a linear storyline, where your game is the same every time you play it. There are countless combinations of ways to interact and make choices that will either end in some delicious animated scenes, or come back and bite you in the ass later in the game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo the question to you is...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCan you hack it on the Jury?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T05:13:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b4/7b42d888a771039c2a5ec32e2bbee695.jpg", "website": "https://www.jury-avn.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 459, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nickle3DArt"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Nickle3DArt"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
