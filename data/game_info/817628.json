After the deadline, I really liked the idea so I\u00a0polished it up and tried to make an executable for others to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is simple: get to the goal point without touching any spikes. The twist is that you're going to need to manipulate gravity to get there. There are 3 levels in total, each one harder than the last. The game counts your deaths for each level and shows you the total at the end. My current best is 20 deaths, see if you can beat it.\u00a0Hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>Side Note: I've had a lot of trouble getting these executables to work, so please let me know if the game isn't opening for you and whether you're using the mac or windows version.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W\u00a0 (or up arrow)\u00a0- Gravity up</p>\n<p>S (or down arrow)\u00a0- Gravity down</p>\n<p>A (or left arrow) - Left</p>\n<p>D (or right arrow)\u00a0- Right</p>\n<p>SPACE - Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T14:38:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/385/3854c995e427e22ecabf3d13e812843b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gold249"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
