The only way to change your speed is to change the distance of your orbit. The closer to the Sun you get, the faster you'll go. But be careful, as Asteroids fly into the Sun, gravity increases, and so do orbital speeds! Your only objective is to survive as long as possible! There is no time for caution! Good luck and have fun!<br/><br/><br/>In space, your orbital speed is determined by your distance to the Sun. Use W/S (or Up and Down Arrow Keys) too change your orbital distance, and thus your speed. But be careful! Catching Comets is hard enough without needing to keep an eye out for a bombardment of Asteroids, or without crashing into the inner Planets; Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Endless, fast paced and challenging Arcade experience <br/></li><li> Easy to learn, difficult to master<br/></li><li> Unique gameplay concept based on real world physics<br/></li><li> Modern take on classic arcade games<br/></li><li> 20+ unique ship skins to be unlocked with in game points (cosmetic)<br/></li><li> Steam Achievements<br/></li><li> Perfect for playing in lobby for another game, or in long (boring) zoom meetings ;)<br/></li><li> Great soundtrack by various independent composers with in-game track switcher</li></ul><br/><br/>Hi, friendpatine here! Thank you for checking out my game Apsis. Recently I've have been learning to make games, and Apsis will be my first release on Steam!<strong> Apsis is an arcade score-chaser, where the only goals are to constantly beat your previous score and unlocking new ships</strong>. It's a pretty fun way to waste an evening if i do say so myself, but I'd love to hear what you think about it (yes, YOU in-particular)! Please contact me on my Website or via Twitter if you find any bugs, anything you find misleading/incorrect about this store page, or just wanted to say hi!<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to read this, I hope you enjoy Apsis!<br/>Will B.
