At first, no one knew what was happening. Then, the screams started. The students and teachers soon realized that something was very wrong. People were getting sick, but it wasn't any ordinary illness. Those who were infected turned into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. As chaos reigned, a small group of survivors banded together to try and make it out alive. They barricaded themselves in a classroom, but soon realized that they would need to venture out to find supplies and weapons. As they moved through the corridors, the group faced challenges and dangers at every turn. The zombies lurked around every corner, and the survivors were constantly on the verge of being overrun. Despite the odds against them, the group remained determined to make it out alive. But as they searched for a way out, they began to uncover a sinister plot behind the outbreak. It seemed that the zombie virus had been deliberately unleashed, and the group realized that they were not just fighting for their own survival, but for the fate of the entire school. As the survivors fought their way through hordes of zombies and confronted the evil mastermind behind the outbreak, they knew that they were in for the fight of their lives. But they also knew that they had to succeed, or risk being trapped forever in a world overrun by the undead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T07:16:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e0/3e0f345a05547db90ef0d5f6b11b0a39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TrueDGamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
