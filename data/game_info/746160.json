Try and consume as many flowers as possible before they reach your hive and clog it up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>Click and Drag to shoot (anywhere on the screen)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Elf Meditation Preview by Kevin MacLeod\r\n</p>\n<p>Link:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5728-elf-meditation-preview\r\n</p>\n<p>License:\u00a0https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>TEAM:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Art: IG @artemetto_\r\n</p>\n<p>Programming: (Me) BangTheWall\r\n</p>\n<p>Design: Both of us :D\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:35:20", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["BangTheWall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
