This time you team up with him to work on a school project. However, in this night something strange happens. Suddenly you&#39;re locked inside your own room and a dark power menaces your life! Can you find a way out of your room? Can you even survive this night? Pay attention to your environment and you might have a chance to escape.Sleepless Night is a horror/psycho sound novel. For the full game experience, you should play at night alone in your room and turn the volume up. There are no 18+ scenes in the game, I would recommend the game for 13+, but it is very scary and there are a lot of shockers in it, so be warned!Credits:<br />\nStory, characters, music \u2013 Marcel Weyers<br />\nCharacter art \u2013 NoodleBrains<br />\nBackgrounds \u2013 Auro-Cyanide, Mei Miyamura<br />\nAdditional graphics \u2013 Torsten Sohrmann<br />\nScript editing \u2013 SusanTheCat<br />\nAndroid version \u2013 Bob Reus (Visualnovels.nl)<br />\niOS version \u2013 y5-apps<br />\nEngine \u2013 Ren&#39;PyGerman translation \u2013 Marcel Weyers<br />\nSpanish translation \u2013 El Lobo Demente<br />\nDutch translation \u2013 Bob Reus (Visualnovels.nl)<br />\nPolish translation \u2013 Adrian Hofman, Vynuxys, Sakai<br />\nItalian translation \u2013 Andrea Luciano &#39;Lehti&#39; Damico<br />\nKorean translation \u2013 hgdear<br />\nFrench translation \u2013 Liossenel Ashfox<br />\nPortuguese translation \u2013 Rita Alves<br />\nRussian translation \u2013 Anne<br />\nMalay translation \u2013 CrimsonMoon<br />\nJapanese translation \u2013 Ernestalice15<br />\nIndonesian translation \u2013 kirichuu<br />\nChinese translation \u2013 Atsuko-chan<br />\nSpecifications:<br />\nTitle: Sleepless Night<br />\nRelease: March 31, 2012<br />\nGenre: Horror/Psycho<br />\nRated: 13+<br />\nResolution: 1600\u00d71200<br />\nPlatforms: Android, iOS, Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Linux<br />\nEndings: 10<br />\nLanguages: Chinese, English, French, Dutch, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish<br />\nVersion: 1.9.1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-08T20:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/615/61549ec7796e31b71e113da6736f408e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Marcel Weyers"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
