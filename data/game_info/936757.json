If a block ends its move in an activation point, the energy grid will activate and the puzzle is complete. If a block ends its move on a mine it will explode and the puzzle will reset. Yellow blocks behave normally while purple blocks will bounce one block back off the edge of the grid.\u00a0</p><p>When blocks move on mud they will travel until they reach the edge of the grid or another block. When blocks reach gravel they immediately stop due to the friction.</p><p>Activate all 14 energy grids to complete the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T07:31:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5feed99f717a0cf944f86abe78c4f43f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yamzxy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
