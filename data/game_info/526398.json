The culprit? - The Three Body Problem, the universe\u2019s most unsolvable problem.</p>\n<p>While living a gracious life on their home planet, Kortanz, the Kingfishers knew that their time was limited. After all, their planet orbited two other celestial bodies in a manner so chaotic that it would be a miracle if they didn\u2019t collide in the near future. But to make matters worse, one of those bodies was a star. Collision wasn\u2019t necessary, even going near their home star would mean instant death for all life on their planet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Kingfisher\u2019s fate was hopeless -\u00a0</p>\n<p>but then came the Cosmic Samurai.</p>\n<p>Known as the Knight that defends our universe, the Cosmic Samurai did his best to solve the Three Body Problem - until one day, a solution appeared! Cosmic Samurai discovered the \u201cSwitch Teleport\u201d ability, which allowed the Cosmic Samurai to displace Kortanz into another solar system and away from harm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Universe thought that all matters had been resolved, but then the unthinkable happened.
