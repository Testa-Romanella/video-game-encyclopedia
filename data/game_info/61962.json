Differently of other games of its gender, Puzzle Noid develops the player perception making your vision going beyond what it's visible, at the same time it tests your deductive capacity. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe gameplay consists in opening the minimum of tilings the faster you can, using your capacity of deduction in pointing blindly the right answers, reaching the best score possible. Besides that, Puzzle Noid has the differential of being almost 100% handmade, bringing unique pieces with an impressive artstyle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main theme is anthropomorphism (half human, half animals) portraits which are a fixation of the artist @Mabritoilustra.
