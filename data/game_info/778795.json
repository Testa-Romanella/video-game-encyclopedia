AND IF YOU WANT TO BEAT IT WITH 1 NOTEBOOK, YOU NEED TO GET ALL THE QUESTIONS WRONG ON THE 1ST ONE!!!!!! also, you can roam around the school freely until you decide to get that 1 notebook. ill probably add an update that blocks all the walls off so you dont get more than 1 notebook. with all that out of the way, try to enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T08:55:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51db6381dc484b198c6ae415f1e93b13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ashtonmodder"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
