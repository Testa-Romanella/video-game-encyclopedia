{"id": 508435, "slug": "among-us-powerpoint-edition", "name": "Among Us: PowerPoint Edition", "name_original": "Among Us: PowerPoint Edition", "description": "<p>This is singleplayer, not multiplayer.<br/>Its freeplay mode XD.<br/>This needs lots of support to be released and needs to be done any minute.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>One crewmate has been replaced by a parasitic shapeshifter. Their goal is to eliminate the rest of the crew before the ship reaches home. The Impostor will sabotage the ship, sneak through vents, deceive, and frame others to remain anonymous and kill off the crew.</p>\n<p>While everyone is fixing up the ship, no one can talk to maintain anonymity. Once a body is reported, the surviving crew will openly debate who they think The Impostor is. The Impostor's goal is to pretend that they are a member of the crew. If The Impostor is not voted off, everyone goes back to maintaining the ship until another body is found. If The Impostor is voted off, the crew wins!<br/><br/>I do not intend to steal Innersloth's masterpiece. You can buy Among Us for only $5 which is very cheap. But, if you really don't wanna buy, that's alright. Thanks for the support and hopefully this project will shoot out when published. <br/>And of course, bye!<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>. \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3002\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2022\u3000 \u3000\uff9f\u3000\u3000\u3002 \u3000\u3000.</p>\n<p>\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3002\u3000\u3000 \u3002\u3000. \u3000</p>\n<p>.\u3000\u3000 \u3002\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2022        . \u3000\u3000 \u2022 \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u2022</p>\n<p>\u3000\u3000\uff9f\u3000NotFlamingo was not An Impostor.\u3000 \u0d9e\u3002\u3000.</p>\n<p>\u3000\u3000'\u3000\u3000\u3000 1 Impostor remains \u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3002</p>\n<p>\u3000\u3000\uff9f\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000\u3000\u3000.  \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000.\u3000 .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T07:35:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe0/fe09ec270c5a5945f09af6c86f66d26f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["NotFlamingo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
