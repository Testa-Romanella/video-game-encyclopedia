Falling out of the bounds of the map loses you 10 points also, so jump well.</p><p>When you die, you instantly respawn in the center of the map, where the enemies will no doubt be viciously waiting for you, so don't waste a SINGLE one of those precious seconds, and get back into the action!</p><p>|| Controls ||</p><p>LEFT CLICK = shoot<br/>RIGHT CLICK = punch<br/>W, A, S, D = movement scheme<br/>SPACEBAR = jump<br/>ESCAPE = exit scene (on the title screen this closes the game)</p><p>|| Developer's Notes ||</p><p>This is my first ever completed game, and I'm really excited to see what you guys have to say! Please don't hold back in criticism, I'd rather get a harsh but detailed description of where I can improve than a useless but kind one (although don't be afraid to say if you like the game!).</p><p>Please Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0e/b0e30a352c150778b8ed328a1fd67081.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DavonMoss"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
