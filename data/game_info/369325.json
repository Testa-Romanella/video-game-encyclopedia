The theme was \"What lies beneath\".\u00a0 I was not able to attend the game jam, but I loved the theme so much that I wanted to make something. I was heavily time constrained, so I put together a tiny narrative game in one night. <em>(4 hours)</em><br/></p>\n<p>The concept is very simple. You have 3 resources, current breath, air store, and health. You take damage if you do not breathe for too long, or if you sink too \u00a0fast. You can stop sinking by using the 'Space' key to swim up. But this uses up some of your air. If your health reaches zero you die.<br/></p>\n<p>You 'win' if you can read the whole story.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Space Key - Swim Up<br/>Up Arrow - Breath air</p>\r\nAdditional Credits\r\n<p><em>Music</em><br/>Naoya Sakamata - Dissociation (slowed to 50%)<br/>https://soundcloud.com/naoya-sakamata/dissociation-most-sad-piano-music</p>\n<p><em>Fonts</em><br/>https://www.fontspace.com/chequered-ink/mono-a-mano<br/>https://www.dafont.com/traveling-typewriter.fon<br/><em><br/>Theme</em><br/>https://albertagamejam.ca/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T03:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a28/a28094f3800b47e277d80d3be7fa5f92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["glitch-land"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
