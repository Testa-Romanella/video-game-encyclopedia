Are they more beautiful than the garden they're inside of? There's only one way to find out.</p>\n<p>Flashbulb Litter Survey is a presentation of what I feel could be a very cool game mechanic if fleshed out properly. When you take a \"photograph\", a screenshot is copied to your clipboard, and you must \"develop\" it by pasting it into your favorite graphics program and using the various tools there to fill it in and put it all back together. A game where a majority of the gameplay takes place outside of its .EXE. I think this would be fantastic if implemented as part of a horror game, or mystery game, a puzzle solving game, an archaeology sim... an erotic thriller... the list goes on.</p>\n<p>While there wasn't really an intended message when I started making this, I do believe there is something to be said about preserving art, whether or not it's worthwhile to try to preserve everything, etc. An interesting thought I had is that one day I may lose the original files, and the only way I'll be able to get them back is to play this and piece them together myself. Even then, the end result won't be quite the same as the original.</p><p>Flashbulb Litter Survey was made with Clickteam Fusion 2.5 and utilizes the Screen Capture Object.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T06:39:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9afe303fcf8bf901e873fa6757188e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scroungin' 4 Catsup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
