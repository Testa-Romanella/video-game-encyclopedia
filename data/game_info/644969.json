This is my brand-new project.<br/><br/>It is a little chess game made it with a graphic library: Raylib.<br/><br/>The game is for two players, this means that you cannot play with the computer.<br/><br/>Because this is a prototype, there are some aspects of the chess that aren't covered here, like the castling or the pawn\u00a0 crowning. Also have on mind that this chess will let you make\u00a0errors like, let your king on chess, even when on the real chess you cannot move a piece that let you king on check. In this game if you make something like that, the player will lose instantly.\u00a0<br/><br/>Being explained all that, I hope you enjoy the prototype game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T04:53:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6f/c6f1fc627f6180d682fd7a2c2ba2b250.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Facundo Ponce"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
