So we decided on shooting everyday objects from a catapult. Obviously.<br/><br/><br/>A bathtub itself may only kill the minion it directly hits, but it also spills water. While it doesn\u2019t deal any direct damage, just add an electrical toaster\u2026<br/><br/><br/>\u2026 and you suddenly electrocute all the minions standing in it!<br/><br/>A car itself deals decent damage, but it\u2019s also a great means of transportation for your other weapons - just put a magnet on it and you will disarm a lot of minions on its way!
