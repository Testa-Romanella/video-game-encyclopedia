Simple as that.</p>\n<p>It's a remake, kind of, planning to add:</p>\n<p>- More bosses with unique attacks</p>\n<p>- More areas</p>\n<p>- More characters, maybe even to PLAY as.</p>\n<p>- Shop</p>\n<p>- Crafting. meaning harder puzzles and more thinking.</p>\n<p>- Making the game way harder, game takes longer to beat once it's finished.</p>\n<p>THIS GAME IS FOR PEOPLE ABOVE AT LEAST THE AGE OF 12. THIS GAME CONTAINS:</p>\n<p>Swear words, violence, gore might be added.</p>\n<p>Also..</p>\n<p>This game has some songs that<strong> may\u00a0</strong>be copyrighted, however I have no intentions on making money off of this game, making it for fun.</p>\n<p>I am NOT a furry. There are no transfurs, probably not adding them. Making it slightly serious.</p>\n<p>CURRENT VERSION: O.0.1 (2 areas, unfinished rooms, one boss.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T17:20:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72e/72eb3d98db57960b632102f3310ee7f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kristos"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
