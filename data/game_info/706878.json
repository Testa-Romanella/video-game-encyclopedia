As traits are passed on through generations, selective biases will favor mobs with advantageous attributes. This is the fundamental basis of evolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Herbivores</strong> eat plants, the green circles, which spawn on the map periodically.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Carnivores</strong> eat herbivores, which is extremely inefficient, meaning there will tend to be much fewer carnivores<br/></p>\n<p>You can <strong><em>create your own mobs</em></strong> that are born with custom traits and then spawn them freely.</p>\n\r\nThe creature creator gives you the freedom to make weird, unsustainable monstrosities\r\n\n<p>Clicking on mobs will display their<strong> traits and statuses</strong>, providing a slice of how they're evolving.</p>\n<p>This project was built over the course of 9 days, taking roughly 25 hours to create from start to finish. I appreciate any feedback that can be provided in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:51:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a139186398f48ccc6bca389a55a3185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eapple"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
