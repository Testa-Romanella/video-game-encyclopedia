Here things are a bit different. In order to complete a level, you have to carefully aim for targets ($) and dive-attack. Then you hit a detonator at the base level of the city.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\n<p>In-game press <space> or <down> to attack; <esc> will quit the screen you are in (in case of the Game Over Screen, it exits the game). You can press 'm' to toggle audio on/off (only works in-play &amp; during the briefing rollout).<br/></esc></down></space></p>\r\n\r\nHints\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid(!) buildings (you lose $). Hit with range (you win $). You need a score of 1000 to survive the detonator blast. A score of zero or below means Game Over. There's more (incl. cheats) .. keep playing / looking :)\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>\n<p>\u00a0This game should run on any late 1980s era 16bit DOS PC setup or Dosbox (3000 cycles is good enough).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p>\u00a0Design &amp; game by tomaes, May 2020</p>\n\n<p><strong>Web</strong>: <br/></p><p>Source at: https://github.com/tomaes<br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>#00001<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:34:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04ea75c2fce42d4a831c156b19abde66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tomaes"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
