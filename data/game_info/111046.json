In the game, you play as a cameraman for a news network. Each day, you are sent to the scene of a wartime event, be it a rally or execution. Depending on what is filmed, the bias of the country will shift either towards the Loyalists, who want to keep the current president in power, or the Rebels, who are fighting for change in government.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d28706f71b731414bd495913d947c08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["deipfei"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
