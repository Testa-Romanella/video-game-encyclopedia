This is the game for you. As 'out of control' as the GMTK jam's theme is, you and your AI-controlled partner in crime will roam the halls of a creepy orphanage, avoiding the strict nun and with an ambition to find any kid's Holy Grail:\u00a0a cookie. Remember to put a cardboard box on yourself so you don't raise suspicion, and even then, proceed with caution, because the Nun is out to get anybody who sneaks out after 9!\u00a0And this just happens to be you...<br/><br/>Music and Sound Design by Marek Domaga\u0142a \u2013 YouTube:\u00a0https://bit.ly/2CoNM0O</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ea/0ea726cd86f0a75867d43a8f28c4f98c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Taugeshtu", "marekdomagala"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
