Both of you (Yes, both of you) are suspects of a ridiculous crime, and you've each got evidence - leverage - against one another to prove it.

The neighbor with the most evidence (and a beating heart) by the end of five minutes wins!</p>\r\nFollow the game's development on...\r\n<p>Twitter<br/>Discord<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/829a586113ac63ab5544d272a1f0de56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Krymtel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
