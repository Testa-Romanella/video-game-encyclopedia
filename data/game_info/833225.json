If you're really lonely, you can control all 4 characters by yourself but that won't be as interesting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T16:37:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4e/d4e4f9e614b2f4a488684aaf7b91b9fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yeo Yeo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
