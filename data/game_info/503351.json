The game starts immediately, but if I had a bit more time or skill I had added a delay or start screen.</p>\n<p>I participated in the jam alone using Unity.\u00a0All assets are done by me with Krita (art) and LMMS (sound).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:22:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/739/73935d3149afc88fc674a1bcd1101e73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["8BitMuffin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
