It's not a big deal, you're old enough to take care of yourself now. It's simple, just do the chores your parents left for you and the night will be all yours... or will it?</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is a short, atmospheric horror demo/prototype that dumbs down the gameplay and turns up the scares. How will you handle the obstacles laid before you? Will you stumble and become a victim, or be brave, and leave freely?</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER NOTES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game submitted to Itch and my first game jam submission. There are many aspects about this game that I would love to improve on, but as of writing this, it's 5:00AM and I just want to get this uploaded and drink to celebrate. So, I hope you enjoy this short game. If it wasn't obvious already, I was heavily inspired by games like Fears To Fathom and the Puppet Combo titles. Really cool developers/games, you should check 'em out. Anyways, congratulations to all my fellow <strong>Brackeys Game Jam</strong> participants, and thanks to <strong>Brackeys </strong>for teaching me so many helpful things.</p>\n<p>PS: I forgor \ud83d\udc80 to mention that all the low poly models were sourced from\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>CREDITS LINK</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-12T02:27:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bd/7bd84d62ef529554a4678fa6fc674267.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mediasaur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
