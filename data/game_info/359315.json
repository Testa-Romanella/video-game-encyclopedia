Defeating enemies and solving puzzles, she leaps from platform to platform, travelling through different landscapes.<br/><br/>The game holds an abstract aesthetic that has become characteristic for House of Secrets, the studio behind KIN, through their earlier VR experiences such as APEX and Surge.<br/><br/>KIN supports both the original VR mode from when it was first launched, as well a new camera mode and input system that allows the game to be played as a traditional non VR platformer.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d99/d9950f7952d9ab150ba21cdd4664cd5b.jpg", "website": "http://www.kin-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["House of Secrets"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["House of Secrets"], "esrb_rating": null}
