{"id": 780718, "slug": "exorcism-simulator", "name": "Exorcism Simulator", "name_original": "Exorcism Simulator", "description": "Description<p>We sought out to create an interactive experience that mimics the aesthetics and beats of a demonic possession story (e.g., the <em>Exorcist</em>). The player takes on the role of an exorcist who must guess which demon out of a list of alternatives is possessing a human victim. In our game, the player is shown clues that hint at what traits are being displayed by the demon. Based on the traits that the player observes, they then read descriptions of each possible demon that hint at the combination of traits they have. The correct demon is the one that matches those displayed through the clues. Once the player selects a demon, they say a prayer to rid the demon of their possessor. If the player guesses the correct demon, the exorcism is successful.</p>\n<p>We based our clues on behaviors of demons seen in media, such as the movies <em>The Exorcist</em> or <em>The Witch</em>, and in books from observers of alleged real-life exorcisms, such as Malachi Martin\u2019s <em>Hostage of the Devil</em> and the Vatican\u2019s own <em>Exorcisms and Certain Supplications</em>. The game loop of gathering clues, guessing the correct demon, and then saying a prayer matches the steps to an exorcism enumerated in the foreword of <em>Hostage of the Devil</em>.<br/></p>Sources\r\n<ul><li>Parchment paper background by\u00a0sinnedaria on DeviantArt.\r\n</li><li>Cloth background by\u00a0engine akyurt on Unsplash\r\n</li><li>bgm.mp3 comes from\u00a0Jason Shaw on AudionautiX. the original composition was named \"Alien Sunset\" used according to creative commons attribution 4.0 license, which can be seen here:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\u00a0file was renamed to \"bgm.mp3\"--no other modifications to the data the use of this file does not constitute the creator's endorsement\r\n</li><li>laugh.wav comes from\u00a0JuliusMabe on freesound.org. used according to creative commons attribution 3.0 license, which can be seen here:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\u00a0file was renamed to \"laugh.wav\"--no other modifications to the data the use of this file does not constitute the creator's endorsement\r\n</li><li>whisper.mp3 comes from\u00a0Magnesus on freesound.org\u00a0the creator of this sound has waived their rights according to the creative commons 0 license\r\n</li><li>Trice Download and Information:\u00a0https://github.com/incobalt/Trice\r\n</li><li>Tweego Download and Information:\u00a0https://github.com/tmedwards/tweego\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>All alterations of images were done manually using paint.NET.\r\n</p>\n<p>Licenses</p>\n<ul><li>Unsplash:\u00a0https://unsplash.com/license\r\n</li><li>Paint.NET:\u00a0https://www.getpaint.net/license.html\r\n</li><li>Tweego:\u00a0https://github.com/tmedwards/tweego/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T13:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24a69d675ff9e03172f409079aea5b5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["raisthewolf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
