Boot up game once. This automatically builds the folders.</p>\n<p>2. Place RoomPlan \".GLTF\" file into the folder</p>\n<p>Quest 2\\Internal shared storage\\Android\\data\\com.Cazforshort.RoomScan\\files\\</p>\n<p>3.

Make your own account here for much faster generation:</p>\n<p>https://stablehorde.net/</p>\n<p>There is a button on the keyboard \"API Settings\" that will let you type in a 4 digit https://qtext.io/ code in order to copy and paste your Horde API key into the game instead of the default key. Hit \"Set Key\" to capture it.</p>\n<p>Detailed Instructions:</p>\n<p>1. Boot up the game once and quit.</p>\n<p>2. Download a RoomPlan ios app that exports in GLTF format. Most are paid so here is a free multistep alternative:</p>\n<p>2.a. Download the free app called RoomPlan on iOS by Locometric. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roomplan/id1628787713</p>\n<p>2b.

Change the extension from \".usdz\" to \".zip\" and extract the file with the \".usdc\" extension.</p>\n<p>2e. Convert the \".usdc\" to \".GLTF\". I did this for free by importing it into blender and exporting it there. Note that there is a \"GLTF\" setting on the export page you will need to select.</p>\n<p>3. Drop the \".GLTF\" file into the folder</p>\n<p>Quest 2\\Internal shared storage\\Android\\data\\com.Cazforshort.RoomScan\\files\\</p>\n<p>4. Start up the app again and you are good to go!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T11:26:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25dd67abe575bd68b53e762bb8292c69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["cazforshort"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
