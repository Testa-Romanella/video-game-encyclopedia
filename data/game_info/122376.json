This is also the first game I've really ever made! It's really short and I had to cut a lot of the content I wanted to add in, but I'll be making a post compo version over the summer so my full vision can be realized! I wasn't able to properly animate everything like I wanted to, nor does it have nearly as many levels as I hoped. It's not all bad though! I learned more about GameMaker in these 48 hours than I have in the six months previous! </p><p>Part of my inspiration for this game was UNDERTALE, by Toby Fox. Thank you for making such an amazing game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0f/d0f2c8c8a6cf057504fb218c2fdf21d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bramble"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
