One player takes control of one of the NPCs on the screen upon input, and their task is to collect the gems before being found. The other player controls the mouse, and their objective is to discern the first player's character from the rest, and to apprehend them. Gems disappear 5 seconds after being touched by a player, giving them some leeway on the second playing finding out that a gem's been stolen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T15:09:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/878/8788a2c2f764093fe157c0eeedae071e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hexfall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
