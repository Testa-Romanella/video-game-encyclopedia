On top of finding golden <strong>eggs</strong>, you find yourself in a maze that has been vandalized by strange personalities, who insist on commenting on your journey and their own woes. How <strong>egg</strong>-noble of them!</p><p>Credits:</p><p>The game is the sole brainchild of yours truly, from music to art to dubious writing and coding. The only external thanks goes to my friends, who were eager to play-test my game and listened to me complain as I realized I had a valid prototype and could probably actually submit something. Also to the many, many Youtube channels whose code I shamelessly borrowed from. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T07:38:43", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Adwen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
