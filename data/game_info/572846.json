Why? Because the gods hate tourists.</strong></p>\n<p>In an attempt to bring back respect to Olympus, the gods must defend their ancient monument sites from becoming defaced and overrun by various tourist types including Jocks, Influencers and Nerds! Survive the waves of tourists until the end and keep an eye on your monuments, or you may stand to lose Olympus itself!</p>\n<p><strong>Genre: </strong>A mixture of RTS (real-time strategy) and Tower Defense.<br/></p>\r\nCharacters:\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>To defend Olympus you can currently play as 3 different gods, each with their own fighting styles and abilities.\r\nOur roster includes:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Ares</strong>\u00a0- a melee fighter who gets hands-on with the enemy. With every bit of damage he takes, he grows more angry and reckless with his attacks.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dionysus\u00a0</strong>- a support-type god who doesn\u2019t hit very hard and can\u2019t take much of a beating, but their ability to draw large crowds of enemies away from the main path is incredibly powerful.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Demeter</strong>- a god who doesn\u2019t care much for fighting tourists directly, but can instead harness the power of the seasons to target monuments and structures instead. She is able to switch between two different forms: Summer - which focuses on healing and defending structures, and Winter - which is more aggressive and focuses on destroying enemy structures.\r\n</p>\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\n\n\n<br/>Credits:\r\n<p>Customizable Skybox Shader by Key Mouse<br/>Clouds by Unity<br/>\u201852 Special Effects Pack\u2019 Particle Pack<br/>Cartoon FX Free Particle Pack\r\nAnimations using Mixamo<br/><strong>BGM: </strong>\u2018Autumn Forest\u2019 by Adrian von Ziegler</p>\r\nTeam:\u00a0\r\n<p>\u201cPixel Peeps\u201d (The Pixel Mill 2020-2021 Bootcamp Dev Team)\r\n</p>\r\nArtists:\r\n\r\n<p>Mia McMorrow<br/>Michael Sloan<br/>Nadine Rose McLaughlin<br/>Patrick Sloan<br/>Rachel Gandey-Johnson</p>\r\nDevelopers:\r\n\r\n<p>Bekah Logan<br/>Daniel Gould<br/>Mat Wylie<br/>Niall McCoy<br/>Ricky Taylor</p>\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n\r\n<p>Rory Clifford<br/>Juan Gabriel Gomila Salas<br/>Alistair Mountain\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>This game has been created as a 5-week game development project funded by Northern Ireland Screen.</em></p>\n<p>Note: macOS Catalina not currently supported</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:51:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f8/6f884073c5519a1294046bf7b77a6db9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Niall McCoy", "Pixel Peeps", "Rachel Gandey-Johnson", "Bekah Logan", "patricksloan", "nadinerosem", "Michael_Sloan", "Daniel Gould", "Rose673", "hollowtaylor", "Mat Wylie"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
