{"id": 52475, "slug": "the-activision-decathlon", "name": "The Activision Decathlon", "name_original": "The Activision Decathlon", "description": "<p>The Activision Decathlon is a sports game written by David Crane for the Atari 2600 and published by Activision in 1983. It was ported to the Atari 8-bit family, Atari 5200, Commodore 64, ColecoVision and MSX platforms. Up to four players compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually.</p>\n<p>The game became somewhat notorious for the amount of wear or damage inflicted upon console controllers, namely the Atari 2600 version where rapid back-and-forth movement of the joystick propels the athlete down the track.</p>\n<p>The game was later reissued simply as Decathlon by the UK budget label Firebird. It was subsequently featured on the PlayStation 2 compilation Activision Anthology.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-16T20:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d33/d338b40d51ffda5316b863c2f5a90464.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Atari 8-bit", "Atari 5200", "Atari 2600", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Activision"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": null}
