You never know who might be out there. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TRAFFIC is about a family living in Wyoming as they traverse through the economic recession of 2008. <strong>You play as the single child in a family of three, along with your Mother and Father. </strong><br/><br/>Experience the gut-wrenching tension and horrifying story of TRAFFIC as you make your way through the days, doing whatever you can to take your mind off of the traumatic events occurring.  <br/><br/>Piece the story together as you notice tiny details within the dialogue and environments. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Huge thanks to Bazookya for creating an entire TV show segment.
