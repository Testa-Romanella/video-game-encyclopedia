{"id": 311365, "slug": "worlds-history-simulator", "name": "Worlds: History Simulator", "name_original": "Worlds: History Simulator", "description": "<p>'Worlds' is a simulator intended to recreate human history all the way from its origins in alternate world settings.</p>\n<p>Current features:</p>\n<ul><li>A 2D cell-based terrain generator that creates continent-based worlds with semi-realistic temperature and rainfall patterns. Biomes, like deserts and forests, are assigned to each cell based on its specific climate.\u00a0</li><li>An alternate 3D globe visualization of the map with a simulated, cosmetic\u00a0day/night cycle.</li><li>A map editor that allows you to modify the terrain in multiple ways: Offset the global seal levels, temperatures and global rainfall. Or use a brush to tweaks individual attributes on each cell.</li><li>Humanity starts from a single place\u00a0on the map, either chosen by you or random, and spreads all over the world, adapting along the way to the diverse environments.</li><li>Populations in different places grow and evolve,\u00a0diverging socially and technologically over time under the influence of environmental factors and interactions with other cultures.</li><li>Population groups can join and form basic political and territorial entities (polities). Each which might in turn develop its own language and culture.</li><li>Multiple map modes and overlays that will allow you to observe how human groups differ from each other on multiple aspects, from population densities to cultural attributes and technological advancements.</li><li>You can take over polity factions and have some level of influence on events that happen to them.</li></ul>\n<p>Planned features (see also\u00a0roadmap):</p>\n<ul><li>World Generation:<ul><li>Add oceanic current.\u00a0These will have an effect on climates, fishing and maritime routes.</li><li>Add drainage basins that will give raise to, rivers, aquifers and associated biomes.</li><li>Add geological/planetary events: volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, climate change, etc.</li><li>Add more customizable world generation parameters, templates and modding.</li><li>Add the ability to import custom world maps and population/polity setups.</li><li>Add support for bigger/smaller worlds.</li></ul></li><li>History Simulation:<ul><li>Add more production activities like fishing, herding, crafting.</li><li>Add cultural values to societies which will influence how different human groups behave, evolve and interact with each other.</li><li>Add more abstract cultural identification/separation mechanics (art, social customs, sports).</li><li>Add cults/religions which might expand and influence societies.</li><li>Add population centers (villages, towns, cities) to which populations will migrate and where more complex production systems (industries) can evolve.</li><li>Add a more robust agricultural system where different crops can be planted and harvested, and different animals can be domesticated and exploited.</li><li>Add to polities more complex politics, different forms of government and different social structures (ie. clan systems, caste/class based societies, egalitarian societies).</li><li>Add diplomatic interactions between polities: conflicts, treaties, alliances, etc.</li><li>Add trading routes between cities and polities.</li><li>Add modding for cultural attributes, political systems and events.</li></ul></li><li>User Interface:<ul><li>Add the ability to zoom into regions/polities.</li><li>Add more and improved visualization overlays and views.</li><li>Add data graphs and a history log viewer.</li><li>Add a 3D globe view.</li></ul></li><li>Music/SFX:<ul><li>Add basic UI sounds.</li><li>Add a procedural music generator that creates music tailored to individual cultures.</li></ul></li><li>User/Player Interactions:<ul><li>Improve a player's ability to take control/influence individual polities.</li><li>Add the ability to 'time-travel' to arbitrary periods in a world's past without the necessity to load a save.</li><li>Add an in-engine timelapse viewer/player.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Follow the development blog:\u00a0http://humanity-worlds.squarespace.com/blog</p>\n<p>Join the subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldhistorysim/</p>\n<p>Support the project on Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/DrTardigrade</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:41:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84c/84cc4cfe7fa2381fda6966bd257367ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DrTardigrade"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
