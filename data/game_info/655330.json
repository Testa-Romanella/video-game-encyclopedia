On collision with the vaccine the virus will be <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0neutralized and become attached to the vaccine to prevent it from infecting healthy cells. The more viruses you collect the <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0longer the chain attached to the vaccine will become making movement more difficult interesting ; )</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I started out by incorporating physics into the original video game\u00a0and then iterated through ideas to create some variations in design and mechanics based on the physics.\u00a0 Each game can be started from the start screen in any order (but I suggest playing them in the order below to build up some practice). Sorry, but the start screen is quite empty sparse for now, so just imagine some beautiful title artwork and some animated vaccines bouncing around ; )<br/></p>\n<strong>Classic Mode</strong>Collect each virus (green dot) as it appears to form the longest chain you possibly can without\u00a0 colliding into the boundary or any part of the chain.<br/><strong>Speed Run</strong>Collect all viruses (green dots) in the quickest time possible while always avoiding\u00a0contact with the boundary or any part of\u00a0the chain.<strong>Speed Chase</strong><br/>Same as 'Speed Run' but you'll have to chase down the viruses as they move around. In addition you must also not collide with any healthy blood cells (red dots).<strong>Challenge Mode</strong>You must try to group together (in the quickest time possible) anti-bodies (light blue circles) so that they are in contact with each other.\u00a0 If the vaccine (white dot) collides with an anti-body one virus from the chain\u00a0will be dislodged and appear as a\u00a0yellow dot. You can collect these again to lengthen the chain.\u00a0\r\n<p>Each game will automatically save your best score so you can try to beat it when you play again.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>I experimented with a few control schemes and found that a rotational one worked best. It takes a bit of practice to get used to (so be patient) but works much better than directional controls.\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Z</strong>\r\nRotate the vaccine\u00a0counter clockwise.\u00a0<strong>X</strong>Rotate the vaccine\u00a0clockwise.\r\n<p>If you're really not convinced with the rotational controls and want to test for yourself press F2 at any time to switch to\u00a0directional (WASD) controls. Then press F2 to switch back when you're convinced I'm right\u00a0;\u00a0)</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<strong>Artwork</strong>Ivan Kapustin<strong>Music</strong><br/>Benjamin Burns<br/><strong>Sounds</strong>Juhani Junkala", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fd/7fd4f0aff4d16fe3b101cbb7b52c3d1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itizso"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
