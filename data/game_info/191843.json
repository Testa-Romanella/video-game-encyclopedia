To begin, players enter their name and choose the character that looks most like them. For this prototype version of the game, we have developed five characters. We imagine a fully-realized version of the game to provide a much\u00a0broader range of identities to choose from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once your character is selected, you're off on your Big Apple adventure, choosing from four main activities that include visits to Times Square and the Statue of Liberty.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created by Kate Womby Browne using Twine 2.2.1 in collaboration with artist Julia Womby. All images were either drawn by Julia or were sourced from Noun\u00a0Project, with Photoshop work by Kate.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our light-hearted approach to customized digital storytelling\u00a0and welcome your feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e09d36090346eadb5e01890e780eb12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kwom"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
