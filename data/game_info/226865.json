Try to place as many tiles on the board as possible, keeping in mind only two simple rules: your tiles must touch a corner of one of your previously placed tiles, but they must not share an edge. Can you play more tiles than your opponents? <br/><br/><br/>RULES:<br/>Each player has 21 tiles: 12 tiles with 5 squares, 5 tiles with 4 squares, 2 tiles with 3 squares, 1 tile with 2 squares and 1 tile with 1 square. <br/>Players take turns in placing one tile onto the 20x20 board. The first tile for each player has to be placed in their corner of the board. Each following tile has to touch a corner of one of your previous tiles, but it must never share an edge. It may share edges with the opponents' tiles though. <br/>If a player has no more possible move, they have to pass. The game is over when no player can place a tile. <br/>For each player, the squares of all their tiles on the board are added up. Finishing a game with all stones placed on the board gives a 15 points bonus. If the monomino is placed last, you will get a 20 points bonus. The player with the most points  wins. <br/><br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>\u2022\u2003 Swipe the list of available tiles with your finger. <br/>\u2022\u2003 Select and drag a tile onto the board. <br/>\u2022\u2003 Rotate the stone using one of the 4 handles. <br/>\u2022\u2003 To flip a stone, slide your finger from one handle toward the opposing handle.<br/>\u2022\u2003 Place the tile in the desired position. The tile will appear green if the position is valid, and red otherwise. Possible corners are highlighted on the board for convenience. <br/>\u2022\u2003 Tap the tile in a valid position to place it. <br/>\u2022\u2003 You can rotate the board at any time to see the opponents' tiles. <br/><br/>Quit the app at any time, your current game will be saved and restored on next start. <br/><br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>\u2022\u2003 Supports 2-player modes, with 2 colors (Original and Blokus Duo), 4 colors (2 each).<br/>\u2022\u2003 Customizable board sizes other than 20x20.<br/>\u2022\u2003 Play against the computer or humans on the same device. <br/>\u2022\u2003 Play online against your friends<br/>\u2022\u2003 Multiplayer via Bluetooth<br/>\u2022\u2003 Hint and undo options<br/>\u2022\u2003 Leaderboards and Achievements (Google Play Games)<br/>\u2022\u2003 Looks great on tablets, too!<br/><br/>The game is network-compatible with Freebloks 3D for Windows and Linux: http://www.saschahlusiak.de/freebloks-3d/ <br/><br/><br/>PLEASE DONATE:<br/>Freebloks 3D is absolutely free, open source and without advertisement!
