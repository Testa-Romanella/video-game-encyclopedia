{"id": 896103, "slug": "bagged", "name": "Bagged!", "name_original": "Bagged!", "description": "<p>\"Bagged!\" is a lawnmowing prototype/WIP I did earlier this year (2022). It <em>may</em> eventually be expanded into something more (i.e. designed environments, a selection of machines and/or upgrades, various\u00a0characters to unlock/pick from/customize, different kinds of crops to harvest etc.).</p>\n<p>Controls are simple - by default, WASD to move and when you fill up a bag, hold left mouse button to boost.\u00a0 Also can hold down middle mouse button to turn in place (turn the mower without moving forward).\u00a0Controls are remappable and gamepads are supported.</p><p>Mow efficiently to increase the combo gauge. Efficiency momentum is lost by mowing places you've already mowed (or dirt, the street, out of bounds, etc.), and lost even more quickly by mowing through flowers/gardens.</p><p>This game features Deferred Multiplayer - creating a\u00a0profile is\u00a0free and anonymous. Sign in to\u00a0compete on the leaderboard and let others play alongside a replay of your best attempt. Players from\u00a0Casual Racing\u00a0and/or\u00a0Tower Offense\u00a0may\u00a0use their existing profile here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:57:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60a505f8d5273d7292819f6133ab54fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adam Golden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
