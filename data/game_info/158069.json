It looks very simple but the main goal was to carry out some idea to the end in short time. You can find this game on many websites with flash games or you can watch a video of the gampeplay.</p><p>Design of this shooter was inspired by the classic Space Invaders. Like in my other flash games I used Flixel as a framework and Gimp to prepare some graphics. It's playable and even you can try to complete it by breaking through 100 waves of enemies. There are 10 kind of invaders each with different behaviour. Every 5 levels you will get an extra live which is very helpful. Music made by Kevin MacLeod suits very well to the action.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b9639ecadae752f5e400239ebad515a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gregoryprogrammer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
