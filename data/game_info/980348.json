You can prepare different recipes on different counters and send them to customers. The most important thing you should pay attention to is to serve every customer on time! If you waste too much time, customers will leave the restaurant without taking their orders. This is a kitchen game where time management is also important!<br/><br/><strong><h3>TROLL YOUR FRIEND</h3></strong><br/><br/><strong>You can steal the food your friends take away while they're trying to rush an order.</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>You can slap the shit out of your friends when they're trying to fulfill an order.</strong><br/><br/><br/><strong>You can turn your friends into animals when they're trying to order.</strong><br/><br/><strong><h3>UPGRADE YOUR RESTAURANT</h3></strong><br/><br/>This cooking game PC also includes light RPG elements: you start at level 1 and with a limited number of counters \u2013 recipes. As you satisfy your restaurant's customers and level up, you gain access to more counters and more recipes. But be careful, as customers become more impatient as the restaurant level increases! Try the cooking games genre with new mechanics: as you move up, customers' expectations also increase!<br/><br/><strong><h3>A COOKING GAME WITH MULTIPLE COUNTERS AND RECIPES</h3></strong><br/><br/>This cooking simulator has 19 different counters, and 19 recipes are waiting for you at each one. You can prepare different dishes at the counters such as donuts, drinks, ice creams, burgers, and fries. And don't forget that you'll need ingredients for each of these recipes: you should always keep your restaurant's stock full by ordering frequently! Play with your friends and prepare a different dish at each counter! As your restaurant levels up, you can unlock new abilities!<br/><br/><strong><h3>MAKE SURE CUSTOMERS LEAVE SATISFIED</h3></strong><br/><br/>Kitchen games usually focus only on recipes, but here you also need to pay attention to time management. Every customer has a patience counter: it starts from the moment they sit at the table, and you must serve their food before it ends. Otherwise, they'll walk out of the restaurant, and you won't make any money! You must make sure that a certain number of customers eat a certain number of meals every day. You need to focus not only on restaurant management, but also on fast service and customer satisfaction!<br/><br/><strong><ul><h3>KEY FEATURES</h3></ul></strong><br/><ul><li> A restaurant that can be upgraded: Each level will unlock new challenges<br/></li><li> Different counters, different recipes: There are 19 different counters in your restaurant where you can cook different dishes, and each contains 19 different recipes<br/></li><li> Order ingredients, manage your restaurant: You must order the ingredients needed for your recipes: Make sure your stock is always full!<br/></li><li> Play with friends: This is a coop kitchen game\u2013 it supports co-op play for up to 4 people!<br/></li><li> Test your speed: Try to serve every customer before their patience level runs out!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:54:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73f/73f9e2b96ed33d3dd60c58223df5f036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Musa GUNGOR"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Musa GUNGOR"], "esrb_rating": null}
