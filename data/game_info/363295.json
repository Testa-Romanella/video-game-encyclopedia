Your playing field is a randomized mix of nine symbols in 1-9 levels. But wait - there's more than just symbols - you will need to stay focused and here's what I mean.<br/><br/>Random symbols might be rotating and this rotation increases as you progress through the levels. Want more of a focus challenge? The entire board will randomly rotate and/or flip! Stay focused and go for the fastest completion time possible.<br/><br/>From the start, pick a level by touching the difficulty icon then click the \"Play Level ?\" button at the bottom. When you see the play board the currently active symbols are displayed at the bottom. Touch one of the symbols then touch the board to place it in an empty space. If there is a collision with another like symbol it will turn red, else it will appear as green.<br/><br/>Local device scores are kept for the top 10 for each level and if you complete the puzzle your score will be checked with the global database and you will see your level scores and the global scores on the summary page.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>Watch it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIUymjwHkNw", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T07:05:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c6aa923aab69e8e179b2dce1c7788b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["David Lovison"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["David Lovison"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
