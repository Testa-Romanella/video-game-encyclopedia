They hauled people and cargo to their destinations all day, but when the time came for each to go home, they suddenly realized they were completely and utterly lost.<br/><br/>They each knew that their home is of the same color as they themselves were, but, alas, they just couldn\u2019t find a way back.<br/><br/>And so, as they set out on their long homeward journey, they seek your help and guidance in reaching their destinations.
