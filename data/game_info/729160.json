Now you must take care of IT.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This game was made in 16 days for <strong>Team Dogpit's Virtual Pet Jam.</strong></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n\n<ul><li>Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move;</li><li>Left Mouse Button to interact;</li><li>Left Shift or Right Mouse Button to run;</li><li>Space to jump;</li><li>Esc to pause.</li></ul>\n\r\nSome Useful Tips\r\n<ul><li>In the supermarket levels, some items may bug and disappear.

There are some things in the project that we couldn't put in time for the jam (like footsteps). We might update this at some point and maybe even make more levels (or at least the ones we were planning from the very beginning and aren't in the Jam Version). The Brazilian Portuguese translation may be the next update.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Filipe Galv\u00e3o</strong> - 50% of development, art, writing (https://twitter.com/FilipeGalvaoDev)</p>\n<p><strong>\u00cdtalo Oliveira</strong> - 50% of development (https://twitter.com/Pitch01492841)</p>\n\r\nAssets not made by Supernatural Stardust:\r\n<p>Adventure Creator by Chris Burton (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/adventure-creator-1189...)</p>\n<p>Haunted PSX Render Pipeline by Nicholas Brancaccio (https://github.com/pastasfuture/com.hauntedpsx.render-pipelines.psx)</p>\n<p>Soundtrack (Crystal Cola, Slice of Paradise, The Devils Eyes) by Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio (https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteBatAudio)</p>\n<p>Chewing SFX by 3maze (https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc - 2018 Bundle)</p>\n<p>Portal SFX by Phil Michalski (https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc - 2019 Bundle)</p>\n<p>Ice Cream Script Font by Igor Grovich - (https://befonts.com/ice-cream-script-font.html)<br/></p>\r\nTextures and/or images from:\r\n<p>https://www.cgbookcase.com/</p>\n<p>https://ambientcg.com/</p>\n<p>https://www.freeimages.com/</p>\n<p>https://unsplash.com/</p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T11:09:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec0/ec01b3caf3a2ffab47897b395dcac101.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supernatural Stardust"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
