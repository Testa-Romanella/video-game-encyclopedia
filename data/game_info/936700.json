{"id": 936700, "slug": "shifty-fields", "name": "Shifty Fields", "name_original": "Shifty Fields", "description": "<p>Your peaceful life as a farmer is shattered by an invasion from outer space. Search the maze in the fields around your base to collect weapons, building supplies and ammunition to fight off the alien robots. Every night, the maze shifts, leaving you to search a new procedurally-generated maze in the morning for new, stronger equipment. Venture deep into the maze to find the highest-level gear and build your base to protect against the aliens, but don't get lost in the maze at night!</p><p>The aim of the game is to survive as long as possible by fortifying your field (the open space where you started). To fortify your base, you have to collect wood (found in the maze) and metal (found in the maze but also from killing enemies). When in your field press <strong>B</strong> to open the build menu, click on an item, then click to place. Press <strong>R</strong> to rotate an item, and press right click or <strong>Esc </strong>when you are done placing. The controls are WASD and use your mouse to point you character. In the daytime, all enemies are beamed up to space, so the maze is safe to explore. However, in the night time, it is very common that you will get swarmed in the maze, so you probably want to defend from the field. You can pick up guns around the maze (the more days you survive the better the guns will be). Guns need ammo (bottom left of screen when holding a gun). Ammo can also be found around the maze. Swords are powerful weapons, don't underestimate them. You can use a sword by clicking. If you hold right click with a sword, it will block. Blocking will deflect all bullets and prevent any damage from being taken. All weapons have durability (number of shots/slices before the weapon breaks). The durability can be visualised by looking at how red the background of a weapon is in the status bar. The more red, the closer to breaking. Med kits can be found around the map. They go into your inventory. To use them, select the med kit and click. This will revitalise you.</p><br/>\n<p><em><em>Open-source:\u00a0https://github.com/carlpilot/Climax-Game-Jam-2023</em></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T07:06:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2c6cb60fd536d54b9479d84134d8ac2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["carlpilot"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
