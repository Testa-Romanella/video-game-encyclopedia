The story revolves around two resistance groups that fight for different goals and in different parts of the planet. They eventually get together and cooperate. Enkies are able to time travel, so the story is set in different timelines both in the past and the future. </p>\n<p>Every level of the game has to be completed before the time limit expires. Players gain more time by destroying enemy targets and lose time for getting hit. There are multiple weapons in the game such as seeker missiles and energy beams. The players can slow down time. Powerups are also scattered around the levels which increase the rate of fire or replenish ammo. There are 18 bosses featured in Sine Mora. The players have to figure out the weak spots and the tactics of their enemy in order to pass the level.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2012-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T22:12:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c2/9c24c4e02fcfc6838df00858a4d11cce.jpg", "website": "http://www.sinemoragame.com/", "rating": 3.31, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 52, "owned": 1327, "beaten": 44, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 66, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 58, "ratings_count": 129, "suggestions_count": 454, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 130, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "Android", "PlayStation 3", "PS Vita", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["THQ Nordic", "Handy Games", "Grasshopper Manufacture", "Digital Reality"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "Nordic Games", "www.handy-games.com", "HandyGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
