That\u2019s right, the one where it\u2019s the middle of November except everyone is already thinking about the Holiday. So, \"Santa\" is forced to deliver his presents earlier than ever before. But because he\u2019s doing it so much earlier, all the other holiday icons are pissed, and they\u2019re out for blood. It\u2019s your job to ensure that every child in every continent on the planet gets their presents. I know what you\u2019re thinking. Yes, \"Santa\" is even going to Antarctica this year. It\u2019s time for you to put on your Santa hat, grab those presents, eat every cookie, and shove the holiday spirit right down everyone\u2019s chimneys.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits: November Jammers</strong></p>\n<p>Ryan Bahmanyar<br/>Davis Canby\u00a0<br/>Penny Lewis\u00a0<br/>Ethan Bowen\u00a0<br/>Jessica Bailey\u00a0<br/>Luke Vincent\r\n<br/>\r\nJames Youngblood\r\n<br/>\r\nThomas Roberts\r\n<br/>\r\nVincent Levy\r\n<br/>\r\nArjun Shivakumar\r\n<br/>\r\nCarson Shea\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS:<br/></strong>\r\nUniversity of Utah<br/>\r\nGameCraft\r\n<br/>\r\nFreesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T07:18:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bc/9bcce781d668df18500a8ea602a3abed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thom-Roberts"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
