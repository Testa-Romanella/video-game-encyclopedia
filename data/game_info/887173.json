I had just started a course on game development so he joked about how I should make the next MGS game but legally distinct. \"Iron Cogwheel Sturdy\" became an inside joke of ours for a while but then it faded away... Until now. As a birthday gift I developed this parody game in secret and now it is available to the public!</p>\n<p>The game also features some sick legally distinct tunes by Joakim \"Klagarn\" Jansson! You can check out the entire soundtrack here!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T14:37:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a2798bc8554b2066e56622f221a7623b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Borari"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
