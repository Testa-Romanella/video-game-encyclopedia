{"id": 736266, "slug": "demon-front", "name": "Demon Front", "name_original": "Demon Front", "description": "<p>Demon Front (Chinese: \u9b54\u57df\u6230\u7dda; pinyin: M\u00f3y\u00f9 Zh\u00e0nxi\u00e0n) is a side-scrolling run and gun arcade game released in 2002 by International Games System. It shares many characteristics with the Metal Slug series.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is similar to Metal Slug and other run and gun games. It lacks the vehicles that were an element of Metal Slug.</p>\n<p>In addition, there are some unique features in the game. Each of the four characters brings along a pet, which can be sent to attack enemies or used as a shield. There are three buttons: Shoot, jump, and shield. Holding the shoot button charges the player&#39;s pet, and when released the pet launches a stationary devastating attack for a few seconds. The shield button converts the pet into a shield that is permanent - until players press the button again or it takes enough damage to disappear. Melee attacks and pet attacks release hearts which boost their shield power.</p>\n<p>Characters include Jake and Sara, two regular humans from Earth. Dr. J, a scientist, and Maya an ape. All characters largely play the same.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-22T07:13:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9af/9afbfe848100a47c6ffb7a87ecc23de8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": [], "developers": [], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
