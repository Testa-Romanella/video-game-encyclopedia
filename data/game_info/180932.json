Here it is! I actually did it so I'm proud of me.</p><p>This was a concept I've been kicking around a while and I sort of jumped on the Game Jam to finally force myself to work on it. Definitely not one of my best works but like I said, first time ever making something like this so I'm not even gonna remotely attempt to dump on myself. There's a lot of images that aren't in this game as a heads up, so don't worry about the grey screens when you bump into them.</p><p>I'd originally planned to do more but ran into some serious time constraints due to juggling other projects alongside a 9-5 job. Still, proud of myself for finally making a game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2d/b2dca95fc97a890eacd8dc6c00181118.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Moronis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
