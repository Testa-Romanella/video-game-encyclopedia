{"id": 712677, "slug": "summer-numbers", "name": "Summer Numbers", "name_original": "Summer Numbers", "description": "Summer Numbers is a challenging and fun puzzle game to relax after a busy day. The rules of the games are simple: at the beginning of each level a random board is generated with both positive (green) and negative (red) numbers. The goal is to obtain more points than your opponent. The twist is that you can only move horizontally while your opponent can only move vertically, so always picking the highest possible number is not a winning strategy. The game ends when there is no possible legal move. This happens either when there is no number left on the board, but also when either player is on an empty row (player 1) or column (player 2).<br/><br/>You can play against the AI (which will get harder at every level) or with a friend (locally, on the same computer). After winning each level a beautiful hand-drawn watercolor/marker illustration is shown. The game is realized in a retro style reminiscent of the '90s era.<h3>Instructions</h3><strong>Keyboard layout</strong><br/><strong>Arrow keys, WASD</strong>: navigate menus, move cursor<br/><strong>Enter/space</strong>: select<br/><strong>M</strong>: toggle music<br/><strong>F</strong>: toggle fullscreen<br/><strong>Q</strong>: quit<br/><strong>Esc</strong>: skip slideshow<br/><br/><strong>Controller layout</strong><br/><strong>D-pad</strong>: navigate menus, move cursor<br/><strong>A or B button</strong>: select<br/><strong>Y button</strong>: toggle music<br/><strong>Back button</strong>: quit<br/><strong>X button</strong>: skip slideshow<h3>Technical info</h3><strong>The info in this section is for curious users and retro gamers. The game can be launched and played normally like any other game you get on Steam.</strong><br/><br/>Summer Numbers is not just made to look and feel like a retro game, it is developed like one. It can run on PCs starting from the late 486 era. If you have a retro PC and want to admire 256-color art on your CRT monitor, you can find a bootable disk image in the installation folder. This image file can be flashed to a HD, compact flash (if you use a CF-IDE adapter) or even USB drive if your PC supports booting from it. The game has actually its own bootloader and works as an OS (runs in 32-bit protected mode) and does not require (nor bundles) any other OS.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T04:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db3/db32185962217ed630e54b0305568775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bitgamma OU"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bitgamma OU"], "esrb_rating": null}
