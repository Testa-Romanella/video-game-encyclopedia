Thank you for playing or looking at my game, \"Travelers\".<br/><br/>The story of this game began in 2014. As a student major in game development, I played Lucas Pope's \"Paper, Please\" which is the Grand Prize of IGF 2014. Solo-development, unordinary topic, inspiration from LudumDare, mechanism-driven, 20+ year industry experience, this game and its developer bring so many labels that inspire me. I felt that I could answer a question that I\u2019ve been asked countless times since I was a child but I had never been able <br/>to answer seriously, \"Who is your idol?\"<br/><br/>In May 2019, I created a Unity project called \"travellers\". Since then, I used my free time to start building and exploring a simulation game about travel using \"set collection\" as its core mechanic. Time flies. In 2021, \"travellers\" became \"\u65c5\u8005Travelers\". It is no longer what I imagined in 2019, but it has become its own complete form as a game. It is time to let it meet more players...<br/><br/>\"\u65c5\u8005Travelers\" is the beginning of my journey, not the end. \u2014\u2014 \u9605\u5c18Atlas in 2021", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T02:46:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/66786ed07138d5c6b5970db5bfda10a4.jpg", "website": "https://space.bilibili.com/326273588", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["\u9605\u5c18Atlas"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u9605\u5c18Atlas"], "esrb_rating": null}
