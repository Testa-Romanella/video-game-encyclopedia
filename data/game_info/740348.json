Play length: Around an hour per play-through.<br/><br/><strong>What is SkyE about?</strong></p>\n<p>SkyE is a light sim-like game where you play the role of Celeste, a graduate Sky Knight who is taken on her final ranking assignment with her teacher, Knight Commander Svarus. You will be investigating the Rayth outbreak that has only begun at the newest Chromadus Academy for Raye Engineers and Directors. The game heavily centers around real-time shmup style side-scrolling combat.<br/><br/><strong>What's unique about SkyE?</strong><br/><br/>SkyE plays something like a sim, you'll be able to choose which locations to investigate at certain times of the day, uncovering the plot that haunts the new school. As you play you'll be thrown into a side-scrolling action system that mixes a brawler with a shooter to create a new unique style of gameplay. (Buzzword BINGO!)<br/><br/>Once you finish the game you'll find yourself able to play it over again; it will take a few times through to uncover all the different secrets and see the real answers to what's going on.<br/><br/>SkyE is developed entirely in RPG Maker VX from scratch starting from September 10th, completed on November 1st!<br/><br/>The combat system features pixel-checking collision for bullets, so moving your character around and flying forward through a wave of bullets is actually pretty fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T07:07:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/254/254d18c6bc6b5ac99e181fed49e44c88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaskedIntrovert"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
