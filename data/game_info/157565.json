Collect as many coins as you can, while keeping your health as high as possible. Enemys chase you and shoot at you. If your health runs out you can escape into the clouds on the side to keep your coins and refresh your health, at a price: enemys will now spawn faster and faster. Control the game using left and right arrow keys to turn, and spamming the up arrow to shoot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e3fa16b354a12c4e7c512ca50b55b78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AidanYtgr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
