There was always something I couldn't fix so I needed to make some research, or I couldn't just code some features myself and I needed help, and for the most features, I tried coding myself, so I got very stressed. I'm a developer, not a designer. If you find bugs, just leave them in the comments. I didn't work at this game at home, but on a crappy computer, not that it couldn't run the engine, but it was slow at around 25 FPS. You'll probably ask me \"How do you know then if the engine is goodly optimized?\" Well, trust me.\u00a0By the way, if you're reading this, good job. Now you know, I will add controller support in the future. This game uses Nightlighter Engine Beta, a game engine coded in C++, but the game was coded in C#.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/214904b5e45e1a3a8f73a54fd7a53d8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Futuresoft"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
