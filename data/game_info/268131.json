Again, I apologize for my artwork and music in the game, because I am not very god at them and I did not have much time.</p>\n<p>Wasteland is a nice, few minutes experience in which you have to shoot enemies of different types that will try to kill you. Use WASD to move and your mouse to aim and shoot. Have fun and leave some comments!</p>\n<p>Thanks again to\u00a0 Blackthornprod (and his brother) for all the free (and not so free, in this case)\u00a0content they have published which helps other people start their game creation journeys.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/833/8335b5c1d463901f21a27d221ae5a4b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Delthor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
