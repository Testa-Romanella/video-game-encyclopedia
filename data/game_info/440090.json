Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands for the Wii also features some bonus content, such as unlockable in-game character skins, art galleries, developer diaries, bonus levels, and the original 1992 version of Prince of Persia. The game is popularly referred to as having last generation graphics and dull combat, but was generally praised for its unique and creative gameplay mechanics as well as its overall strong production values, including its unique storyline.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2010-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T10:57:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55c/55c45c9d92e990f066be3523e033b9b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 368, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": ["Ubisoft Montreal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
