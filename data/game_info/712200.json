But with magic\u00a0</p>\n<p>you can turn the tables. You can a turn into a Voodoo and then turn your opponent's strength against themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In other words, you can lose (take damage deliberately in voodoo mode) in order to win (kill your opponents)!</p>\n<p>GamePlay:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your objective is to escape the enemy infested map through the portal.</p>\n<p>Your main weapon is the VooDoo pin which can be used to pin your enemy, you can damage that particular enemy</p>\n<p>by getting hit by the arrow that is shot by that particular enemy. Getting hit by other enemy will damage\u00a0</p>\n<p>yourself. Each VooDoo pin can last a duration of 5 second once it is stuck onto an enemy, make good use\u00a0</p>\n<p>of this time to get hit by that particular enemy struck by the VooDoo pin.</p>\n<p>In this game, there are four different enemies shown with different tint (green, red, blue, yellow).\u00a0</p>\n<p>They have different behaviour and are always in patrol mode until when the player get close to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Green - Melee only. (Starts chasing player within a distance)</p>\n<p>- Blue - Shooting only. (Within a certain distance from player, it will start moving closer to player\u00a0</p>\n<p> before stopping and shooting.)</p>\n<p>- Red - Melee &amp; Shooting. (Within a certain distance from player, it will start moving closer to player\u00a0</p>\n<p> before stopping and shooting. If the player move any closer to it, it will start moving close to the\u00a0</p>\n<p> player and attack player with melee).</p>\n<p>- Yellow - Shooting only. (Will chase player all the time).</p>\n<p>Enemies can be pushed away if you are being cornered or unable to run away from enemy. Some objects like boxes\u00a0are movable which can be moved out of the way to clear the path or used as a shield!</p>\n<p>Damaging a say red enemy will also inflict damage to all other red enemies in the game.</p>\n<p>If your pin intercepts with an enemies' arrow, the enemies arrow will overpower your pin making it useless, so time your shot correctly!</p>\n<p>Attribution:</p>\n<p>- Player Art Asset: https://gamekrazzy.itch.io/8-direction-top-down-character</p>\n<p>- Environment Art Asset: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/pixel-art-top-down-basic-1...</p>\n<p>- Icon Art Asset: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/pixel-art-icon-pack-rpg-15834...</p>\n<p>- 2D Navmesh: https://unitylist.com/p/hqq/Nav-Mesh-Plus</p>\n<p>- VooDoo Menu Art: https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/voodoo-doll (lavarmsg)</p>\n<p>- VooDoo Level Selection Art: https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/voodoo-doll (zhengdacool)</p>\n<p>- Menu Music: https://pixabay.com/music/modern-classical-the-introvert-michael-kobrin-10959/</p>\n<p>- In Game Music: https://pixabay.com/music/main-title-chasing-victory-main-9448/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T08:41:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/205/205574dd7c940fa225260a42d99c8418.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MinHeinA", "WHYELAB"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
