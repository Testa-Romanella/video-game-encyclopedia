Work as a team in this two player game, and help your human escape the city to live free.

The platform will be be destroyed if it hits a rooftop, so be sure to fire the laser in a clear area.<br/></p><p>Or, play as a one player game if you are feeling confident :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:24:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/437/43705c677b3e15c542e67b7c5fbd13d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sgtwombatstudios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
