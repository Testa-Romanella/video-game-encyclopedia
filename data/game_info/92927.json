Last year for Low Rez Jam, I made <strong>Mr. Knucklehead</strong>. That was a great experience, but this year I wanted to do something a little darker. I wanted a game with blood, demons, magic, and all the good stuff. I also wanted really tight controls, with fast-paced wall jumping and dashing. In that regard, I think Demon's Hymn is a success! Special thanks to\u00a0<strong>Charlie McCarron</strong> for his fantastic work on the music.</p>\n<p>My initial plans for the game were a lot bigger. Bet you haven't heard that before! I wanted the player to go through the church basement and fight a priest at the end. The priest would then call upon his dark god and become a demon, and cast you far out of the church, across the land. The game would be a Castlevania-esque adventure as you trek back to the church, slaying newly-awoken demons along the way.</p>\n<p>As ambitious as that scope is for a game jam, I think I could have done it if I didn't have <strong>2D Con</strong> right smack dab in the middle of the jam! Since that took a lot of time, I ended up working right down to the last minute trying to cram as much content as I could into Demon's Hymn. It ended up with a \"second quest\" sort of thing- after you beat the boss, you find yourself going through the same level, with some different graphics and more challenging enemy placement. Then it's topped off with a harder iteration of the priest boss.</p>\n<p>So I guess what I'm trying to say is... I'm not sure if I'm done with this game! I'm currently working on <strong>Atmocopter</strong>, my main project. But I'm gonna need something to work on next. <strong>So if you like the Demon's Hymn prototype, and if you're lovin' how I described the rest of the game above, let me know in the comments! I might consider this concept for a full game.</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and happy demon-slaying!</p>\n<p>- Will (Demon's Hymn programmer and artist)</p>\n<em>CHANGELOG</em>\n<p><strong><em>--Version 1.01--</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Critical bug fix for final boss.</li><li>Made final boss slightly harder.</li><li>Smoother transition after you beat the first boss.</li><li>Fixed drawing issue with wizard and boss fireballs.</li><li>Enabled automatic update support.</li><li>Added credits.</li><li>Increased window size from 512x512 to 768x768.
