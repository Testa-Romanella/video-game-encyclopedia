Time to find all the possible excuses to delay it!</p>\n<p>Play by interacting with objects from the dressing room, combining them to earn time! Move the camera using the keyboard (a-d or arrows).</p>\n<p>To\u00a0<strong>combine objects</strong>, click on one object, then on the button \u201ccombine with\u201d, then another one. There are also combinations with 3 objects, so click on a first object, then \u201ccombine with\u201d, then on a second object, then \u201ccombine with\u201d, then on a third object! If you see new button appearing on the last object, then you find a new combination!</p>\n<p>If you don't hear songs in the html5 version, please get the downloadable windows one :)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Kate: UX Designer/UI Artist/Narrative Designer\u00a0</li><li>Mojette/Ombremonde: 3D Artist\u00a0</li><li>Lulu: 3D Artist/Singer</li><li>Alexandre: Composer/Sound Designer</li><li>Edwige: Game programmer\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T14:21:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/570/5707770151a1742977e00e723c03f56e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["EDWIGE", "katescapedsgn", "Alexandre Demode"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
