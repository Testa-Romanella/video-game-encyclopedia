In a run the player will have to go through three areas that are split into two stages, so six stages in total. The goal of the game is to defeat the final boss that is found at the end of the last stage, without dying on the way.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0If the player dies at any point during a run, they will be sent back to the hub world, where they need to then start a new attempt to beat the game. The player will find various upgrades during a run that make them stronger and allow for more creative use of the mechanics offered by the game, these upgrades will only last for the current run.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>In this game you will be a wizard, so instead of attacking using swords and bows, you will be using various elemental spells to deal with your enemies.\u00a0Most of these spells can also combine when used together, in order to do special effects that are more useful than just the basic spell.\u00a0All of the spells will have cooldowns, so you will not be able to just use them repeatedly.\u00a0You will need to use your resources wisely to get the most out of your spells.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Our website-\u00a0https://huntformagic.ticorporate.fi</p>\n<p>Twitter-\u00a0https://twitter.com/Hunt4magic</p>\n<p>Youtube- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTMdXRGNkMZgWrklUpWu4FQ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T11:27:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a6/1a635cd49bd02390929a690d25121766.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hunt4magic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
