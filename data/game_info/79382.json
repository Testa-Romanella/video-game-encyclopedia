This survival and open world game will set you into a realistic simulation of the insect world. Discover a huge and detailed map populated by different kinds of other insects and watch the swarm behaviour of a complex ant colony with different castes (worker, scouts, soldiers, males, larvae).<br/><br/>Build a deep underground ant nest by digging new chambers and tunnels! Create chambers with a different kind of purpose (food storage, larvae chamber or queen chamber). Once your colony has enough worker ants you can accelerate the digging phase.<br/><br/>Search for food resources in order to feed the ant queen ant and the larvae to let them pupate and transform into a new ant. Once you found a food source you can create pheromone trails to\u00a0<br/>attract other ants or just command the ants directly to follow you. <br/><br/>But beware of large spiders and praying mantises that are ill-disposed to your colony.<br/>Enforce attacks to overwhelm larger insects with the power of the swarm! <br/><br/><br/>Ant Simulation 3D | Function Overview:<br/><br/>- 3d simulator and open world game<br/>- very realistic ant behaviour (ant trails, pheromone communication and different castes)<br/>   -&gt; Ant AI (watch their swarm behaviour, see how they create pheromone trails)<br/>- explore a detailed and large insect map<br/>  -&gt; forest environment, different plants, realistic textures, stones, mushrooms and trees<br/>- other insects: spiders, praying mantis, worms, flies, scorpions and an enemy ant colony <br/>- create complex pheromones trails<br/>- communicate with other ants and tell them to feed the queen or larvae, to follow you, to guard the nest or to help digging a new nest chamber<br/>- attack and fight enemy insects<br/>  -&gt;overwhelm insects with the power of the swarm, get support from a group of soldier ants<br/>- find food sources and collect food pieces like fruit, sugar or protein of the dead insects to feed the larvae, the queen and other ants,<br/>- explore underground caves and build a huge underground nest<br/>  -&gt;enlarge the ant hill, dig new chambers and tunnels, get support in the building process by other worker ants<br/>- play as ant queen and lay eggs<br/>- third person camera, easy touch control<br/>- 3 different camera perspectives <br/>- nest and pheromone map view<br/>- colony statistics<br/>  -&gt; change the caste ratio and the ants exploration range", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:07:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/0074ee59751b9850f36faec6b7c4383a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 399, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["mnhksdevelopment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["H.
