So one afternoon the main character (Which won't be the boyfriend but we will do think that later) Is lost in the night not knowing what to do to get home. When he sees a floating cursed smile with no body and zigzag eyes. The Smile looks at the main char (We're gonna codename him C.NAME) So smile looks at C.Name and instantly C.Name is stunned where he is. His head feels light and he cracks out a microphone randomly with no thought. Here's where GF'S replacement comes, His friend comes and says \"What are you doing!\" And C.Name says: I don't know, but someone has to deal with that floating thing. The friend can't see him. But then the smile talks and says: \"I am here, but I'm only visible to who I want to be visible to.\" Then Smile sees the mic and says: Oh! You want to sing! Well, let's see who's a true singer. <em>Thunder</em> The first song initiates <em>Cheese!</em> Is the song name... Cheese is a pretty easy song. But still difficult. After C.Name wins Smile get's mad. Smile then starts saying \"Ya know, the curse that is put on me, is worse than you think. But even if you win even more singing, I still have others, better ones But for now, I'll keep you stunned. And I won't show mercy!\" This line reveals more lore, first realizing that smile is cursed, and it's possible he is doing this against his will, or even that he is a human form. Also, he mentions he has others, possibly other smiles. Or other friends that will deal with him. Possibly even familiar friends... But then the next song initiates... Missinful LET'S JUST SAY IT GETS MORE INTENSE. And there will be a few vocals.
