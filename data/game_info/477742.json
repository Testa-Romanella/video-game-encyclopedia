Now the space suit store cannot be used until you've gained enough space gems. You gain space gems by playing the game. When you play the game, I made it with asteroids and without asteroids, so you get to pick once you choose play game. Asteroids is extremely difficult, but it has been beaten by my friends. Without asteroids is still hard to control for the beginner player, but one can learn to play. The objective of the game is to find his space ship which looks like a stereotypical alien UFO with purple particles glowing underneath it. It is a big map, so it is quite hard to find the spaceship, and it is quite easy to go out of bounds. You get warned when you leave the gem field with space gems, and you have to get back to where all the space gems are in order to continue your search for the alien space ship. To move in the game you use the space button, and you have to time the button at the right times in order to go in the right place. Do not pick up too much speed or you will go out of bounds, and lose all the space gems you've gained. Do not get hit by asteroids or ice blocks that look like ice cubes, and you will be able to keep your space gems and gain experience points or XP once you get to the space ship to get to the next level. You can spend your space gems in the store to get a new color space suit for a customizable feel to the game. You do not get to keep old space suits even if already purchased before. And space suits cost a lot because there is only one supplier in the galaxy you are in. The space suit colors are the same colors as the 7 chakra system which one would wonder why so bright colors. Colors are awesome that's why. The mission is up to you Spaceman. It is your turn to collect space gems, level up, and make it to your ship. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:12:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da4/da44a63d2588ba69231bafe5063418af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceGems47"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
