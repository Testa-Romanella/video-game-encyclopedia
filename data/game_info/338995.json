This version of the game is that which was used for our London degree show, and thus restarts automatically when left idle.<br/></p>\n<p>Divided by their musical dialects and surrounded by the sounds they\u2019ve come to\u00a0understand,\u00a0civilisations have become secluded. You\u2019ve grown up to the tunes of your hometown\u2019s string instruments, foreign to all other music. However, compelled by an unfamiliar melody echoing from the distance, you see no choice but to seek its source. With your violin in hand, you\u2019ll venture to the far tower, attain understanding through harmonisation, and learn that music knows no barriers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In\u00a0Gloria, you will explore various towns, experience a variety of musical styles and meet a charming cast of characters. Through the harmonies you build, you\u2019ll come to understand their hardships, and help them to overcome the loneliness they feel.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Developed as a Games Design &amp; Art final project, by:</p>\n<p>Ella Dawson</p>\n<p>Bernardo Viola</p>\n<p>Dean Rands</p>\n<p>George Rickard</p>\n<p>Samuel Green</p>\n<p>Tim Burnelis</p>\n<p>Sidhhant Girhotra</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T05:13:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f61/f616605475b967c8af2d678ab737ab29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Crowence"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
