She has... amnesia. What? No way. <br/>All she has with her is a torch and the warning given to her by the talking cat in front of her. She sees a car way in the distance. <br/>Maybe this is how she can escape? <br/>Faded images of ghosts linger in the distance in all directions. Luckily for her, she is a trained gymnast and her arm can move in any direction, completely disregarding how bones and the human body work.</p>\n<p>The ghosts are called Yubin Ghosts(referring to the Japanese term for <em>postal service)</em> as it seems like the have letters taped to their heads in the same fashion as a traditional Japanese style ghost. Maybe they are the souls of lost messages caught in limbo between those who have passed away and the ones who miss them most? Nope, I just thought of that then. Actually it just made a good pun so I stuck an envelope to their head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And finally, don't play this game. It's garbage.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T03:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf399bcdd42433788b784c5eabb979ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yozoraki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
