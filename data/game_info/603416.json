The number and type of planets is determined by the temperature and type of star. Some of the planet types have random texture generation using various layers of Perlin noise. If a planet is white its because i haven't done the texture generation for that type of planet yet.</p>\n<p>Some stars wont have any planets around them. Just generate a new system.</p>\n\n<p>WASD to move camera, Q and E to zoom in and out,\u00a0R to generate a new system, O and P to cycle through all planets in system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T09:04:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2dfdacf67abfa7b1329db196c9026af3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sploogal"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
