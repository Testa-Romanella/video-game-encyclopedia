Upon stepping off your car, you notice a maze out of hay and pumpkins blocking your way. This is where the fun begins, but upon finishing your first maze, you run into another obstacle, a split path. In this game as the name suggests, you will be going into a maze of mazes, all with different outcomes. Lets just hope this trip will be a safe one!<br/></p>\n<p>Story aside, This is my first time publishing a game, and its for a game jam!</p>\n<p>I had lots of fun making this and got some learning experience out of making this game alone! Since I'm new and quite honestly pretty bad at making music, I made an option that lets you mute the music.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys = Move at any direction</p>\n<p>R = Reset level in case you messed up at a level</p>\n<p>M \u00a0= Mute music if it gets too annoying</p>\n<p>Esc = Close game (While in Menu )or Head back to Menu to start all over (While Playing)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T08:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84e9cc0c12f8773fa23a95d83a01da76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MegaFuze"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
