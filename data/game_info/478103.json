This is the first time I've ever tried to make a game, which also happened to be\u00a0my submission for Brackey's Jam 2020.2: T = -T.</p>\n<p>-=== GAME DESCRIPTION ===-</p>\n<p>In T = -T, you play as a little white square. Your goal, like any platformer, is simply to reach the end. There is, however, a catch: you can travel through different states of time, states where objects were in different positions from the present. By entering these objects, you can travel in many unique ways to get from point to point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-=== CONTENTS ===-</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, game-jamming is much more difficult than I thought it would be, leading me to barely having any content (thus the \"Prototype\" release status). As of now, the game only contains a tutorial and 3 levels.\u00a0I feel like the implemented game mechanics provide for many unique and interesting levels, but I simply couldn't capitalize on it with the allotted time.</p>\n<p>-=== PERSONAL REFLECTION ===-</p>\n<p>I'm aware that there are quite a few issues with the end product: from a jittery camera to janky movement. Despite the incompleteness of the game, this was a great learning experience for me, and hope to be able to improve my programming and game making skills in the future.
