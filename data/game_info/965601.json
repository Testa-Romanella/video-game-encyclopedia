Every action you take first must go through your brain before your body can ever start moving. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nStrengthening the connection between your body and brain can make a noticeable difference in your ability to react to the world around you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere\u2019s no better way to speed up reaction times than to physically train your body to perform the response you want to happen. With React-O-Matic you\u2019re firing up the central nervous system just like you would if you were naturally responding to a stimulus. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe more you train these movements, the stronger the connection of brain and body which results in faster reaction times. <br/>\r\nFaster reaction times equal greater in-game dominance. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTake your game to the next level with React-O-Matic.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-01T02:36:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d19033227272d1eed6e3edee9accdec.jpg", "website": "https://www.zzyzx.gg/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZZYZX RD game studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ZZYZX RD game studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
