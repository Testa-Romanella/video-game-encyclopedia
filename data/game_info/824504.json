Right now what i'm doing is calculating the point of impact and pushing the player alway from it, resulting sometimes in correct but confusing results.<br/></p>\n<p>Game being made for the Novice Summer Jam.<br/></p>\n<p>Everything is being made from scratch on Unity/Aseprite during the jam!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T15:00:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88d/88dde04fcb7fad8e7e534cbf33b58a81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lilian Reese"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
