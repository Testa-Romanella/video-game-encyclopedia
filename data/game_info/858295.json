Dodge many obstacles in this endless hallway. Not sure where your classroom is, but if you keep going, you'll get there eventually...\u00a0right?</p>\n<p>Dash to Class is an endless runner game where you play as a late student trying to get to class. The objective is to survive as long as possible while dodging obstacles from textbooks, wet floors, gumballs, and other students. You'll move up and down as you dodge all these things. Every run is random so every run is a different experience with the same vibe.\u00a0The score is based on how long you've been running. Try to beat your high score or the high score of your friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made for a Game Jam assignment for a Game Programming course.</p>\n<p>Warren Pascua - Project Lead\r\n</p>\n<p>Jayden Penones - Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Alonso Aguilar - Lead Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Liam Novielli - Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Thomas Mclean - Game Designer</p>\n<p>Yue Wang - Game Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Paolo \"Face Puncher\" Mastronardi - Sound Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T10:26:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68b3d6b20517325367a1dc92bee194e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Warren"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
