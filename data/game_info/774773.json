Will it be a green hippie paradise full of gardens, a huge party, or one big factory? Will your colony be a single, enormous building or will you spread it out over hundreds of worlds? Does your transport consist of efficient teleporters or a chaotic mess of landing pads? It's all your choice!<br/>There's plenty to discover in The Final Earth 2, including hackers, hippies and even a secret society.

You built a space ship, but now your food is running out. Fortunately, you see a world just in time. It is a bit small, but certainly better than nothing. You build some farms and houses, and fulfill the basic needs of your citizens. Then, it's time to build the true city of the future!

You can also remove all ads or get the premium version with extra features as an one-time purchase!<br/><br/>- A proper city builder<br/>While this can definitively be seen as an incremental game as there are many things to discover, this is not just an idle city builder with days-long timers and microtransactions all the time.
