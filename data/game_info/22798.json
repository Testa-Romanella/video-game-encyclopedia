Murdered! And obviously Microsol, the Terraforming company wants you dead too!\nIt's that huge new rock formation you and Buce uncovered - it's Gravitium, and it's priceless. Tyrian is the only planet where it exists in commercial quantities, and Microsol are determined to control it. You can expect them to throw all their resources against you - and they won't pull any punches.\nClassic, oldschool and just awesome vertical schooter gameplay at its best.\nGameplay mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to master. \nShip Editor - create your own ship and rule the skies.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-02T14:59:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/126/12649ad4e0ab26d3b395e2923647b4cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.37, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 241, "owned": 1836, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 37, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 171, "suggestions_count": 477, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 171, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Eclipse Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Eclipse Productions"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
