You have been chosen by the Entity, a dark force that travels between the dimension of dreams. It has given you the power to manipulate dreams. The Entity seeks to increase its army of nightmares, and the great power it has given you can take you on its dark mission.<br/>Manage the balance between dream and nightmare and keep the villages safe from the Nightmares. By descending underground you will fight the Entity and its creatures with a system of fighting and puzzles, freeing captured civilians and restoring peace. <br/><br/><strong>YOUR ACTIONS SHAPE THE GAME WORLD</strong> If you keep your balance, you can explore a colorful and vibrant world. If you lose yourself, you will wander through a dark and desolate land.<br/> <br/><strong>AN AMAZING WORLD TO EXPLORE</strong> <br/>When you're not on your main mission, explore the game world: collect, trade and resell items. Meet new characters and help them in case of need. When you're tired, pitch your tent and restore your energy by crafting lots of useful items. Train and customize your horse, grow the vegetable garden or go fishing. Approach the animals that populate the world, sneaking around or hiding in the bushes. Move around on horseback, by car, boat or train... and by unlocking the right skills, being inside a dream, also through other fantastic ways.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T16:35:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/965/965be7155096481b7c7ca42225dd4a3c.jpg", "website": "https://www.therewasadream.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 464, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keydare Project"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Keydare Project"], "esrb_rating": null}
