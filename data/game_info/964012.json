You have to climb up to the sky, overcoming various platforms and objects to uncover the mystery of this puzzling world. Play alone or with friends, because it's always more fun together. Compete, co-operate and overcome all obstacles together, climbing to the top. You will find entertaining Easter eggs and references along the way. Be cautious and alert, because every item may turn out to be unpredictable, even if it behaved differently before. The absence of a save function adds to the difficulty of getting through the game. You won't get a second chance. Even the slightest wrong step can send you back to the very beginning.<br/><br/>Sometimes it can be difficult for children to realise how wide the world outside their home is.
