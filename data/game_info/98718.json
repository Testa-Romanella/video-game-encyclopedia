But fear not \u2013 if Gertrude acts quickly, she\u2019ll be able to clean the annoying poop in no time!</p>\n\n<p>The goal of Kittea Party is to find a happy balance where Gertrude has all the kittens she needs to throw a party (each new party requires more kittens than the previous), but still be able to maintain a relatively clean house. Successful (and poop-free) parties give Gertrude more prestige, which in turn means more friends!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Choose between WASD movement or WASD relative to mouse.</li><li>Press E to clean poop</li><li>Random adoption popup will appear from time to time asking if you want to adopt a cat</li><li>You need a certain number of cats to host a tea party</li><li>If a guest steps on poop, they slips and leave the house and tells everyone what happened, leaving you with less prestige.</li><li><strong>You lose</strong>\u00a0if you reach negative prestige!</li><li>When the party comes to an end you earn 1 prestige for each guest that made it</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<ul><li>There is no PAUSE menu.
