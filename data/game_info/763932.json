It\u2019s sort of a combination of a VR game with a classic first person shooter. It\u2019s another game where you fight demons with guns, but there are some things that are new. I\u2019m still trying to decide which direction to take the game. I\u2019m sending out this build to test the engine, mechanics, and to get general feedback. I have not included any story elements, and there is only one level, besides the tutorial.</p>\n<p>The tutorial is janky right now. However, if you read the text it should be sufficient to teach you how to play the game. Watching the gameplay video will give you a good idea of how the game works.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T02:37:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94f/94f2314f127ce67cd3d73266ac73ac89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 458, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Virtual Destructor"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
