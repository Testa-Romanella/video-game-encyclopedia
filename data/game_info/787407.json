{"id": 787407, "slug": "zorlok", "name": "Zorlok", "name_original": "Zorlok", "description": "<p>Zorlok\u00a0is an interactive fiction game following the bizarre misadventures of a demon with no memories and the nerdy high schooler they're bound to serve. Uncover mysteries and cause mayhem in this dark comedy about monsters, found family, personal identity, and the line between good and evil.<br/></p>\n<p>The setting and story are inspired by campy horror movies, classic murder mysteries, and an old Monster of the Week campaign. The first demo release was on May 13th, 2022. The next release is scheduled for July 1st, 2022.<br/></p>\r\nWarning:\u00a0Zorlok is rated\u00a017+ for\u00a0swearing, alcohol and drug use, sexually suggestive content, violence, self-harm, discussions about religion and mental health, and death.\u00a0\r\n\n<p>You were a terrifying demon who wielded hellfire, fought angels, and corrupted souls (or something like that). Unfortunately, that version of you vanished the night you made your deal with Tommy, a nerdy high schooler who was willing to sell you his soul if you'd help him become \"cool.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>That should have been easy. You could've sat the kid in front of a box fan for a few minutes, let him cool down, collected his soul, and been on your merry way. But, no! Before you even got a chance to introduce yourself, Tommy told you to forget your past and start going by the name <em>Zorlok</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p>So, now you're \"Zorlok\" and you have no idea who or what the Hell you really are. You know you're a demon, but that's it. You don't know why or how you became a demon, how to control your powers, you aren't even sure how these deals are supposed to work. (Like you tried the fan thing and nothing happened, so either that loophole doesn't work or there's some other trick to stealing souls you haven't quite figured out yet.)\r\n</p>\n<p>But what does it mean to be a demon? With your memories and identity stripped away, where does that leave you? You are a demon, but are you still demonic?\r\n</p>\n<p>And just in case things weren't complicated enough, you've gotten yourself involved with a group of monster hunters working for the local Fay Council. To make a long story short, you saved someone being attacked by a monster, that person was a hunter, now you're on a team with this hunter and another random human, and the three of you are supposed to protect the city of Casper from vicious predators, investigate strange deaths, and fight off evil. Whatever. You're just happy to get a break from doing Tommy's math homework.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>- Decide who you're going to be now or attempt to discover who you were\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Fully customize your gender and pronouns\r\n</li><li>Choose an alias (or use several of them)\r\n</li><li>Design your human disguise and gradually unlock your more demonic appearance\r\n</li><li>Name your loyal hellhound and select what animal they're disguised as\r\n</li><li>Watch your own alignment shift and Tommy's personality change as a result of your actions\r\n</li><li>Continue to rail against your situation or decide that maybe this isn't so bad\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>- Learn to control your infernal powers and choose the three domains at your command: <em>Fire</em> or <em>Ice</em>, <em>Sight</em> or <em>Spirit</em>, <em>Corrupting</em> or <em>Shifting</em>\n</p>\n<p>- Tell elaborate lies or risk revealing dangerous truths\r\n</p>\n<p>- Help Tommy survive high school (or sabotage him at every turn)\r\n</p>\n<p>- Explore Casper, WA, a strange little city either surrounded by or inhabited by monsters (depending on who you ask)\r\n</p>\n<p>- Set everything on fire... <em>accidentally</em>...</p>\n\r\nTommy Osorio\r\n<p>The 15 year-old who trapped you in this pact and forced you to forget your past. You'll get his soul in exchange for helping him become \"cool,\" but, after learning what \"cool\"\u00a0means in this context,\u00a0you're starting to wonder if that's an impossible task.
