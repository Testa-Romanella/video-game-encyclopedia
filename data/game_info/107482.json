Will you suffer the same fate?<br/></p>\n<p>In this open world you will find tools, items, and dungeons in whatever order you desire. Pick a direction and head out! How fast can you find everything needed to reach the end?</p>\n<p>This game saves automatically every time you enter or exit a cave, dungeon, building, etc. So there's no need to worry about losing your progress if you're forgetful!\u00a0The game still allows for manual saving if you need to stop or want to respawn mid-dungeon.<br/></p>\n<p>Secrets abound! Be sure to burn trees, blow up walls, and check under bushes!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9c96d72eb717abe5c973060140dcd2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Mighty Palm"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
