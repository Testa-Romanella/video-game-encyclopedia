Ivy and Blue has been sitting in my mind (and my folder) for far longer than I'd care to admit, so I'm beyond thrilled to share this story with you.</p>\n<p>Despite being shorter in length as well as kinetic, I&amp;B is important to me. I relate to Ivy--who--without perhaps even realizing it at first--had come to long for something meaningful in her life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The central theme(s) of I&amp;B as well are very dear to me, so I hope I was able to get them across clearly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone on the team did such a wonderful job--the game turned out far better than what I\u00a0had first envisioned years ago, and certainly better than what I\u00a0could have created on my own.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for checking out Ivy and Blue, we all appreciate it!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T16:16:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea8/ea8d754e9fd73a23e2e1f71b8c0b5051.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Neeka of OBP"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
