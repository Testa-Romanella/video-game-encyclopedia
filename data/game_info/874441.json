The incident is reported as a freak accident.<br/><br/>Unknown to Earth's inhabitants, in reality the implosion is caused by a wormhole, which teleports the convoy to another galaxy, millions of light years away from their home planet. While some transport vessels are destroyed during the event, some emerge from the wormhole relatively unharmed and somewhat separated from each other.<br/><br/>Equipped with only the knowledge, crew and resources on-board, the captains now face a new struggle: Survival in an unknown star system and finding a means to return to Earth.<h3>FEATURES</h3><br/><strong>Take command</strong> of the Merida Space Mining Company transport vessel TV-201 and prepare to defend her against regular attack.<br/><br/><strong>Traverse planet surfaces with landing vehicles</strong>, evading threats and obstacles along the way, in search of your crew, or to gather resources.<br/><br/><strong>Find and rescue your crew</strong> scattered over the galaxy.
