{"id": 794372, "slug": "malkuth", "name": "Malkuth", "name_original": "Malkuth", "description": "<p>Malkuth is an art game where players are spawned into a far future world and have a brief five minutes to decode and comprehend the mystery that the world represents. The mechanism is simple. Large towers are inscribed with a divine message that the player must read and interpret. Furthermore, mechanical angels eventually descend from the sky and increase the difficulty of reading the text; however, they are a phenomena that crucially helps the player understand the meaning of the text. When the angels spawn, the player will be chased, and the scene will shift from day to night. The player will engage in a kind of \"chase-dance\" with the angels. At the five minute mark, the experience will end, and the player will be overwhelmed by them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T10:27:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ceb/ceb3c946ab48addc58dbbf9e4aa5fa7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["saitogroup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
