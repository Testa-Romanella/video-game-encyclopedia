Each soldier has different stats which is good to take in consideration when deciding what squad to send to a mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can cycle through all of your squads using the up and down arrows.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nSending a squad on a mission is done with the top most buttons (A, B, and C are the different locations).\u00a0On the right is an indicator that displays if a squad is ready for a new mission\u00a0or already on a mission.\u00a0\r\n\n\r\nMap Terminal UI\r\nWhen accessing the map terminal, you can cycle through the different maps using the buttons on the bottom left.\u00a0The letter tells you what map you are currently looking at.\r\n\n\r\nTips\r\nYou can send out multiple squads to different missions\u00a0at the same time. You can also send out multiple squads to the same location.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nControls\r\nMove with W, A, S, and D\r\nWalk up to a terminal to access it and walk away when you are done.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMade by BatoRoy.\r\n\r\nAll music and audio comes from ProductionCrate:\u00a0https://www.productioncrate.com\r\n\r\nBrowser version of\u00a0Strategy Out of Control that didn't compile in time to be published before the deadline:\u00a0https://batoroy.itch.io/strategy-out-of-control-web", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6b/b6b5339aa51867e12028adcb39243b4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BatoRoy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
