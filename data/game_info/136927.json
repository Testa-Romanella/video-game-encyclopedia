The game can get a bit complicated...<br/></p>\n<p>=======================================</p>\n<p>Have you ever played a 15-puzzle or sliding puzzle before? You know the one, where there's one free space, and you need to move the tiles to complete a picture? Combine that with the elements of a dungeon crawl, and you have Dungeon Slide! Try your hand with this puzzle / RPG, and see how much treasure you can escape with!</p>\n<p>=======================================</p>\n<p>Dungeon Slider is mobile-friendly! If you have a phone with a browser and a touchscreen, you can play directly!<br/></p>\n<p>This has been a rather fun game to make, even though I didn't make it in time for the LD41 compo. There's still plenty of room for improvement; consider this build a prototype, or proof of concept.<br/></p>\n<p>=======================================</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<ol><li>You can move any tile that's adjacent to an empty space by tapping / clicking on it!<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Not only can you move your hero, but enemies, treasure, and even blank tiles too!</li><li>Your goal is to get the hero to the exit, while collecting as much treasure as possible!<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - The exit is ALWAYS at the bottom-right of the map.</li><li>Click on the Magnifying Glass button to view the floor layout!<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - <strong>Warning!</strong> This action costs mana to perform, and you only start with 3! Use it wisely!</li><li>Blessed ground (the floor tile with a cross) will protect heroes and treasure that is standing atop of it!</li><li>When you reach the exit, any treasure that's on top of blessed ground will be collected!<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Treasure that is NOT on blessed ground will not be obtained!</li><li>When a player or an enemy moves, they will 'attack' in the direction they're moving!<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Attacking consumes Power, so be mindful of how many attacks you have left!</li><li>Monsters can 'attack' treasure and destroy them! Be careful!</li><li>Use the ? button to view stats of units and floor tiles. This is helpful to discern the special abilities of each enemy!</li><li>Some levels require you to place a key over a keyhole to unlock the exit!</li><li>At the start of every floor, your HP, Power and Mana are refilled!</li></ol>\n<p>======================================</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>\n<p>- GraphicsGale - Pixel art<br/>- GameMaker Studio - Game engine</p>\n<p>======================================</p>\n<p>Update 1.1</p>\n<ul><li>Added new enemies!<ul><li>Spike<ul><li>Cannot be attacked when its spikes are out</li><li>A threat that prevents players from moving in certain directions</li></ul></li><li>Burrowbug<ul><li>Digs underground when on a blank floor tile, and burrows out when an empty space moves over it!</li><li>Forces the player to have better memory, or check the floor more often</li></ul></li><li>Negaknight<ul><li>Transfers any damage it receives to the player!
