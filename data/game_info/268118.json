As you progress, the levels get a little trickier. From the first level, you start out with 5 lives and the time you're at the last level you only have 3 lives to spare. Similar to Demon Souls, there are no save points or re-spawn locations. Once you die, you start all over. Use your special double jump power to traverse and learn as you continue on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Movement Configuration: W, A, S, D.</p>\n<p>-Double Jump: Double click left mouse button.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Borrowed art from BayatGames (Unity Asset Store)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78d983c0a7c862205476bb4469470423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChrisCast13"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
