It was made with the help of two of my classmates, Eirwyn Zheng and Christian Kessler. It sees the player using a microscopic ship to enter the body of a sick patient zero and eliminating the virus before it can spread and kill the host. It's a short arcade style shooter that we hope you enjoy. I'm very excited to see all of your feedback and to see what you think of the experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T13:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93b8cbee0021eba02b20c5d28c036292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brickson95"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
