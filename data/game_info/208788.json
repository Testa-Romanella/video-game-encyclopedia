A little Eroxxie had recently got his hands on the engine Game Maker and wanted to make a zombie game. It would late become BrainZ.<br/>BrainZ is my first ever published game on the internet and since it was my first published project in Game Maker, the result was a bit faulty.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Now</strong>, 5 years later, its remake gets many of its idea i had back in the days thanks to me getting better in Game Maker development and game design.</p>\n<p>BrainZ: The Remake uses the same gameplay as its original game with you trying to survive a horde of zombies. Survive as long as possible until they kill you (the original game didnt have a healthbar. Be thankful that i gave you one in this game)!<br/>I might update the game further with new content and improvements, but i wanted to stay as close as possible to the original game!<br/>The game uses the Game Jolt API, but it can be played without login in, unless you want to log in to earn some nice trophies (on Game Jolt)!</p>\n<p>If you still want to try my first game, which was never made into a executable file unfortunately, you can find it here at Game Maker Steam\u00a0workshop:\u00a0http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=199790405</p>\n<p><em>Controls</em></p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Movement</li><li>Space: Fire gun</li><li>R: Reload</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71e/71ed49e37045d6de85038f42d810ad71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eroxxie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
