The biological entity codenamed 'MG101 - The Malignant Gore' consumed everything in its path. By the time the alarm system activated, only one survivor remained- a lone scientist blinded by panic.\u00a0<br/>If he can get to the mainframe computer and input the self-destruct sequence, perhaps we can destroy MG101 forever.\u00a0<br/>It is a suicide mission, but left untended the Malignant Gore will continue to spread until it has consumed all life on Earth. This is our only chance.</p>\n<p>Your job is to man the gun turrets and guide our survivor through the contaminated rooms of the Omicron Shadow Facility. Each turret only holds 6 bullets, so use them wisely. If you make a mistake you can use a temporal sphere to reset time and try again. These spheres are very rare, so use them sparingly.
