You over there! It isn\u2019t too late to turn back. To just flutter away unscathed, like a dainty butterfly narrowly evading a cobweb. More like a... <strong>macabre</strong> web! Get it? <br/><br/>But we\u2019re already past that, aren\u2019t we? <br/><br/>You \u2014 a lowly gnomeling \u2014 are just too curious for your own good. <br/><br/>YOU want to know how it feels to race... through MY mind. To blast off... your rocker. To fly like a fairy... with no strings attached. You really think you can comb through MY catacombs and come out on top, don\u2019t you? How cute. Or are you one of those kamikazes? Let\u2019s just say you\u2019ll be a coma-kaze after I\u2019m done with you!<br/><br/>Because we only sell one-way tickets to the state of Catatonia. No, in the Nation of Imagi, there are no flyover states. You will stop. You will stay a while. Maybe even forever. But don\u2019t you worry your pretty little head! It won\u2019t be intac\u2014 errr, it\u2019s going to have so much fun, it\u2019ll be insane! Hysterical, really. <br/><br/>Feeling disoriented yet? Just wait \u2018til you\u2019re whizzing through the Nooks of Crania. Soaring through the Serotunnel. Racing your own intrusive thoughts. Zooming over highways, byways, and freeways. But wait a sec. Are you really on a freeway if you\u2019re captiv\u2026 ated? Ha, ha, ha! <br/><br/>Anyway, if you\u2019re brazen enough to make it this far, you\u2019re a lost cause. Go on, dauntlessly don those wings. The first set\u2019s on me! Customize your look if you want, but what\u2019s the point? There\u2019s no room for vanity in insanity! And everyone knows all gnomelings look alike when they\u2019re turned inside out. Figuratively, of course. Well, maybe... dis-figuratively. Because when you don\u2019t mind your own business, I might get busy bending your mind. And it may not ever bend back. <br/><br/>Soon, you\u2019ll know exactly... what... I... mean.<br/> <br/>Enjoy the curs\u2014 errr, course!<br/><br/>Forever yours, <br/>Malchrim Ick", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T06:06:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eca/eca0684d985ec2284c28749a584b9e49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Octopus Cuddles"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Octopus Cuddles"], "esrb_rating": null}
