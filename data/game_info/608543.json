Make a game using DragonRuby that is inspired by the game Gauntlet.\u00a0 Shouldn't be impossible. <br/></p>\n<p>Now, I haven't made many games, nor have I written a single line of Ruby ever before this, but I like the DragonRuby project and the simplicity of it compared to anything else I have played with, so I decided to try it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will hopefully post something here that is possible to try. If the game is up here and it's not working, that is kind of to be expected. It has a server component that might be running, but it also might have crashed or something else :)\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T09:01:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d5a785a3fc7ed853f6317532fe57050.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["nerdur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
