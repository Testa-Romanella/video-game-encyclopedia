Throw, catch and intercept the frisbee - just catch within the opponents endzone to score!</p>\n<p>I developed this project in Processing, a java-based language, for a University assignment. Despite being top-down view, I implemented 3D projectile physics which models properties as the mass,\u00a0 cross-sectional area and drag co-efficient of the frisbee to produce accurate flying behaviour. I also developed an AI for both the opponent and the player's own team, who position themselves artificially, aswell as throw, intercept and score. I was able to implement a variable difficulty, which affected the opponents throwing accuracy and range,\u00a0 their positioning and speed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Specifically, I attempted to emulate a teams' actual positioning throughout a game with an automatic movement system throughout the pitch. This took the distance from opponents and teammates, distance from the frisbee and whether the team was attacking or defending into account when positioning.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T06:26:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/9575dc61af15c5d7c66f17ae0f3fd4d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Hutchinson"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
