The board has no \"edges\" and going too far in one direction loops you to the other side like a PacMan level. The goal is to make a cycle that loops you though your color's edge and back to where you started before your opponent can. Despite it's simple rules, there's a world of strategy in CycloHex and countless ways to out-think your opponent!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay against your friends locally or online, or take on the built-in AI!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T03:30:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/3144b5c3947d6b7adada88e41ea165e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Alex Obatake"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alex Obatake"], "esrb_rating": null}
