The reason is that he killed a good friend of myself and left a letter to you. In addition, he seems not very good at talking, looks very strong, but he came. Very weak at the time. When do you have time, I will send you the letter.\"<br/>Liu Qingchun: \"... No need, I will pick it up by myself.\"<br/><br/>A letter:<br/>Team Liu, I found a way to calm myself down, so I wrote this letter and decided to surrender. I have been living in a dirty sewer during this period of time. I think maybe everyone will forget me, but I can't forget Jasmine.<br/><br/>I went to see their mother and daughter that night, and because of that they were lucky enough to not die. I took them to a safe place, but Ying Xueer (Jasmine) said that she didn\u2019t want to stay in Beijing anymore, and their mother and daughter went to Ningxia , I have the address, and I will leave it to you.<br/><br/>The reason why I went to Nanhe to surrender was because the sewer where I lived was actually near the branch office; second, I knew he had a deadly opponent named Hong Qianzu, who I met in the dance hall, was a mysterious and vicious person. It was him who replaced Sun Meiqi to kill Jasmine, and he and Zhao Huiying knew each other. I think these are useful for protecting their mother and daughter. In addition, please be sure to find them, protect them, and I will provide everything I know.<br/>I am very weak now, maybe my method can only make me sober for a short while, if I don't get through, I still have some clues left where I live.<br/><br/>The second episode of the sixth season (S06E02)<br/><br/><br/>Nan He: Have the procedures been completed?<br/>Intern: It's a bit troublesome, but everything is done. Here are some related materials. Are you sure to go?<br/>Nanhe: I have to go. I have a letter here that you ask the director for a leave by the way, so I won't go by myself.<br/>Intern: OK, but...<br/>Nan He: It's okay, go, and see the director, maybe I will give you a bonus for turning into a regular position.
