You stand on platforms that shatter if you stand there for too long and you need to get to the next platform or checkpoint before it shatters.<br/><br/>This is my first ever game jam, we entered this game jam a day late and the crunch was real. I am really happy with the way this turned out though, the QUBE inspired aesthetics, the level design inspired by the bunnyhopping linear obstacle course levels from Counter-Strike and the fact that it's only 84mb is something I never thought we would achieve.<br/><br/>The game did go through some drastic changes in the prototyping phase and the \"on thin ice\" theme ended up not being so literal in the end but I think the game still gives you a feeling of being on thin ice all the time. It's just not winter themed.</p>\n\n<p>Made by:</p>\n<p>\u00d6rvar \"Wheeze\" Arn\u00f3rsson (Coding, level design, environment design)<br/>Alavanh \"Ace0fspad3s\" Chanthasaly (3d art, environment design, level design)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2cdb0179803a28f1ac36a37c6651ebf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wheeze"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
