The assignment was to recreate an old arcade game and to add your own mechanics inside to make it unique. Then we had to present it. So I decided to remake PacMan, and I added a shield mechanic to protect the player, as well as a teleporting mechanic. I also made a new ghost that moves randomly across the screen. This is the first game I have made by myself, so I decided to put this on Itch to showcase my progress that I have made over the last few months. If you download, I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Music by:\u00a0 bensound.com<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T03:19:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce1/ce1f589d5b02a3b7d67e501e3f97285c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zaidis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
