Progress through the levels by destroying the oncoming missiles and correctly defining set words to complete the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Important! Instructions for use:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You can set the words + definitions you want to study through the 'options' (the spanner icon in the menu screen).</li><li>You will need a password to access these options. The password is 'TeacherAccess'.</li><li>Set the words and their corresponding definitions in the spaces provided. Please make sure to always add the words with a capital letter at the start, as the program does not recognise answers unless they are typed identically to the preset answer.</li><li>If you encounter any problems or have any questions, feel free to comment on the itch.io page or email me at <strong>haywireindiegamestudios@gmail.com</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Also, while this game is free,\u00a0it would still be awesome if you could leave me a donation (even as little as $1). Donating helps me to create future programs and is a great overall morale boost for me!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/0006e853e732a97f8b92c04b9b1c4aae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CamCog"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
