I made it using Godot game engine</p>\n<p>The game is called fries. I got the idea for this game while I was thinking of my friend's upcoming birthday. She likes fries. So I decided to make her a game with fries.</p>\n<p>You take control of the fries and you dodge all the things in life as best as you can, responsibilities, annoying people,writers blocks, college assignments. But no matter how good you are, they will always get you in the end. But that doesn't matter, because you can always good times come back and you also get better at doing this as time passes,and you learn to enjoy it. That's what this game is about.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you guys like my idea, any input is welcome.</p>\n\n<p>This game is free and small so do give it a try</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T04:40:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faaaaa8c0c6d7f6d4c76084e457abf1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stfuandkissmyturtle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
