You need to navigate the levels using the recoil from the various guns you're equipped with. While doing that, you need to either avoid or compenstate for the enemies shooting at you. While you can't die from the bullets, they have a knockback effect. Pretty much all the walls are decorated with spikes which are the only way to get killed in the game, so watch out to not get impaled!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/><em>LMB - shoot<br/>Scroll wheel - switch weapons<br/>ESC - pause<br/>alt +f4 - exit\u00a0:P</em><br/><br/>Made for GMTK Jam in 48 hours.</p>\n\n<p>PS Doesn't this page look awesome?
