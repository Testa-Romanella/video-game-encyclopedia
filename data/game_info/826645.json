Your mission is to navigate to the given waypoints, defeat any encountered resistance, and then defend the location until new coordinates are given. Remember to pay attention to your heat, and check your radar frequently to track waypoints/enemies. Points are picked at random, and waves get harder as time goes on - survive as long as you can. <br/></p>\n<p>***A\u00a0NOTE ABOUT THE DIFFERENT BUILDS***</p>\n<p>The original jam version of Sentinel contained a graphics error that was specific to that build, was not present at any point in development, and was not presenting in the editor. I found a workaround for the bug\u00a0shortly after the initial upload, and included the fixed build (Sentinel_FOG_FIX<strong>)\u00a0</strong>as well as the original jam upload\u00a0since it was a more authentic version of the project. For the best experience, it is recommended that you play the fix version.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS--------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>it is highly recommended to follow the initial tutorial prompts when starting the game, but in case they do not display properly:</p>\n<p>MOVEMENT</p>\n<p>-W/D throttle</p>\n<p>-SPACE brake</p>\n<p>- A/D turn body</p>\n<p>-Q/E rotate turret</p>\n\n<p>WEAPONS</p>\n<p>- 1,2,3 quick select single weapon</p>\n<p>-SHIFT + 1,2,3 toggle weapons, and combine. More weapons selected at once means slower movement, and more heat build. Remember to off weapons when not needed to move quicker. <br/></p>\n<p>- LMB fire</p>\n\n<p>FUNCTIONS</p>\n<p>- F use cooling charge. Overheating can stall your mech, use cooling charges when you start seeing heat warnings. <br/></p>\n<p>- H open/close hatch</p>\n<p>- ENTER turn on/off mech. Turning your mech off will allow it to heal for a certain amount. <br/>- RMB quick look at cockpit</p>\n\n<p>All graphics, programming, and game design were done by Carlo Sbisa</p>\n<p>https://linktr.ee/Justasquid0<br/></p>\n<p>Radio sound effects provided by Vinny Bouchard</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/mirror-world<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T14:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/871/87166d701c3713bc760b48db7a393bd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theEarthWasBlue"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
