Upon arriving on its surface, the NEVEC forces are met with resistance from an alien race called the Acrid and is forced to leave the planet. A second attempt to colonize E.D.N. is taken by NEVEC which has been preparing for the assault. It is revealed that the Acrid contain thermal energy within them.
