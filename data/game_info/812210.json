{"id": 812210, "slug": "pact-2", "name": "Pact", "name_original": "Pact", "description": "Your body broken and soul shattered, locked away in far away lands to ensure you never return. That's what the Empire had hoped, at least. Foolish mortals, dragons aren't so easily stamped out. Awakened after years of drifting aimlessly in your ethereal prison, you find a new opportunity when the indentured Kobolds unearth the last unrecovered shard of your consciousness. Under a strong claw, help them throw off their shackles, unite the forces of evil, take vengeance upon the rulers of good, and return you to your body to be unleashed upon the world.<h3>THE CHOICE IS YOURS</h3>With RTS gameplay and production chains inspired by classics, you'll find much familiar in the gameplay of Pact - but instead of choosing a single faction at the start, imagine building your unique playstyle on-the-fly and competitively through meaningful, either-or situations. There is always more available to you than you can take advantage of, so its up to you to decide what to prioritize.<h3>A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS</h3>Kobolds are very enthusiastic minions, but unfortunately just as inept. While they form the backbone of your industry, you'll need to enlist the aid of the other races oppressed by the Empire. Orcs, demons, spiders, undead, and more are itching for a chance to be freed from their yokes. But take care - the forces of evil are an uncooperative bunch at the best of times, a lot rife with rivalries. Choose carefully which alliances to forge, but don't be surprised if you meet those you spurned on the battlefield. Each faction comes with their own specialties and weaknesses. Units, structures, upgrades, and spells offered will all contribute to how you go about conquering the land.<h3>THE EMPIRE</h3>While you toil away in secrecy at first, the forces of good will not sit idle. As you venture out to find and exploit areas rich in resources, they will do the same. Raid and steal from the outskirts of their outposts to feed your silent growth, or launch full-scale assaults to remove them from the area, and its bounties, completely.<h3>A DYNAMIC MAP</h3>Camps, outposts, and villages of the Empire are just some of the locations in flux in the world of Pact. Take on a variety of context-sensitive quests from the factions of evil, track down large monsters for even larger rewards, or chase the rarest materials across the map as the winds of magic ebb and flow.<h3>Disclaimer</h3>Liberation Games is in no way affiliated with Age of Empires, Starcraft, Stronghold, The Settlers, or Anno.
