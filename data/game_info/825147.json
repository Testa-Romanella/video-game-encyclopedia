Next you will need to get every Element and you will create High Particles (first prestige currency) you can Ascend to get High Particles faster or reset Brewing but its not recommended at start. Unlock more potions in Ascend \u00a0and Refining, second reset layer (Metal) doesn't reset Brewing but it resets High Particles, and doesn't reset Ascend upgrades and unlocks, for Metal you can buy metals in Metal tab, they grants carious boosts (few useless, so don't worry to use them) and you can Refine for metals, use carefully no-useless metals. Metal reset don't give you writen amount of Metal but turn you current to written value.</p>\n<p>good luck</p>\n<p>Kijomsz<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T19:52:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a658d34da91af5eab1deb0cfb45c03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kijomsz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
