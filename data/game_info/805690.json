{"id": 805690, "slug": "micro-charge", "name": "Micro-Charge", "name_original": "Micro-Charge", "description": "<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a puzzle-platformer about finding batteries and placing them into designated power stations. Power stations activate specific platforms tied to them, depending on whether a battery is inserted into one.\u00a0Every platform has a \"ping pong\" pattern, where they will constantly move back and forth on designated paths.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As soon as you insert a battery into a power station, the specific platforms will start moving. When a\u00a0battery is taken out, the platforms will stop moving. Use this to your advantage! <em>(though not required for completion,\u00a0in some cases, you can position the platforms in such a way that you can jump across them without having to have them activated, so use this to your advantage!)</em><strong><br/><br/>Since you're smaller than a battery, you can only carry one at a time. You must make a decision to choose which station you want to activate and which you must leave behind.\u00a0To complete the game, you need to remove batteries from previous power stations and insert them into the proper stations to properly reach the cloud sanctuary!<br/><br/>STORY:</strong><br/>After arriving home from school, your parents tell you that you and your twin's room just got renovated with the two best themes on earth: space and pirates! How awesome is that? You run up to your newly renovated room excited to see it for the first time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0As you enter the room you're filled with excitement and curiosity at the sight of you and your brother's favorite themes, until the door actually opens. \"What is this??\" you ask, as you enter the room. \"I thought this room would be bigger!\" Before you could even begin to throw a tantrum, you look up to the sky window towards the blinding sun rays and you're hit with a beam of light shrinking you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\"Ahhhh!\" you scream, as you fall toward the ground. You hardly recognize your room with how small you've become. Suddenly, a mysterious voice from the sky comes from above: \"I am the space-pirate spirit. You wanted your room to be bigger, so I fulfilled your request! Do not act ungrateful! Most children your age could only dream of a room of this size. Now, I will return to my slumber in the cloud sanctuary. Please do not disturb me. Don't even think about using the batteries scattered across the room to activate the various floating objects to reach me! Only a fool would do that!\" The voice disappears. You decide to pursue the space-pirate spirit in the cloud sanctuary to demand that he returns you to your previous size. Noticing the many batteries lying around the room, you decide to make use of the resources you have to activate the platforms to reach the cloud sanctuary.<br/><br/><strong>CREDITS:\u00a0</strong><br/>Musical Composer, Sounds ~ Filip Bagewitz<br/>Programming,\u00a0 Game\u00a0Concept\u00a0~ Matthew Dadoun</p>\n<p>3D Art, Game\u00a0Design\u00a0\u00a0~ Michael Mcphillips</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T17:22:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a3f41d371745321eca75b0f6c41f7ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["matthewdadoun"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
