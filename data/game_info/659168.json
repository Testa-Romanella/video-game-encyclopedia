Escape goes to main menu.</p>\n<p>After three (3) rounds, a LIMIT BREAK occurs and your group of facilitators will need to pick what kind of help our monster most needs.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you'll help our monster flourish today! If not, that's ok too. Either way, our monster knows you'll all be there when they're ready to seek help again, and you can keep trying with other community monsters in other situations. </p>\n<p>Strive for better, not perfection.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
