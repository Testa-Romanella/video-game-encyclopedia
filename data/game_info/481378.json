A ROBpOcket is a digital key that connects to a fightcomputer, it contains your rank and pocket robot(fighter).</p>\n<p>This is a very early alpha for the game, only contains one fighter and the fighting mode. And it has bugs (probably a lot).<br/></p>\n<p>inputs:</p>\n\n\n<p>The keyboard emulates a controller</p>\n<p>Z/W=&gt; up dpad<br/>Q/A=&gt; left dpad<br/>S=&gt; down dpad<br/>D=&gt; right dpad<br/>J=&gt; A button<br/>K=&gt; B button<br/>L=&gt; Tag button<br/>I=&gt; X button<br/>O=&gt; Y button<br/>P=&gt;\u00a0 Assist button<br/></p>\n\n<p>Some notes:</p>\n<p>There are not throws and low hit/guard, you can use a guardbreak to open up enemy, a running hit count's as guardbreak.\r\n<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Guardbreak can be canceled with guard<br/>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0After guardbreak first hit during recovery will launch.</p>\n<p>You can burn half bar of energy for dodging.
