It's (literally) non-stop fun as you tap the screen to dodge side-to-side. <br/><br/>You're zooming down an infinite tube, sliding past crazy obstacles and trying to collect popsicles (points), juice boxes (shields) and hearts (health). Default mode has 4 levels, all with a satisfying end point. But in true endless mode, the slide never stops! By playing the 4 levels for long enough in endless mode, you can unlock 2 bonus levels that open up even more ceaseless fun. <br/><br/>Slide on!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T03:36:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3eea2b0b0d11511c25d5788ddc99e180_ZtoX8C1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sinking Ship Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Sinking Ship Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
