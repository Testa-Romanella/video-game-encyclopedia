This only goes over the first chapter of the game and doesn't really go into the full story of the \"Seattle Six\" at this time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. No Images or music has been put into this at the moment.</p>\n<p>3. Didn't get to add in any type of battle with the Seattle Six, but I\u00a0plan on working further with this project on my own time.</p>\n\n<p>As always thank you for playing, please leave a comment about anything you liked or disliked about the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T04:55:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40c/40c857a4a46d88d4b2b16176b7e4435a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["neverdarkentertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
