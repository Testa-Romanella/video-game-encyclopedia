Incoming enemies fight back and your units can die. You can cast spells to support your army while fighting an invasion. Expect to see spectacular brawls, sensational magic, and epic battles.</p>\n<p>This is a re-release of the mobile version of the game. It's the same build but I've increased the reward structure per level such that the upgrades can be acquired easily.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T07:07:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/054/054649101a1c489869b2bd881dd99183.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coffeebrain", "robotwithasmile"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
