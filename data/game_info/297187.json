I ensure you, reader, that nothing of any interest or entertainment happens here, so you should probably just turn away. Now, if you're like me, you're probably thinking \"Ah, reverse psychology. Probably to make up for the lack of actual quality in the game.\" Well, I'll tell you a little bit more about it then.</p>\n<p>There are no random encounters, all enemies are visible on the map. Most battles are designed to be quick, 2-5 turns (except bosses and minibosses.)\u00a0There is focus on gameplay, story, and comedy. Chapter 1 is about 45 minutes long, 30 if you skip some of the extra stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh! Important tip: check the inventory tab to see your quests in the far right tab.</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 2 is currently halfway finished! Check it out when I release it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:32:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78d922f5edf260140a73e9fc8089cef4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlyingSockCat"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
