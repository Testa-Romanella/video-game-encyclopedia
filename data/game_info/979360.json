How absurd!!! Sacrilege!!! The game gets more difficult as you pass the level. The ships can appear from six different rows, and there are six keys for you to paint them, before they reach the bottom of the screen (Q, W, E, I, O, P - and their respective on the Controller). I hope you have a lot of fun playing! :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T06:10:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/438/438de7ce2e104b9fc01fb97933fd90ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Marcos Raoi"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Marcos Raoi"], "esrb_rating": null}
