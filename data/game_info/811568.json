Each simulated body consists of a network of particles that can be enriched with higher-level functions, ranging from pure information processing capabilities to physical equipment (such as sensors, muscles, weapons, constructors, etc.) whose executions are orchestrated by a signaling system. The bodies can be thought of as agents or digital organisms operating in a common environment.</p>\n<p>The simulation code is written entirely in CUDA and optimized for large-scale real-time simulations with millions of particles. The development is driven by the desire to better understand the conditions for (pre-)biotic evolution and the growing complexity of biological systems. An important goal is to make the simulator user-friendly through a modern user interface, visually appealing rendering and a playful approach.\r\n</p>\n<p>The simulator is open-source and also available at https://github.com/chrxh/alien.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T12:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66a/66a199914642481b4353fb17e55fddfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chrxh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
