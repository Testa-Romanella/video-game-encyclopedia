Our little bot will take care of your new computer, and you will never ever again have to worry about evil software  damaging it. But Cubot is not the one who is going to delete the evil foes, the complement Cir will. Just install our tiny software and Cubot will do the rest. Although, if you want to help, you can control them manually! You only have to run it and press the button to start it up. It is easy as that. And how am I supposed to control it, you may be wondering. Here you go:<br/>\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>W,A,S,D.\u00a0</strong>Moves Cubot.</li><li><strong>Arrow keys.</strong> Cir will attack in that direction.</li><li><strong>Space.\u00a0</strong>Cubot dashes toward the direction in which they are moving. </li><li><strong>ESC or P.</strong> Stops the manual mode.</li></ul>\n<p>Please note that Cubot in manual mode has an energy limit, if they are hit too many times they will need to rest!<br/></p>\n<p>That being said, if you found a bug or if you have a suggestion, please send a\u2026<br/></p>\n\n<p>The note ends there, as part of it is torn out. This seems an abandoned project that never came out, but as you hold it in your hands, you start wondering if you want to share it with the world, maybe someone will have some fun with the manual mode.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T11:39:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/932/932ddb6cde31e7c9419bd758239be2c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Luna Alaminos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
