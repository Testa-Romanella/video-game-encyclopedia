It utilizes a combination of <strong>high-framerate stereoscopic 180\u00b0-video</strong> and interactive elements for breathing, mindful listening, playfulness, humming, and frequency entrainment.<br/><br/>You can choose from several (currently six) experiences, each offering a different scenery, general atmosphere and meditative narration. <br/>In the <strong>Session Timing</strong> options you can set the start time and duration for the different guide features: <strong>Voice-over, Breathing Guide, Spatial Sounds, Humming Guide, Frequency Entrainment, and Element of Play</strong>.<br/>Each feature has various settings that you can adjust according to your preferences. For example, the breathing tempo, which affects a customizable visual focus object, can be a fixed user-defined tempo or controlled using your hand or belly movement. <br/><br/>The focus of this application is less on giving a step-by-step voice guidance, but on creating small cinematic journeys with a poetic and meditative touch. <br/><br/>Realms of Flow strives to offer unique immersive audio-visual atmospheres to provide thoughtful inspiration, evoke emotions, and create interesting, soothing, and meaningful states of mind that will hopefully enrich your palette of being. - <strong>Immerse yourself in the infinite Realms of Flow!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-03T03:07:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b3/8b381baa9bd6a42b1dc81b3022041ce7.jpg", "website": "https://epicscapes.de/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marc Zimmermann"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["EpicScapes"], "esrb_rating": null}
