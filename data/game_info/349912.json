I was shocked to know that people would grow up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMy cousin didn't know about death until he was 8 years old, because I told him that he was terrified.<br/>\r\nWill you die?<br/>\r\nYes, everyone will die, you don't know? I think it's very interesting. He doesn't even know that?<br/>\r\nAnd he asked, What about me?<br/>\r\nIt will be.<br/>\r\nWhat about my mother?<br/>\r\nYes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this way, he knew a cruel truth.<br/>\r\nWhen I saw his face was not good, I comforted him that it would be a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLooking back on his understanding of death, it seems not so simple. Did he understand it in a flash? <br/>\r\nIf so, what did he do in eight years? Now suddenly it's clear?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeath should be a very abstract concept. Understanding is not simple. <br/>\r\nIt takes a lot of time for human beings to understand it from the beginning of childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHuman beings should know death in the series of explorations of games, toys, cartoons, animals and so on from childhood.<br/>\r\nIn the process of growing up slowly, I learned the ability of substitution promotion, and finally asked:<br/>\r\nWill you die? Will I die? Will people die?<br/>\r\nAfter getting the answer, we put human beings into the concept of death and understand human death.<br/>\r\nIt's like when I was a kid I didn't know that human beings would grow up, <br/>\r\nbut I knew that some things would grow up. I understood the concept of growing up.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow can we not die? In reality, there is indeed a shortcut to immortality at the cost of: Do you believe in reincarnation?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, does reincarnation exist?<br/>\r\nIn the game,<br/>\r\nYou use the \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\" selection button to judge the content of the statement, like the flowchart, step by step get the answer to prove it existence.<br/>\r\nYou will find that it is not an unanswerable question.<br/>\r\nOn the contrary, proof is very simple, just simple logical reasoning.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/355/355994a8f8d9ec35eb5cd6800ff10f1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JW"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Jw"], "esrb_rating": null}
