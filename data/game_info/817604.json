I really enjoy watching the podcast on youtube, and with the amount of content stretching across the trash taste channel and the boys own channels I think there's a lot of potential for something fun with loads of jokes and easter eggs for fans. Gameplay wise, I want to aim for a style similar to like Stick Fight: the game and Nidhogg, where both players have the exact same move set so it's balanced. And an item drop for variation. Nothings really set in stone though. That way i was thinking you could play as whoever you want without being at a disadvantage.\r\n</p>\n<p>With the debates and the banter they have, creates some cool and funny unique dialog for characters. The drip, man, so much potential for great skins. And the guests and people who have collaborated with the boys as different characters.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nThe prototype and ideas:\r\n\r\n<p>I made a prototype to give a better idea of i mean, there\u2019s not really too much content in there but i think it shows the gist.\r\nYou can play as one of the boys, against another at random in a one v one in the trash taste set and that's pretty much it. And there's basically one attack move, a punch. I want to keep it simple, but it is pretty lackluster at the moment. I want to add a projectile attack and maybe an attack out of the charge like in ninja storm, that could be a grab or something.\r\nFor Gamemodes, quick play, just a single normal one v one.<br/>A ladder type arcade mode. With a \u201cbig bad\u201d at the end, and unique win screens. Beating this would unlock characters and some skins.<br/>Two player vs.</p>\r\nWhere i need some help:\r\n<p>I want to stuff this with as many references as possible, so I'd like some help with some ideas for the game. For example I want to add the projectile move, it acts the same for all characters, but the sprite would be unique for all characters and that would be some kind of reference. I was having some trouble there. The dialog and the reasons they\u2019re fighting could be way better, looking like mk9 story mode for some of the interactions. Win phrases included.\r\nI just copied the first paragraph off youtube.fandom.com for the character descriptions with slight changes to fit the text box. Those could be better and more personal maybe. \r\nI'll be working on things like these as well, but only get the chance to work on things in my time off work so progress might be a bit slow..\r\n</p>\n<p>But if you have any ideas or feedback it would be greatly appreciated.<br/>Thanks for taking a look! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T14:28:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/417/41711482e219959b9d5388327d1f3f54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StayToasty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
