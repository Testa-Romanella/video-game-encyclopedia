Once a piece of food is cooked try to get it to land on the serving tray being held by the waiter behind you.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDo your best to not burn the food or have uncooked food land on the serving tray. If a piece of food lands on the floor then it's game over because there is no 5 second rule.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCompete for a high score with your friends as you climb the leader boards, see how much you can keep off of the floor and for how long.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nUpdates\r\n<p><strong>1.5.0<br/></strong></p><ul><li>Compiled game using Gamemaker Studio 2 instead of 1.4\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>1.3.3</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Modified hit boxes on player and food items, making food easier to hit when facing left. </li></ul>\n<p><strong>1.3.2</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Updated the tutorial to make some aspects of game play easier to understand.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>1.3.1</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fixed a glitch where some food items moved faster when they were thrown by the NPC</li><li>Fixed a glitch that caused advertisements to obstruct UI elements</li><li>Added a tutorial</li></ul>\r\nLinks\r\n<ul>\n<li>Pixel Kitchen Homepage</li>\n<li>Designed, Programmed, Sound and Sprites by @learyt_tekuzo</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e53/e53840035e1f1b75905a901553b705e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tekuzo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
