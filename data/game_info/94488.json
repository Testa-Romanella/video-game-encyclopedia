You take control of an amorphous blob of magical gum, summoned into servitude by a haughty wizard.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Background</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tGum+ is a remake and expansion of my 2014 game Gum, which is available for free here (\r\n\thttp://gamejolt.com/games/gum/22785). Gum+ features 58 new levels, a new story, a redesigned world, and puzzling new obstacles. It also includes a full-featured level editor. Basically, the only thing that <em>wasn't </em>added is more color!</p><p>\n<strong>Gameplay</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tAs a wad of animated gum, you travel the land getting yourself into and out of sticky situations. Use your adhesive properties to push and pull blocks to solve mind-bending puzzles. In later worlds, new obstacles such as bombs, spikes, and crumbling floors will provide an even greater challenge.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tComplete levels in the lowest possible number of moves and earn trophies that will help you unlock new worlds.
