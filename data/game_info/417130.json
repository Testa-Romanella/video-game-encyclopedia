This game will bring back\u00a0your childhood memories -- in physical form!<br/></p>\n<p>In this local-multiplayer game, there is one Catcher and up to two Runners. The\u00a0Runners should take the chance to move and\u00a0hide themselves from the Catcher's eyes. The Runners' goal is to move to the exit of the prison, while the Catcher's is to catch them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Background picture shows one cuboid controller and two cube controllers. Red/green buttons for switching the light, and yellow button for creeping. The movable cube controllers does not have a bottom so players can use it to cover the figure.<br/></p>\n<p>When the light is green, the\u00a0Runners can creeping by pushing the\u00a0button. When the light turns red, after a short notice\u00a0the Runners need use their controllers to cover their figures or they'll get caught, and need to start from the beginning. The Catcher controls the games pace: they\u00a0can switch\u00a0the light from green to red and vice versa, but they need to hit the button a lot in order to\u00a0recharge the switch. So life is difficult for all players: all of them need to hit buttons as fast as possible!</p>\n<p>Each Runners has got 3 lives. If all lives are used up, they lose, and the Catcher wins the game. If any of the Runners reach the exit of the prison, they win and the Catcher loose.</p>\n<p>For beginners, the game mainly tests their\u00a0reaction speeds.\u00a0But the game becomes\u00a0more tricky as your skills grow\u00a0--\u00a0its a\u00a0physical party\u00a0game that you play with people around you.\u00a0Try to fool your friends with fake actions!</p>\n<p>Note that our controllers are not essential: one keyboard is enough to control up to 3 players. But with these buttoned boxes, the game is more exciting -- just think of\u00a0smashing on the buttons as fast as you can!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T03:04:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23b/23b29f2a4a7ab3e6ada36d9c328477cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["paradox-glitch", "NickAffect", "Jedgar3006", "Veguista", "mikatsuki"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
