I used some assets from pop! horror city, and the stills were done by preposterous-panda. There was supposed to be this epic boss fight at the end, but I ran out of time. Turns out an hour isn't much time. Enjoy?</p><p>There's three endings, prettymuch one ending if you go out, one if you stay home, and another one if you use your computer. That's pretty much it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64b/64bdbb5f9c31293bf96832e2166a99ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bombi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
