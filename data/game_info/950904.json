Their presence aims to destroy everything in their path: people, schools, malls, and fields. By deliberately targeting agriculture and agricultural infrastructure, the Russian military wants to cause an economic and famine crisis in Ukraine and far from its borders.\r\n</p>\n<p>As a wheat farmer, you cultivate your fields in the game. But farmers in Ukraine don't have it that easy. As you harvest your wheat, missiles will fly into your field from the nearby front line and set it on fire. Stay strong to collect as much harvest as possible, as many rely on it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: The game contains imagery and sounds that might be triggering.\u00a0\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The game is best experienced with headphones.
