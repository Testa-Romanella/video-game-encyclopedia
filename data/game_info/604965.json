Your aim is to get him enough of a caffeine rush to keep him moving without getting a caffeine overdose (from too much coffee) or extreme fatigue (from too little coffee).<br/><br/><strong>Game Instructions</strong><br/>Press the Space key to jump. Hold Space key for longer to get a higher jump. <br/><br/>The game ends when 1 minute has passed or Geoff has either a caffeine overdose or extreme fatigue. When it is game over, press R to restart the game.<br/><br/><strong>Comments</strong><br/>This game was made for Trijam #120. It is my very first game for a game jam. I spent 5 hours producing it and just wanted to experience a game jam rather than heavily focus on the 3 hour time constraint. <br/><br/>\n<strong>Credits</strong><br/>All sprites are drawn by me and sprite backgrounds were made transparent using remove.bg<br/>Audio used is royalty-free and was composed by Heiko Kl\u00fch - https://www.proudmusiclibrary.com/en/track/melodee-1\u00a0 <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T07:58:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/834/834155e992c8b2a714747bd0814c7651.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ExcaliburLily"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
