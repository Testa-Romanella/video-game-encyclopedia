(or simply knock them out).<br/><br/><br/>Raise a half-demon to join your team during the fights! (Unless your traveling companions decide that this demon should not be born ... They will then carry out an abortion.)<br/><br/>and be careful not to kill innocent people!<br/><br/><br/>Before to start your journey, you need to select a skill:<br/><br/>-The Blood of Jesus : to be sure to respawn one time cause without this skill the respawn is random (it depends that the mood of the Death! )<br/><br/>-Treasure Hunter : to find more items!<br/><br/>-The eye of the Asclepios : to keeps some diseases away but this has no effect on \"divine diseases\" like stigmas (you will have to find the remedy yourself)<br/><br/>-Master of the sacred fire (The famous spell of the legend about the 3 marauders) : keeps the wolves away.<br/><br/>-Supplementary food rations : 5 food rations instead of 2.<br/><br/>-Seventh son of the seventh son : 7 lives instead of 3 but no ending when you finish the game!<br/><br/>...or no skill (If you already finished games like Ghosts\u2019n Goblins and Dark Soul without losing 1 single life!! )<br/><br/>During the journey, keep an eye on the amount of food rations and spare wheels and get ready to fight regularly.<br/>In addition to fighting you will have to deal with other dangerous  situations. Pray that diseases and wolves do not decimate your crew.<br/>Like in all good trips, pleasant moments like the camp or fishing alternate with fights against gigantic bosses!<br/>You can see some on theses ugly monsters into the screenshots!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T02:36:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5e/b5e7420754aeac23b700b24790d06d50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Choloco"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Choloco"], "esrb_rating": null}
