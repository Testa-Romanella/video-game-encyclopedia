{"id": 362414, "slug": "remembery", "name": "REMEMBERY", "name_original": "REMEMBERY", "description": "<p>This is a small game designed and built for the Design and Game Jam 2019. The theme was <em>Compete</em> so I designed a game that might provoke similar feelings of pressure as competition does. The goal is simple, you have to survive for as long as possible -- by disarming bombs that travel to your tower from all sides! <br/></p>\n<p>The disarm code\u00a0appears briefly where the bomb appears, but is overwritten when the next bomb appears at that location. You must select the bomb, and input the correct code to disarm it. Incorrect codes will lock the bomb, and it will inevitably hit your tower and explode. When your tower health is 0, the game is over.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong>The current version is a rough prototype, as such it only supports Mac with a PS4 controller. I will add some polish, and make builds for Windows + XBox controllers. I'll also add a keyboard version. But that will be dependent on how busy I am with other things (I'm sorry).<br/></p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\nIntro Screen\r\n<p>X to view high scores<br/>O to start game<br/></p>\r\nMain Game Screen\r\n<p>\n<em>Left joystick to move cursor.<br/></em><em>R1 to select bomb<br/></em>Triangle, Square, Circle, and X buttons to disarm</p>\r\nHigh Score Screen\r\n<p>D-Pad (up and down) for enter high score.
