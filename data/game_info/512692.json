Start to play with different backgrounds, different mechanics and different camera angles.</p>\n<p>There are <strong>100</strong> level for you!<br/>Deal with the challenge of freezing time at the right time, or passing the portal at the right time! Sometimes not hitting the wood can turn your ax!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes some <strong>easter eggs</strong> waiting you!</p>\n<p>Break the logs in everywhere!
