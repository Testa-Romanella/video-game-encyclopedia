{"id": 854384, "slug": "sakura-alien-2", "name": "Sakura Alien 2", "name_original": "Sakura Alien 2", "description": "In this visual novel Takagi Haru is a normal university student with an abundance of love for the stars. As a member of his university\u2019s astronomy club, alongside the sweet but somewhat ditzy Hiyori, Haru means to devote his life to the stars. He doesn\u2019t have any time to mess around with cute girls\u2026<br/><br/>At least, that\u2019s what he always thought \u2013 until an alien princess from another planet, Ena, lands on his lap, and declares herself to be his future wife.<br/><br/>Haru ends up taking Ena in, as she has nowhere else to go, and Ena and Hiyori soon hit it off. Now, the three of them are good friends (or perhaps something more) \u2013 but malevolent forces are seeking to undermine their relationship.<br/><br/>A new professor has arrived at Haru\u2019s university. Her name is Professor Sakai, and she composes herself in a beautiful, elegant manner. She is undoubtedly alluring, and Haru is soon drawn to her \u2013 but Professor Sakai seems to have her sights set on Ena.<br/><br/>Has Professor Sakai discovered Ena\u2019s secret identity as a runaway alien princess \u2013 and what does she mean to do with Ena?<br/><br/>That\u2019s something Haru has to figure out, else Ena might soon find herself in a sticky situation. <br/><br/><br/>Ena is an alien princess who comes from a far-off planet called Corval. She was raised as a member of alien royalty, and she\u2019s used to the finer things in life. She isn\u2019t a snob, however, and she enjoys nothing more than lounging around Haru\u2019s apartment in one of his old button-up shirts, eating snacks and reading manga.<br/>Ena is a cheerful, bubbly girl, and she\u2019s capable of brightening up anybody\u2019s day with a single smile. If she wasn\u2019t already an alien princess, she might make a good idol!<br/><br/><br/>Hiyori is a kind-natured girl one year Haru\u2019s senior, and the president of the astronomy club. She might be even more obsessed with the stars than Haru, as she seems to believe, owing to a star-shaped birthmark on her chest, that she herself is an extraterrestrial.<br/>Hiyori\u2019s parents are both exceedingly wealthy, but she doesn\u2019t seem to get along with them very well. She doesn\u2019t often talk about her family, and would far rather hang out with Haru and Ena.<br/><br/><br/>Professor Sakai (given name unknown) is a newbie professor at Haru and Hiyori\u2019s university. She might look cool and mature, with her icy intellect and her dark, sophisticated fashion sense, but she\u2019s actually something of a klutz: a fact she\u2019s very embarrassed about.<br/>She seems to have taken an especial interest in Ena: a development which causes Haru no shortage of stress. Professor Sakai might be pretty, but what, exactly, is she plotting\u2026?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T04:20:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/812/812901560a2e221c76aa6f0bc8626179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Winged Cloud"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Winged Cloud"], "esrb_rating": null}
