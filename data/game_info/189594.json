This is the earliest playable build. Please not, I have more planned for this game and it is not in any way complete. A lot of the assets used are placeholder and will be replaced in the final game.</p><p>The main aim of the game is to get through each level by reaching the end point, the only controls for this game is clicking with the mouse to jump your character towards it. There are several different mechanics you will have to face, from moving platforms, to doors that have to be remotely opened, to platforms that crumble if you stay on them too long.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this early version and hope you leave some feedback below on how I could improve the game, or any bugs you've found.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc2/bc23e543f9a050831508f066b939f784.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lee Kempton"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
