Fight many different enemy types from fast robots that carry bombs to towering lizard people who will smack you around. Fight also against different kinds of bosses, that can be more ranged or melee oriented, all with their own special moves and abilities. Players, if they survive a number of rounds/waves, will be able to choose from a wide range of different perks or abilities and upgrade them later on to give them an edge as the waves get harder and harder the longer they survive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T03:06:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbf/fbf590a1dc5e323974e574ce195c4f2c.jpg", "website": "https://www.blackbansheestudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlackBanshee Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BlackBanshee Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
