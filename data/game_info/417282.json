The only goal in this game is to crush your friends in arena-like environments with various hazardous obstacles and powerful pickups. Make your opponents fear you and\u00a0the trusty revolver, control the crowd with the dynamite or assert dominance with a shield applied.</p>\r\nI want to play the game\r\n<p>The game only supports gamepads, from 2 up to 4 players. Once all controllers are hooked up, they will be able to join the ingame lobby.</p>\r\nControls - Lobby\r\nMoves the player aroundJoins the lobby / Starts the gameQuits the lobby / Stops the countdownNavigates through the game settingsSwitch skinSwitch team\r\nControls - Map\r\nMoves the player aroundAims with certain powerupsDashUse powerup (shoot, throw, etc.)Options/StartPauseUnpauseRestart gameQuit to lobby\r\nMaps\r\n<ul><li>Lava</li></ul>\n<p>Avoid patches of flaming hot magma, or terrorize your enemies by tossing them in.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Western</li></ul>\n<p>Alive or dead,\u00a0It's your choice.

Vehicles hit hard and fling players around unexpectedly.</p>\r\nPickups\r\n The REVOLVER\r\n<p>A trusty six shooter to settle things for good. (Contains 6 bullets)</p>\r\n The WHIP\r\n<p>The whip can be quite unpredictable and hard to handle, but successfully hitting a target can cause a lot of damage and unwanted momentum. (Can be used 5 times)</p>\r\n The DYNAMITE\r\n<p>Can be thrown to cause an explosion in a small area after half a second that damages and pushes other players away. Instantly explodes if collides with other players, vehicles, laser beams, etc. (Can be thrown once)</p>\r\n The SHIELD\r\n<p>Using this item causes the player to be rendered invincible from damage of any type. However shielded players\u00a0can still die from falling out of ships or staying out of map for long.\u00a0(Lasts for 5 seconds)</p>\r\nI'm a huge nerd with glasses\r\n<p>The source code of the game is public and\u00a0can be accessed on Github.</p>\r\nSources?\r\n<ul><li>Most textures were based on tilesets from RPG Maker 2000</li><li>The sounds are mostly from Valve's DotA2\u00a0(sourced from\u00a0Wiki) - To avoid copyright issues these sounds will be replaced</li><li>The faces of the players are images of me and some of my friends (since this project started out as a fun little internal party game) and also Marty Robbins from an album cover</li></ul>\r\nWhat do I owe ya?\r\n<p>The game is completely free of charge (and will always be), but if you feel like supporting me you can buy me a coffee at Ko-fi.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T03:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/8464f97a444b664421059647eb218626.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atka"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
