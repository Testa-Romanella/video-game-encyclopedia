Carefully crafted constraints will help you be creative regardless of your writing skills. The minimal design gives you space to focus, explore and express yourself. No achievements, no scoring, no leaderboard. It's about you and the words spending quality time together.<br/><br/>A game session can take from 5 minutes to... well, hours. It all depends on how carried away you get. Sometimes you just want a little distraction, and sometimes it gets more introspective. Both are great ways to enjoy the game!<br/><br/>Pick words!Compose!Enjoy and Share!<h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li> <strong>Thousands of words</strong> to choose from!<br/></li><li> <strong>Four beautiful pixel art backgrounds</strong> available, one per season!<br/></li><li> <strong>An Inspiring chip-tune soundtrack</strong> made by the talented c.diffin!<br/></li><li> <strong>Gif recording system:</strong> share your art with the world!<br/></li><li> <strong>Streamer-friendly!</strong> Ask your viewers for advice, or have a writing workshop all together!<br/></li><li> <strong>Asynchronous multiplayer-ish!</strong> \"Shared Game\" mode allows players to compose with the same word set using a clever password system.

Why not send it like a digital postcard?<br/>Maybe it'll be personal, so you'll simply keep it close. As a souvenir.<br/>Maybe it won't make much sense. That's okay, things don't always have to make sense.<br/>Maybe you just won't like it. That's okay too, writing is hard. You can try again later.<br/><br/>Point is, I can't tell what you'll get out of it.<br/>But it's probably worth exploring!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T06:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/781/7816dcffaed8bba224ecfdddf9818c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MarechalBanane"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MarechalBanane"], "esrb_rating": null}
