In this unique VR story, for the first time you'll experience floating in zero gravity.<br/><br/>At this place you'll meet <strong>two old brothers living a surprisingly ordinary life</strong>.  Seems like nothing in this chaotic world would disturb their lonely and slow routine. <strong>Until one day...</strong><br/><br/><h3>FEATURES</h3><br/><br/><ul><li> A <strong>16</strong> minutes long experience<br/></li><li> <strong>2</strong> <strong>brothers</strong> with very opposite characters<br/></li><li> <strong>2</strong> unique <strong>endings</strong><br/></li><li> The ability to experience <strong>floating in zero gravity</strong> for the <strong>1st</strong> time<br/></li><li> A singular <strong>philosophic and moving</strong> story about dialogue and differences</li></ul><br/><h3>CREATORS</h3><br/><br/>Gravity VR is written and directed <strong>by Amir Admoni and Fabito Rychter</strong> who have been working together for the last 10 years. The partnership yielded movies, TV shows and plays that have collected 71 international awards and travelled to more than 120 festivals. Gravity VR is their first virtual reality project together. But definitely not the last.<br/><br/>A few words from one of the director's interview :<br/><br/>'The story touches important themes like polarization, lack of dialogue and irreconcilable differences. We follow two brothers that have been tied together their whole lives but even so develop completely different points of views about how things are at the present time, how things will be in the near future and what they should do about it. <br/><br/>They inhabit a chaotic world with so much noise that it becomes impossible to listen properly to what the other is trying to say. <strong>Without dialogue there's no exchange, no agreement, no middle ground.</strong> Both are firmly locked in their own views and that is enough to make living together unbearable.<br/><br/>I am sure this whole plot must seem fairly familiar to people in many countries right now.'<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-09T03:52:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d2/1d23f2a5c1baf3b18aa65b929941c960.jpg", "website": "https://www.gravityvr.site/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Delirium XR"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Astrea"], "esrb_rating": null}
