The basic playing method is similar to billiards, but each ball is a rectangular square with blood. You need to consider not only the launch's direction and strength but also the square's rotation. Whether you want to knock the enemy out of bounds or hit greater damage, whether you cooperate with your teammates to attack cautiously or recklessly depends on your judgment of the current situation.<br/>In addition, each frog has its unique skills. You can constantly cultivate frogs to improve their skills. With special map props, you can play your style of combat.<h3>Feature</h3><ul><li>4 kinds of frogs with different skills</li><li>5 map special mechanisms</li><li>12 levels</li></ul><h3>Ps</h3>At present, the content is not rich enough, but if players like it, I will add new map mechanisms and characters later.
