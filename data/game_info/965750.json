In Spaceminers: Gold Runner, our exclusive pre-alpha release, players can jump over obstacles, dodge incoming dangers, and shoot holographic enemies while training to become a Spaceminer. This is only the first of three planned game modes as part of the Spaceminers Academy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is the year 2169. A ruthless, corrupt regime known as Author1D has control of the Spesitos star system and its neighbours. Driven by their greed for power, they have spread their influence across the knownverse, seeking slaves to work in the production lines of Grain, a most valuable and important resource. A brave soldier named Tribus was able to establish the first organised rebellion united against Author1D, naming them the Spaceminers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow, brave and true Cadets are being admitted to the Spaceminers Academy, hidden deep in the lower chambers of a gargantuan ziggurat hiding many secrets behind its ancient stone walls.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-01T05:50:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb869e4c5c06196985880c4d8c92fb5b.jpg", "website": "https://www.spaceminers.xyz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Spaceminers"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Spaceminers"], "esrb_rating": null}
