I'm back with a brand new game I made, ''Save The Galaxy''. Save The Galaxy is a game which you play as a ship in space, shooting at anything that is in your way. You start with 100 health points, and your only weapon are bullets fired from the ship's gun. This features 4 types of enemies, each of those is unique and different than the other! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or complaints, leave it in the comment section on the game's page. Much thanks to anyone who downloads it.</p>\n<p>Peace</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T18:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/651/6511ab45338e454df262e2e1766374a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rAjke"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
