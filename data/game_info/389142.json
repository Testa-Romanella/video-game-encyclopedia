It is built with Unity and with the help of several assets purchased in the Unity Asset Store. I know it is not perfect, but I think it turned out pretty good considering this is my first real game (except a few mobile and VR minigames) and with a timelimit of 5 month total.</p><p>Feel free to leave feedback and I hope you'll have a good time playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T03:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5a66b0cbf447c26e1c3b98516b93020.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beinomat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
