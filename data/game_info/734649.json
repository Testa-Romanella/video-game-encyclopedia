He has to stop the plans of Big Bad Dr. Gyoniku and his henchmen, along with seven other rat and ratlike characters. And a kangaroo whose name means &quot;rabbit&quot;.</p>\n<p>This game is surprising for its lower difficulty compared to other Mega-clones, especially once you get their patterns down (or have their weaknesses). Despite this, it&#39;s still fun to play, mostly because of the completely original concept.</p>\n<p>The game is available here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T19:34:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/788/788e042b3d27cb3ca5e0aa91ae90599a.jpg", "website": "http://nezutako.com/works/game/nezumiman/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
