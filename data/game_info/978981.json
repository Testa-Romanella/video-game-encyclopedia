It\u2019s somewhere in Hacksaw Springs, and everything is pointing you toward the Lost and Found inside\u2026 a\u2026 Clown Convention?<br/><h3>Tools</h3>In Part of You, you will have to use a variety of tools in order to solve problems around Hacksaw Springs. Some of the tools you\u2019ll be using include:<br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>The Flipper:</strong>  The flipper will turn any facial feature upside down. Need somebody to look away? Turn their frown upside down? Make someone look a little goofy, generally speaking? The flipper is for you!<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>The Stamp:</strong> Ever needed someone to have a different person\u2019s mouth? Eyes? \u2026 you have? Huh, that\u2019s weird. With the stamp, you can clone facial features and put them onto other people! Want to make someone look like someone else? Make Millard Morawn a chad? Make a clone army? The stamp has you covered!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>The Mask:</strong> Missing your own identity? No problem \u2013 just steal someone else\u2019s! Fraud isn\u2019t real, and nobody will come after you. It may not be the best disguise, but\u2026 people love talking to familiar faces.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Googly Eyes:</strong> Have you ever taken a pair of googly eyes and put them on your eyelids, trying to balance them and pretend they\u2019re your own eyes? Now you can forcibly stick them onto someone else\u2019s eyes!<h3>Hacksaw Springs</h3><br/>Hacksaw Springs is usually a bit of a snoozefest \u2013 your average town, your average drama. Now that Funny Business is renting out the convention center for Clown Around 20XX, things have been pretty hectic! The Flea Market is as busy as ever, with new stalls popping up. The Parking Lot is filled with pop-up shops and protests. To top it all off, the incompetent town security is more preoccupied with googly eyes than A BOMB!<h3>Characters</h3>Over 100 unique characters fill the streets (and roofs?) of Hacksaw Springs. Help out the friendly townsfolk, and they might just help you in return! A dedicated employee of a three-years-defunct video store, a noseless mechanic in love with his goil, a tumbleweed with a warrant? All that and more as you rediscover who you are\u2026<h3>Need a Little Funny HaHa?</h3>The more you play, the more characters you\u2019ll gain access to! Have a field day making the funniest faces Hacksaw Springs has to offer!<br/><h3>Finding your Identity</h3>Part of You is all about finding your identity, as well as us finding ours. This is a game about the absurdity of the world and the silliness we all face every morning when we look at ourselves in the mirror. Part of You and Hacksaw Springs welcomes you, no matter who you are\u2026 as long as you don\u2019t have coulrophobia.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-25T13:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905cc3656a2a8e4bda7d76c4b4922384.jpg", "website": "https://www.teamsometimesy.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Sometimes Y"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Sometimes Y"], "esrb_rating": null}
