I-It's an interesting premise... but I feel like it could easily get out of hand. A lot of people who play it probably end up just taking out their frustrations on imaginary versions of their bullies. I guess I understand it, but... it's kind of scary, you know?\"</em></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u2606</strong><strong>\u2606</strong><strong>\u2606</strong><strong><strong><strong>\u2606\u2606 -\u00a0</strong></strong></strong>Chihiro Fujisaki </strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\"I rate The Experience as a 4/5 stars, I think it is a great concept. I loved the concept of an AI God communicating with humans in a game made by humans. I believe, the experience can truly be a great method to connect with the youth. It is a great way to show them the wonders and realities of the universe. I really enjoyed my time in the game and being able to experience the many things that existed in the universe. It was truly a great experience.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u2606</strong><strong>\u2606</strong><strong>\u2606</strong><strong><strong>\u2606</strong>- God</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T05:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c087bdd2e5f520857208980a5a73a5e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["funnyfumohaha"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
