{"id": 47388, "slug": "color-jumper", "name": "Color Jumper", "name_original": "Color Jumper", "description": "Color Jumper is an abstract, color-based puzzle platformer which focuses on fast, precise movement to navigate your surroundings. Inspired by hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy, Downwell, VVVVVV, and many others, your goal in Color Jumper is to reach the exit. You control a block with a different color on each side. Colored platforms are only solid when in contact with the connecting color of your block. Each jump rotates your block, creating a world where each jump must be planned carefully, turning levels into a twisting high-speed parkour race to the finish.Featuring<ul><li>Elegant and minimalistic level design<br/></li><li>Blisteringly fast gameplay<br/></li><li>Incredibly tight and responsive controls modeled after Super Meat Boy and other classics<br/></li><li>Over 100 levels of progressive difficulty<br/></li><li>Four unique and challenging boss fights<br/></li><li>Hard to reach collectibles which unlock additional extreme challenge levels<br/></li><li>Time and rotation goals for each level<br/></li><li><strong>Fully integrated colorblind mode</strong> which replaces the colors with patterns for accessibility<br/></li><li>Dedicated speedrun mode</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fb/4fb20f8b5889221fbc5df4a8e235b910.jpg", "website": "http://tallbeardstudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 18}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tallbeard Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tallbeard Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
