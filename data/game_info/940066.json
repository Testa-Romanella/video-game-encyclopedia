Besides the score, I had to create the start, pause, win and lose menus. <br/>I don't know if it's because it's been so long I created UI, or just my confidence making me work slowly, but the result was that I finished a stable state for the game (clearly not a proper one considering how I handled <em>FSM</em>s' transitions and naming in the end...) with only 8 minutes left that I wanted to keep to correct the bugs I would find while testing.\u00a0</p><p>After in fact finding some bugs, all I could do as bonus addition with the remaining time was put a \"Speed x2\" button, quickly handled with one event changing the pitch of my Music Source.<br/><br/>At least the game is playable and not (too ?) buggy, even if it's not as good as I wanted it to be.<br/><br/><strong>UPCOMING FEATURE</strong>S :</p><p>Here are my ideas I couldn't use/ develop because of the time limit.<br/>I'll continue the development to include all of them soon.</p><p>- Change of <strong>character model</strong> to the King character, from <em>Polygon Fantasy Kingdom - Synty Studios</em> asset.</p><p>- Setting around 6/8 animations of posing from <em>Mixamo </em>and play one randomly each time the player would move, while also having the camera getting really close to the character so we could spectate the agility and beauty of <strong>King Baguette </strong>posing. (not sure if it would work with Speed 2 though).</p><p>- Add a blue orb spawning every measure (so every 4 beats), and when taken, that would stop <strong>PainAuChocolat </strong>from playing drums for 2 measures. <br/></p><p>- Speaking of <strong>PainAuChocolat</strong>, I also wanted to put him and his drum as a \"floating around\" game object. Like, seeing (and hearing) him come from the left side of the screen and going upward while rotating on himself, until he disappeared from the top of the screen. And after some seconds, seeing him reappear from the right side while still floating around from one side to the other...</p><p>- Add <strong>particles </strong>when there's a  collision between the <strong>Player</strong> and an <strong>Orb</strong>.<br/></p><p>\u00a0 <br/></p><p><strong>ASSETS LIST</strong> : <br/>Here are the <strong> assets </strong>I used (or thought of using) for this little project :</p><p><em>- Koreaographer - Sonic Bloom<br/>- FSM PlayMaker - Hutong Games<br/>- Fresh Bread - Megan Alcock<br/>- Polygon Fantasy Kingdom - Synty Studios<br/>- Skybox Series Free</em></p><p><strong>Thank you</strong> for reading/ playing, please don't hesitate to <em>share your thoughts/ any advice</em> you would have in the comments down below so I can <strong>improve myself</strong> !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T06:09:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f88/f88afe2713af3cd674e4393b93c99225.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Haoro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
