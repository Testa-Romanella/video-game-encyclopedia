How about placing blocks forever?</p>\n<p>Based on Futilitris by Twinbeard Studios, Tetromino Chill is a game about chilling out and placing some blocks. Best when paired with some music or a movie.</p>\n<p>Since Futilitris is getting more difficult to play as Flash retires, I decided to re-create it as an exercise. Tetromino Chill can be played in your web browser on itch, or downloaded for Windows and Linux below.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T02:40:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9beaf62091723672379753271e5ac57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Dragon Chasing Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
