{"id": 484797, "slug": "accro", "name": "AccrO", "name_original": "AccrO", "description": "AccrO is a Full Acrobatic Quadcopter Simulator, with realistic flight behavior and complex physics simulation. A training tool for freestyle drone enthusiasts.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrom the drone community for the drone community, AccrO allows new pilots to improve muscular memory and try different setups. Hardboiled veterans can tweak flight controller rates and thrust-to-weight ratio matching their favorite quad, aiming to create new acrobatic tricks in a simulated environment.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAccrO is an acrobatic simulator, not an arcade-style game. There is no scoring system or step-by-step progression. Controlling a full acrobatic quadcopter will be as hard as in real life. To run the simulator, you will need a 4 Axis controller (USB remote controller, XBOX360 gamepad, or a 4-axis joystick) and at least a mid-level graphics card, please check the system requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAccrO is under development, the scenario is growing with obstacles suggested by the community and your suggestions are very very important, please check the community hub.
