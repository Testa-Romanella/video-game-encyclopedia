Prototype", "description": "<p>This is a prototype sonic-style platformer with some ideas taken from Pizza tower, featuring a gay punk armadillo.</p>\n<p>There is only one level, the tutorial map. There's a goal ring but it doesn't do anything, so you only get the satisfaction of reaching it.<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Move - Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Jump - A</p>\n<p>\"Trick\" - S</p>\n<p>Special Moves:</p>\n<p>Ball Form- If you hold down the armadillo will curl into a ball. He picks up speed faster on slopes while a ball.<br/></p>\n<p>Mach Speed- If you go fast enough you can smash certain blocks.</p>\n<p>Mach Turn- If you press the trick button and the opposite direction to your movement, while at mach speed, you will enter a slide that redirects your speed in a different direction.</p>\n<p>Drill Dive- Press Down and Trick while airborne. The armadillo will dive directly downward at high speed. If you are on a slope can be redirected into horizontal speed.</p>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>- The armadillo should fall off of walls when he's too slow, but that's not implemented yet. I want to refactor the code first.</p><p>- The armadillo has trouble sticking to convex-downward slopes. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T06:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/3073acc97d38f8c4f975a539e40c7883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Woodhouse3D"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
