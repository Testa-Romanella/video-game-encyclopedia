The only problem is you\u2019re a bit of a wallflower. Try to get your cup onto the coaster without bumping into any of the party guests, but be cautious. As the night goes on, the other aliens at the party start to get more and more OUT OF CONTROL\u2026 and less worried about personal space.</p>\n<p>The original concept of the game was that you\u2019d have an arm connected to your hand and you wouldn\u2019t be able to control the arm. Obstacles would be able to push and pull the arm while you tried to reach the end of the level and each level would become more erratic. Unfortunately, this is our very first game and we ran out of time while trying to figure out how we would do that. We\u2019re still very proud of what we managed to accomplish with little to no experience in programming.</p>\n\n<p>Controls\r\n  </p>\n<p>Left/Right ------ Mouse\r\n  </p>\n<p>Forward -------- Mouse Left Click\r\n  </p>\n<p>Drop Cup ------- Mouse Right Click\r\n  </p>\n<p>Space ------------ Restart\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing our very first game.</p>\n<p>Love,\r\n  </p>\n<p>LaddLabs\r\n  </p>\n<p>Noah Dohanich, Lukas Gerlach, Serena Olsen\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:13:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e7/3e723e5920c5a406d08878364bfe15ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LaddLabs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
