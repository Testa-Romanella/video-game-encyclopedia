Press S to shoot/get your tongue out and\u00a0 press A to jump in Pyoro 3.</p>\r\nOkay, so what DID go wrong? Glad you asked!\r\n<p>- I knew I'd be too busy this week. But people wanted to see me join, so I caved in when 2 days were left. I needed some help with the art tho, so I looked around and got in contact with the first 2 people offered help. <strong>Not the smartest move.</strong></p>\n<p>- My plan was to only use the first 3 days. <strong>This was one of the biggest reasons why the game didn't end up being finished.</strong></p>\n<p>- My first idea was to make a Pyoro based platformer.\u00a0I decided this idea before the theme was finalized and revealed. <strong>This was a bad idea, I should've waited until the jam have officially started.</strong></p>\n<p>- I knew the theme a bit before the jam started, as I'm the organizer,\u00a0but didn't start developing the idea with the theme in mind until the jam started.</p>\n<p>- I used an engine I was unfamiliar with, Game Maker Studio 2.3 Beta. <strong>This was a bad idea because my goal was to make a somewhat ambitious game.</strong></p>\n<p>- I made a platformer engine, which took some time since the workflow in GMS 2.3 is kind of different than what I'm used to, but it wasn't much of an issue.</p>\n<p>- I used some \"libraries\" I wrote that didn't\u00a0have any previous testing, so they caused some issues.\u00a0<strong>Again, wasn't the best idea.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- I also had to deal with some issues due to the version of GMS I was using being a beta. <strong>Again, took a huge risk here, even though it didn't cost me a ton of time overall.</strong></p>\n<p>- I changed my idea after half a day. I realized that my concept wasn't the most fun.\u00a0Therefore most of my former work got scrapped or ended up not getting utilized properly. I think this was actually a good choice, the original idea wouldn't even get this far.</p>\n<p>- My new idea was to expand the original minigame, but I\u00a0couldn't replicate the original as well as I thought I would have, and getting it accurate took more time than I expected. <strong>This caused my motivation to drop.</strong></p>\n<p>- My new idea ended up barely being what it was supposed to be, <strong>which brought my motivation down even more.</strong></p>\n<p>- I was nowhere near done after the first 2 days. And since I was busy that week\u00a0I had to take a 4 day break in the middle of the jam, I could work on the game between my schoolwork if I wanted but I thought that would be too exhausting for me.</p>\n<p>- It was hard for me return to the game and have the same level of excitement after my classes for the week ended.</p>\n<p>- The game was simply not shaping up to become something I was happy with.</p>\n<p>- I also was clearly not gonna make it, and my pace was slow due to my lack of motivation. <strong>I forced myself to do work, but it wasn't fun. Even an extension to the jam helped.</strong></p>\r\n- I missed the point. Having FUN. What's the point if you're joining jam and if you're not enjoying yourself. That was my biggest mistake. But I wanted to get something out, since this was my jam.\r\n<p>- And here we are, an unfinished game.</p>\n<p>I hope you guys don't repeat my mistakes in your future jams.</p>ALSO LISTEN TO THE GAME'S OST IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD:<p>https://soundcloud.com/catonator-1/sets/pyoro-u-soundtrack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:05:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bfbb644690a40fb2d192b5fa0b3afa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mors"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
