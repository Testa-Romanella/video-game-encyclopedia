{"id": 152433, "slug": "barcode", "name": "Barcode", "name_original": "Barcode", "description": "<p>\r\n\tThis is Barcode, an entertaining and mildly relaxing puzzle game about decoding randomly generated barcodes. The game has two modes: Normal, where you can calmly and infinitely decode barcodes (until you make a mistake), or Timed, also infinite, but you're under increasing time pressure to decode the barcodes within the time limit.</p><p>\r\n\tAlthough a tutorial is provided, you may want to go through it a few times and practice on normal mode, as it is initially quite difficult to get the hang of.</p><p>\r\n\tThe game could also potentially improve cognitive ability and the general problem solving speed of your brain, so if you're after a bit of brain training, this game might be ideal for you. As it's educational, you may be able to get away with playing at school or work. You could also impress your friends with your barcode-reading skills!</p><p>\r\n\tFuture plans include the addition of music to the game, and an Android port.</p><p>\r\n\tAny feedback would be brilliant!</p><p>\r\n\tEmail: thebarcodegame@gmail.com</p><p>\r\n\tDev Twitter: @MikeTheWayne_</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d7/8d7d0184f3999a40ec4c7fd395a6e533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MikeTheWayne"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
