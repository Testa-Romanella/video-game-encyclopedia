If you are looking for a more adult oriented challenging match 3 without all of the bright colors this is the game for you. In Beer Break you relive the heroes adventures on the battlefields while traveling the inns and bars of the period. There are several game types there you collect beer steins, spill blood to connected squares, beat a time limit, collect weapons, and more. This game is designed for an adult crowd so it is not going to give you hints on how to beat the level. It is not going to hold your hand and explain every step. You have to learn to play the game by trial and error.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Multiple Game Types<br/></li><li>Stats<br/></li><li>Leader boards<br/></li><li>Achievements<br/></li><li>No additional purchases required Play to Win</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T04:18:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12ecacd5dbef17c806827e4d7baca398.jpg", "website": "https://www.bigchibi.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Big Chibi"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Chibi"], "esrb_rating": null}
