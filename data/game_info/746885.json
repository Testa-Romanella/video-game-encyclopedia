I went down the route of propaganda and a 1984-style government where the player decides what to censor or not. Given some more work, I think this idea could work very well for a fully produced game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:07:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01c/01cef79167d17b1a6b1af750e7c09f8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aiguille Du Midi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
