On his journey, he will need to face obstacles and enemies who want to keep these people in the prison of sin.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n To win and see the lives freed, he will use the armor of God, the knowledge of the Word acquired during the walk, the prayer and the power of the Holy Spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n Standing firmly, girded with the belt of truth, wearing the breastplate of justice and having his feet shod with the readiness of the gospel of peace, young John will continue his journey in preaching the message of deliverance. Using the shield of faith to defend himself against the enemy's incessant attacks, the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, he will fight the good fight and keep his faith until the end of his journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThank you for contributing and participating in the project for the first version of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCarlos Martins - Blue Crab", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T10:27:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/868/868317b6fa490c2e675ec3bf542e47ed.jpg", "website": "https://www.bluecrabst.com/john-christian", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carlos Martins"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Carlos Martins - Blue Crab"], "esrb_rating": null}
