There are treasures along the way to discover which are useful and necessary against the Boss battle at the end. This game was not made to battle and fight your way through everything, it was made to think strategically in order to solve puzzles of sandbags and other objects in caves etc. This game features fun interactive events, weapons, armors, avoiding some objects, avoiding some monsters, using basic potions in a simple menu system! The game consists of 10 Levels not including Intro scene and 2 ending scenarios!
