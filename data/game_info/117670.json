{"id": 117670, "slug": "roomone", "name": "RoomOne", "name_original": "RoomOne", "description": "<p>At start, I wanted to create something using one of the shaders which I had developed recently - something which could be really clean with a quiet aesthetic - a project between Antichamber and BoxLife. This last convinced me that it was possible to create a solid project really addictive exploiting only a few simple mechanics. So I did RoomOne - a 3d puzzle in which you must collect 7 stars so as to increase your aptitudes, jumping higher and running faster, etc - trying to find a way in order to reach the next star. I guess that it could be really hard to break this game in less than 20 minutes, and I know that you have no many time to play with an oodles of projects which have been developed during this week-end. In consequence I did a video in which I finish the game in 2 minutes. Please try this project and give me a feedback, even if you have disliked it. Write a brief message and I will visit your own page too in order to test your project. Thank you for playing. I wish you the best ++<br/></p><p>WASD to move,</p><p>Space bar to jump,</p><p>R to restart,</p><p>Escape to quit,<br/></p><p>F12 to know your FPS,</p><p>Up/Down arrows to modify mouse sensitivity<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a21/a21bb8102e6f8107e5063e219ec078e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
