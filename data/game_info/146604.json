Some of the resources in the upper right hand corner are clickable as well. So food will fill you up, medicine heals you, and torches are placed in the level for lighting the way at night time. Torches also are used for cooking in the crafting menu, so it\u2019s good to have a lot of them! They\u2019ll burn out 15 seconds after placing.</p>\n<p>You need to keep crafting cannon balls to shoot, and building a kiln will let you craft cooler cannons. If you run out of cannons, you can still shoot, but it\u2019ll cost you health and you won\u2019t get a trajectory indicator.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to clear a level to proceed - just blast the crates you want and try not to break the black crates. Pressing the little green runner button will go to a new area and advance time a bit, but cost food (travel works up an appetite). The idea is to survive as long as possible, but the game doesn\u2019t currently get harder as you go.</p>\n<p>Planned additions:</p>\n<ul><li>More level configurations</li><li>Difficulty ramp (basically just dropping more black crates)</li><li>Time-based hunger</li><li>A day counter so you can say \u201cI got to day 5!\u201d or whatever</li></ul><p>Check out the post-jam version here!<br/>https://robotinker.itch.io/super-survival-cannon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/241fb6978410a923a270ab5f7a6cf9e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["robotinker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
