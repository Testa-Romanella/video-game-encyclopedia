Your goal is to survive and rescue the others who are trapped within the rig. You can do this with your trusty fire-axe which allows you to break through destructible objects. With the use of puzzle solving you can also find other ways to navigate the rig, these include, vent-crawling, making holes in certain walls, finding a keycard to grant access to a higher clearance area.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Lucy Bradbury: Programmer\u00a0and Level Designer</p>\n<p>Evan Wrynn: Programmer, Modeller and Multiplayer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jasmine Lepori: Concept Artist\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lucien Doe: Concept Artist</p>\n<p>Jamie Wood: Concept Artist\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chris Betts: 3D Modeller and Texture Artist\u00a0</p>\n<p>James Watt:\u00a0\u00a03D Modeller and Texture Artist\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T08:33:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d3c0813375a52fd6a86cd118d2fbc20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucy Bradbury"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
