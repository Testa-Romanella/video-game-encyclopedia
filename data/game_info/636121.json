This makes the ghost relatively easy to avoid, but you can use it to interfere with the other players to gain an advantage.\u00a0 Number of pellets are divisible by 2, 3, and 4 so any number of winners is possible and ties will properly be displayed on the end of game screen. Supports 2-4 players, therefore cannot be played alone. Sorry! Simply playing at the same time as someone else should have you join the same server.<br/><br/>Itch.io and Unity UI elements do not play well together, sorry about that!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T08:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b5/7b506613d112f3ac7f053a21e6a7604f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gabriel Desroches"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
