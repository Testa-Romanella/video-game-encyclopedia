The main focus of the gameplay lies in deciphering the Rubik's Cube, while the secondary aspect involves solving puzzles in small-scale scenarios.<h3>Levels</h3>We have four civilization fragments to restore. Restoring the Rubik's Cube at each stage involves an in-depth exploration of scientific principles, such as polar coordinates (representing reproduction), Newtonian gravity (representing money), circuit theory (representing religion), and Fourier transform (representing power). Those principles not only embody the scientific progress of human history, but also reflect fundamental issues of human society.<h3>Epilogue</h3>Every significant advancement in the field of natural science made by humanity serves as a means of reinforcing the social structure. Despite originating from pure curiosity, it invariably veers off course due to the powerful inertia of the social system.<br/>This phenomenon recurs at every stage of human social evolution: from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalist private ownership. Mathematics is utilized for taxation, while the information exchange facilitated by the internet progressively erects firewalls and censorship. Those all results into class solidification.<br/><br/>Even if humanity ultimately transitions to extinction, the exploitation of the scientific impartial stance by a select few powerful individuals will turn everything established by science into a double-edged sword poised over all of humanity.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-29T07:30:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/391/39131cc13df7777a6839cfd619cccc9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AQin_Gomeisa"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AQin_Gomeisa"], "esrb_rating": null}
