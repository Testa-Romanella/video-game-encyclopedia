A lot of this is going to change this is just the early prototype! You just have to go around killing GIANT LIZARDS while going to different levels killing more and more! There's no sound just yet or a way to go back to the hub world so you'll have to restart.\u00a0 There are only 3 levels. Find the Runes to access them!</p>\n<p>I will be updating it as much as I can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T07:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27b/27bbc0e0f8f1f5a27df4046c0b83f7e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["starlightgippy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
