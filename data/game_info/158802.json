Creating an interactive experience in which users can try out what it's like to volunteer gives people the opportunity to experience and understand the benefits of volunteering, without yet having to commit to a volunteering position. It is my hope that this Twine will encourage people to check out their local volunteering opportunities - a resource which I am proposing would be available in a collective list on the completed HappyVol website.</p><p>This Twine is not yet finished, and will likely later include more graphics to liven up the user's experience.</p><p>Photo credit: huffingtonpost.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d3/6d398cca50893ab63dff92b9dcf6069b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stories in Play"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
