Just experiment and have fun killing the mobs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can jump down to the right from spawn for a small world, there is also a little tower to practice wall jumping on.</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, glitches, or have any ideas for features, please let me know!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:12:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/271/2712d63b51ce2c25f4737fb579a094ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arridian"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
