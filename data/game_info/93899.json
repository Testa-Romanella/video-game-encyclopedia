A keyboard and mouse are required.</p><p>Voi was developed by Vec1. </p><p>Update: Since release as a capstone project, Voi has become a personal project and is being rebuilt from the ground up. It will probably be quite a while before it's ready for another release, and the game at the other end will probably be quite different, but this project is still kicking.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Non-Euclidean spaces</li>\n<li>Puzzles!</li>\n<li>Minimalistic art style</li>\n<li>Continued development</li><li>Custom engine</li></ul>\r\n\t\"An intelligent puzzler in an impossible structure.\"<p>\r\n\t- Alpha Beta Gamer.</p>\"Voi wants to play architectural peek-a-boo with you.\"\r\n\t<p>\t\t- Killscreen.</p>\"This game looks cool, feels cool, it's a very good student project...\"<p>- Foehammer.</p><p><strong>Installation:</strong><br/></p><p>Download zip file attached, extract and run the Voi executable.</p><p>If the game is having issues, try installing Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2013.</p><p><strong>The Team:</strong></p><p>\r\n\tThis game was created by the team of Vec1 which includes </p><ul><li>Pat Monaghan - Lead Programmer</li><li>Tim Volp - Programmer</li><li>Jared Ford - Programmer</li><li>Jackson Coll - Lead Designer</li></ul><p>You can follow to learn more about us at: https://www.facebook.com/vec1voi<br/>\n</p><p>You can also follow our Twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/vec1games</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ed/7ed844db9356b49a56afe9f758aca48d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vec1", "Patrick Monaghan", "Jared Ford", "timvolp", "JacksonColl"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
