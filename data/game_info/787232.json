Collect coins and get powerups from the cigarette machine!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Coins</strong>: there are coins scattered about throughout the map, the player can pick them up and use them in the cigarette machine to gain powerups.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to powerups:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are two types of powerups: spare tires and a plow. The player is able to equip these powerups to help them through the game!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The plow</strong>: When receiving the plow, the player can equip it onto their car if they do not already have a plow. The plow will allow the player to get through snow piles that block the road.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Spare tires</strong>: The player is only able to equip the spare tires when they have been slowed by road spikes.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Obstacles:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Snow Piles</strong>: They block the road. If the player hits a snow pile, it's game over unless they have a plow, in which case, it's game over for the snow pile!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Road Spikes</strong>: they puncture the player's tires, causing the vehicle to move slower. Replace punctured tires with spare tires and regain the vehicle's normal speed.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This game was created as a project for Game Development 1 based on the prompts:</p>\n\n<p>Three things:\u00a0</p>\n<p>a car with a broken tail light\u00a0</p>\n<p>a cigarette machine filled with something besides cigarettes\u00a0</p>\n<p>a mysterious coin</p>\n\n<p>By:</p>\n<p>Ryan Chan - Artist</p>\n<p>Ivan Ho - Programmer</p>\n<p>Joseph Jelinek - Programmer</p>\n<p>Beck Payne - Level Designer</p>\n<p>DaNice Pe Benito - Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T15:34:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94b216113efa385cc250102c391e51ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["briefjoe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
