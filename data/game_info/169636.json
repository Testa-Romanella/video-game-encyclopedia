I recommend trying to figure out things yourself from there, but if you don't want to or are unable to do so, here are the full instructions:</p>\n<p>-There is an action wheel at the top of the screen. It tells you what is the next action you'll perform. It always cycle (ex.\u00a0: Jump, slide, attack, then again jump, slide, attach, then again...)</p>\n<p>-If the action you have to perform and the one you can do are not the same, go through your action wheel by doing useless actions until you have the right one. For example, if you have to jump over a spike\u00a0but your next action is sliding, then slide quickly. Your next action might then be jumping, and you can do so.</p>\n<p>-Some people are confused by cats on level 3. You just have to ignore them: if you shoot them, you fail (shooting cats is evil!). Just pass through them as if they didn't exist.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!
