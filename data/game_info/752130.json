Dodge as much deadly spikes as possible, while using that sneaky portal to skip the hardest part and leave your friends behind in all that mess. While you're at it, honk at them to assert dominance.<h3>Build</h3>After you won the first round, build as much obstacles as you can. Make it difficult, build traps, spikes to smash all other cubes. But if you're really evil, build some secret path to get past that deadly stuff. Set some walls, portals and canons to boost yourself even more.<h3>Rage</h3>Now watch your friends struggling to get past the mess you built, honk at them while you jump past them. Take care for the obstacles they might have built, and race to ultimate victory.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T04:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/721/7211e983127dae21315cd7d75ebb21c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Creactstudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Creactstudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
