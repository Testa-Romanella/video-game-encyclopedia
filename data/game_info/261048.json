None of the sounds, models, or, textures are mine and this is my first game ever posted. There is also almost no sound. This is just for people to try it out and to get constructive criticism. This is based off of the video called \"The Hug\"\u00a0and this is going to be about Pandory but for now this is just Fredbear. Also he doesn't have any animations since I am not an artist/animator I am a programmer. Also don't worry it's not a virus. Please leave a comment on what you think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e0/5e0ea4cf40ab05efa44fd09123584737.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ivanything437"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
