One is a percussive beat, that speeds up until</p><p>the point that you will be graded on the two notes. If they are equal, you will gain a point. Right after, a new note will spawn, and the game will continue. </p><p>The second sound that you can hear is white noise, conveying to you at what point your pitch slider is within a note. When the white noise is high pitched, you are at the higher end of the note, meaning any more space-bar clicking will push you over the cutoff point and into the next note. When it is lower, you are at the low end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb4b0e37c07ec92de57e6a410ed9e896.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VocalSin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
