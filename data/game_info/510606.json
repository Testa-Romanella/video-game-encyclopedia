Done over quarantine in game maker studio\u00a0over ~3 months. Classic tower defense with towers that grow over time. Enemy art from here:\u00a0https://zapatopi.net/icon/\u00a0and all towers drawn with a mouse by yours truly.</p>\n<p>Click the dirt mounds to plant towers you have in your loadout.\u00a0Use the watering can to help them grow. The Yellow levels unlock new towers.\u00a0Hint, armored enemies have a flat damage reduction\u00a0so lower damage towers may not do much, I'll leave the rest for you to discover.</p>\n\n<p>-Phil</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:33:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b05c9e19c313c22826e8ebe892b45847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CastOfCrabs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
