Intelligent and human-like, they will spark a young woman's curiosity, who will dig deep into their origins and motivations to understand who they really are.\r\nAbout this demo\r\n<p>This is a demo\u00a0which contains about 10 minutes of gameplay that represent the first scene in the story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will play as a female protagonist, a young vlogger that just heard rumours about some mysterious sightings in a nearby forest and is more than ready to head in and take a look at what's happening around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This demo contains no voice acting, but you can activate auto-voicing by pressing V.
