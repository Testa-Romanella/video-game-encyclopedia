Build up your army and survive for a chaotic week!\r\n\n<p>Left click: Click on an ally to select it or click on an empty space to deselect</p>\n<p>Left click and drag : Select multiple ally units RTS style</p>\n<p>Right click : Move selected ally units around</p>\n\r\nTips:\r\n<p>- More food spawn during the day and more enemies during the night, split up to cover more ground or regroup accordingly.</p><p>- Bring food to your nest to spawn more allies, and put more allies in the nest together to spawn allies faster. But beware as you will not be able to defend yourself when you are in the nest.</p><p>- Allies cant attack if they are holding food or lovemaking, make sure to not leave them completely unprotected!</p><p>- Enemies will raid your nest and steal food if you leave it unprotected. The more enemies, the faster it gets drained.</p>\n\n<p>The game was made in a week for the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2, with the theme of \"Let There Be Chaos\". Unfortunately some last minute bugs butchered the final boss but congrats anyways if you made it that far :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T17:56:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/535525c93e6457038c11c2faab20cdd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Buburito Games", "ProKongroo"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
