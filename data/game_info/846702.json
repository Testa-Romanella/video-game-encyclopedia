Enter the simple yet vibrant world of a solenoid where our hero, a teeny tiny electron tries its best to make its way through the solenoid from one end to the other. Oh you thought that was all !!!! WELL SURPRISE !!!! There are other electrons (blue spheres) and protons (red spheres) in your way. And these guys are there to help you and destroy you at the same time. Collect the red spheres(protons) and your speed goes down. Collect the blue spheres(electrons) and the speed picks up. When your speed hits 0, YOU LOSE !!!So plan accordingly, strategically and let's see if you have it in you to make it all the way to the other end???? Well, what are you waiting for? <strong><em>WELCOME TO ELECTRUN</em></strong></p><p>Developers:</p><p>Adithya N Biya (20BCG10029) -\u00a0https://adithyabiya.itch.io/</p><p>Jewel Alexander Thomas (20BCG10075) -\u00a0https://jewel-a-thomas.itch.io/</p><p>Fiza Sameer (20BCG10067) -\u00a0https://bbqsauce67.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T09:44:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f74/f74dbed1cd7f80b0fbb221878a0cdd1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adithyabiya"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
