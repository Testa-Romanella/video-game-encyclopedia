The Dancer (Din) can jump small holes, the Swordsman (Link) has a sheild and can move heavy objects, the Singer (Naru) can talk to animals and not be attacked by monsters and the Princess (Zelda) can do and undo magic.</p>\n<p>While the spritework did start as rips from the GB games they have had to be edited to give all the characters all the basic movement sprites.</p>\n<p>===========<br/>Last Update:<br/>Camera moves in GB Zelda style<br/>===========<br/></p>\n<p>+++++++++++<br/>Next Update:<br/>Picking up and throwing objects<br/>+++++++++++</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efa/efa59bd0fed6969e7175dee1a6238c2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Overworld"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
