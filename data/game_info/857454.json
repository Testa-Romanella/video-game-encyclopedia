When their seclusive mentor mysteriously disappears, Frida and Vince\u00a0have to figure out how to perfect their skills on their own.\r\n</p>\n<p>Frida and Vince\u00a0decide to start their journey in the world-renowned\u00a0museum, where they take one\u00a0last\u00a0look at their mentor's works. From there, loaded with inspiration, they travel to the places where the original masterpieces were once created.\r\n</p>\n<p>Their journey takes them across Germany, to the famous Bastei rock formation and the Berlin Cathedral. Whether Frida and Vince are surrounded by nature or urban chaos, they focus on tracing their mentor's work step by step...\r\n</p>\n<p>Will you be able to achieve greatness?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To control Frida, use the <strong>cursor keys</strong> to walk around, and the <strong>P key</strong> to pick up or\u00a0interact with items.<br/>To control Vince, use the <strong>WASD keys</strong> to walk around, and the <strong>Q key</strong> to pick up or\u00a0interact with items.\r\n</p>\n<p>When you are carrying an item, you can press the interaction key (P or Q) to combine the items with something else, or to drop the item again.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, you will find various items, such as exhibits in the museum, buckets of paint, paint rollers, the canvas, and more. Both players can simultaneously walk around and interact with these items. Just move the character close to an item and press the interaction key, and the respective action will happen.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Your goal is to use this equipment to mix the correct colors and to create a great painting\u00a0on the canvas!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Remember that Frida and Vince will need to collaborate to finish a level in time!\r\n</p>\n<p>At the start of each level, you will briefly see the painting that Frida and Vince are supposed to replicate. The painting will then vanish from the canvas, and they have to create the painting from scratch, layer by layer. (You don\u2019t really need to remember the exact painting. Just follow the instructions that will pop up on the screen.)\r\n</p>\n<p>Take a look at the layers and their color combination instructions in the top left corner of the screen. Layers may require one or more colours. Start with the left-most layer. Then, work your way from left to right, one layer at a time.\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>If only one color is required for the layer, simply pick up a bucket of paint from the respective crate,</li><li>...and place it on one of the tables.</li><li>Pick up a paint roller and dip it into the bucket.</li><li>Then, use the loaded paint roller on the canvas.</li><li>Congratulations, you have just painted your first layer! On to the next one!\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>For the next layers, you will need to use more of the available equipment. Can you figure it out?\r\n</p>\n<p>Once you understand all the mechanics of painting, try beating the time and completing all layers with perfectly mixed colors!\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck, and have fun!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>TIPPS</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Before you can reuse a paint roller, you need to put it in the sink and clean it!\r\n</li><li>If two colors are needed for a layer, take the respective buckets to the mixer, let the mixer do its job, and then retrieve a bucket of the mixed color. But don\u2019t let the mixer run for too long, or otherwise it might break! (If it does break, you\u2019ll need to repair it!)\r\n</li><li>For some layers, you will have to combine even more than two colors. Work in multiple steps in these cases: Combine the first two colors and take the first resulting bucket from the mixer. Then, re-insert that bucket again and add the third color into the mixer, too. Continue this process as needed.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>LICENSES</strong></p>\n<p>https://trbl.io/games/artists/licenses</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T12:45:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/11903226ea654215b33c0b4616d69251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TRBL.IO"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
