Each time you press space, your character rotates through one of three movement abilities - dash, jump, and grapple, in that order. Time your spacebar presses perfectly to get through hell and its many deadly challenges, from exploding demons to pouncing succubi, and maybe meet the devil himself (in the DLC). Hold the spacebar until the circle is full to perform the most powerful version of your ability.\u00a0This game was made in Unity for the Game Maker's Toolkit 2019 jam by Leo Robles (Designer), Cam Howell (Artist), and Rachel Haub (Programmer).
