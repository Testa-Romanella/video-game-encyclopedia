The choices you make will shape the relationships you have with each of the women and will open different paths for Rockford's character development and the game's plot.<br/><br/><strong>STORY</strong><br/>Assistant District Attorney Rockford is an idealistic, well-respected prosecutor dedicated to the principles of the American criminal justice system. But while enjoying tremendous professional success, the thing he wants more than anything has always been just out of his reach--a family. His mother died when he was very young and he never met his father, an elite special forces soldier. And his romantic entanglements, though plentiful, have always ended with his partner frustrated by his paradoxical aversion to intimacy.<br/><br/>But Rockford's life is about to be upended: a cryptic clue in a cold-case murder will set him on a search to discover his father's fate. And learning the truth will push the prosecutor to question his dedication to the rule of law and to reconsider the meaning of family.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Rockford's search will bring him closer to four beautiful women: a tenacious homicide detective with whom Rockford has a romantic past; a brilliant prosecutorial colleague and childhood friend; a steely ex-military combat instructor with her own notions about the justice system; and a sweethearted schoolteacher whose past and future will link up with Rockford's to change both their lives forever.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T14:13:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3a73697582ed93e35269777e1c6dd2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 450, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The Impious Monk"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Impious Monk"], "esrb_rating": null}
