Change the color of every cube in the pyramid to proceed to the next level, whilst avoiding enemies and collecting power-ups. With an infinite number of levels, Alien Trouble will keep you entertained for hours! <br/> <br/>Alien Trouble was inspired by the original Q*bert 1982 game, which we all know and love. Since our kids can no longer experience the joy and excitement of playing Q*bert, as the once cutting edge graphics have now become \"retro\" and \"nostalgic\". That is why we redesigned the original game in the tone of the modern, flat and vibrant games(that and for obvious copyright reasons).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T12:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/997/997d2386470fa1af6ec50ab6ff6bdd97_KWm4acn.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Evgeni Petkov"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Evgeni Petkov"], "esrb_rating": null}
