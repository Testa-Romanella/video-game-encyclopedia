Most of the games had food delivery so we thought of combining the functionality and instead of using a person we changed it to a car. We also added some NPC's so that the user can enjoy hitting them and taking their crates but also avoid some as to not lose the food stacked in the trunk. Adding more obstacles also gave the game a bit of difficulty. Initially, we thought of creating a setting for a monkey to steal bananas and deliver them to the zoo, but with more discussion the game then refined to the state it is now.</p>\n<p><strong>Developers:</strong></p>\n<p>Khizar, Zain, Mehwish, Sufian.<br/></p>\n<p>Artist:</p>\n<p>Jesiel, Ammara</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T05:27:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e04/e0434fe4f06c3ed89e3982d35bf88466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["khizar93"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
