Chesscourt mission re-imagines the game around them, with treacherous dungeons filled with traps and confusion. Take the role of Pawn, a determined servant to the king hoping to escort the King out of his dungeon entrapment. Can you help her take on this sisyphean task?<br/></p>\n<p>Saves will be persistent if you play using the same browser or executable, so don't feel the need to do it all in one go.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Keyboard &amp; Mouse:<br/>Click to move and capture<br/>Z to undo<br/>R to reset<br/>M to return to menu</p>\n<p>Touch:<br/>Tap to move and capture<br/>Swipe left to undo<br/><em>Touch controls can cause issues when using a mouse, so they are off by default.
