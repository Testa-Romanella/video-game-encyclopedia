And a bunch of colorful robots have taken over (Presumably whoever designed RGB keyboards was put in charge of making all robots, UI and window borders in this dystopian hellhole), and your only hope for survival are your equally colorful and flashy lasers! Experience... Loud noises and flashing lights, make sure not to stare too hard or your eyes might melt. Also one enemy.

Based on Robotron 2084. I originally just made it because I had fun with Robotron and wanted to recreate the feeling of it, but 11 hours later (8 of which were spent just playing the game) I had to release it to make up for all the time I wasted.
