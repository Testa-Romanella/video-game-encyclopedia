However, you&#39;ll probably enjoy it more if you buy a Duck and a Pako!<br />\n~From 1/6 until 4/19, new players get free beginner-helpy items: &quot;Rice Ball&quot;, &quot;Gold Bar&quot;, and &quot;Diamond&quot;.~<br />\n\u25a0 Who is &quot;Yamada-kun&quot;?<br />\nYamada-kun is a salaryman who, every night, develops a videogame alone in his apartment. In his videogame, he is a brave, successful hero experiencing trials and thrills within various retro-pixel-arty, chiptuney dungeons. He is the star of his own game. Also, he is the star of our game, (which you should download), which depicts his life, and also contains the entirety of his game.<br />\n\u25a0Story<br />\nYamada-kun (Age 36) is a salaryman working as a programmer at a major game publisher.<br />\nHis job sucks.<br />\nDeep into every night, alone in his apartment, he works on his own game.<br />\nOne day, the Chairman fires Yamada-kun!<br />\nUnemployment strengthens Yamada-kun&#39;s game-making resolve: the Evil Chairman will be the final boss!<br />\nHe falls in love with Maria-chan next door -- he might as well put her in the game, too! It probably won&#39;t even be creepy or weird at all! She can be the princess, and he can rescue her. It&#39;ll be such a simple game -- a tale of pure love.<br />\nYamada-kun is excited to make his game.<br />\nWe are excited for you to play our game, which is about Yamada-kun making his game. Please play our game, within which you will also (make and) play Yamada-kun&#39;s game.<br />\n\u25a0How to play<br />\nTo clear a floor of a dungeon, use your finger to draw a path between the entrance and the exit.<br />\nAlong the path, the Hero (that&#39;s Yamada-kun (that&#39;s us (that&#39;s you))) will encounter monsters, treasures, traps, and obstacles. The path you choose determines what you encounter, and when.<br />\nThe Hero moves along the path, battling in real-time. Use whatever items you&#39;ve brought in your Item Bag to heal, attack, defend, and keep the Hero alive.<br />\nClear floors with a path covering all squares of the 5-by-5 grid for a bonus!<br />\nClear entire dungeons for big rewards!<br />\nGet stuff! Get tough! Help Yamada-kun make a videogame in which he rescues a princess who looks exactly like the girl who lives next door to him, except in the game her hair is blonde instead of brown (&quot;Original Character&quot;)!<br />\n\u25a0Use your head: use items<br />\nYou need to carefully consider when and how you use items.<br />\nSome items attack faraway enemies; some items attack all enemies.<br />\nSome enemies have special skills and / or movements.<br />\nRespect your items. Your items love you. Understand when, where, and how to use them.<br />\nIt feels good to plan ahead.<br />\n\u25a0Upgrade your weapons!<br />\nLet&#39;s be honest: you can&#39;t have an adventure without sometimes accidentally acquiring treasure, items, armor, and weapons. They&#39;re lying around all over the place!<br />\nComplete a dungeon to keep the treasure you earned.<br />\nUse treasure to upgrade your weapons and armor little by little. It&#39;s like cooking, except your weapons and armor do the eating.<br />\nPower up equipment to be stronger when you enter a dungeon again. (You start at level 1 every time you enter a dungeon. Yamada-kun is 36 years old: that&#39;s the sort of game he likes.)<br />\nEquip matching items to uncover a wide variety of fine, dandy, and sometimes idiotic equipment sets.<br />\nHow high can you power up a piece of equipment? What materials work best with what equipment? We&#39;re not going to lie to you: the answers are &quot;real high, sometimes&quot; and &quot;uhhh there&#39;s a lot of materials and you can play this game in the bathroom, so please experiment with whatever&quot;.<br />\n\u25a0Who will love &quot;Dandy Dungeon&quot;?<br />\n\u30fbEveryone<br />\n\u30fbEveryone<br />\n\u30fbEveryone<br />\n\u30fbEveryone<br />\n\u25a0Who will love &quot;Dandy Dungeon&quot; <em>a lot</em>?<br />\n\u30fbPeople who like to lol<br />\n\u30fbPeople who think it&#39;s funny that someone made an RPG about an avuncular unmarried unemployed man who lives alone making an RPG by himself<br />\n\u30fbRPG fans<br />\n\u30fbAnime<br />\n\u30fbDungeon crawler fans<br />\n\u30fbPuzzle fans<br />\n\u30fbPixel art fans</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be52bb2a2b063c29490811a17fdca21a.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["DMM.com Co"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["DMM.com Co"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
