{"id": 561880, "slug": "covalence-financialmadness", "name": "Covalence (FinancialMadness)", "name_original": "Covalence (FinancialMadness)", "description": "<p>Covalence is a game about combining with your fellow hydrogen molecules to defeat as many anti-hydrogen matter enemies as possible. The bigger you are, the more health you have, the harder you hit and the more points you rack up when killing other enemies! Make sure you are fully combined by the end of the time or you lose and your score goes to zero.</p>\n<p>The core game mechanic is that you are moving around to \"collect\" more hydrogen atoms. If you take too much damage, you split apart into the last most stable formation (i.e. 5 hydrogen atoms -&gt; 4 hydrogen atoms) and you MUST bond back with the hydrogen atoms you lost before time is up. You get the benefit of being a more stable molecule when you are bonded with more hydrogen molecules and you get more points when you kill enemies!</p>\n<p>However, the longer the game goes on and the stronger you get, the more enemies that appear. Stick together, blast some baddies, and sit back and enjoy some bumping tunes in our debut title, Covalence!</p>\n<p>Remember, you are STRONGER TOGETHER!</p>\n<p>This was our first ever start to finish project, so please be patient if there are any bugs and try reloading the game if anything seems super off.</p><p>Built by FinancialMadness (Andy Guidas) with music by Justin Mayo for the Brackeys Game Jame 2021.1.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4f8df9f8345af0eb92aaa0ad6a32a3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FinancialMadness"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
