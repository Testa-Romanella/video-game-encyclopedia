You have acted in a blockbuster: Multi Wars III, but after that, your career just started to drop down. You only have one person in your life: a virtual girl called <strong>Asami</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>She helps you everytime you need it, but you know you are only having a bad time and you will leave her eventually. When the producer of the series \u00abBlue Love\u00bb calls you, you are skeptical about the role. In the audition he tells you: \u00abyou are the chosen one\u00bb; you also recognize Sakiko in the studios, an actress you met before in the sets of Multi Wars III. You fell easily in love with <strong>Sakiko</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Asami, in the other hand is acting weird: she says she loves you, she repeats again and again that she wants to be with you.\u00a0<strong>Then she appears in one dream, where she tells you that someone is helping her to be real</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>Music by: Chad Crouch &amp; Blue Dot Sessions<br/></p>\n<p>All other credits: Kumanger's Team</p>\n\n<p>For Windows:\u00a0unzip the downloadable file and execute the .exe file.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Mac: we hope someone plays it in Mac to help us about the instructions (leave a comment below).</p>\n<p>*We are not native english speakers.
