My initial plan was to have some kind of narrative build into the game, but due to time constraints I wasn't able to add it.<br/>So here is the \"background-story\":<br/>You play as a mercenary and got hired to \"clean\" a research station. In this station, gene experiments were carried out on various creatures. Obviously something went wrong and you are now supposed to get rid of any evidence.<br/><br/>As mentioned above time was a limiting factor for me. I started on Monday the 6th and ended on Sunday the 12th. I did submit like 2 minutes before midnight. Sadly my Web-build wasn't working by then. So I uploaded a working version 10 minutes after midnight, which means technically this wasn't in the deadline. It's completely the same though.<br/><br/>If you run into any performance issues I advise you to reduce the view distance and try the desktop build.\u00a0<br/>HAVE FUN :)</p>\n<p>Controls: <br/>W/A/S/D - Move<br/>Mouse 1 - Shoot<br/>Mouse Wheel - Switch Weapon<br/>ESC - Pause<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T05:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/116/116c99473200138b4839a3a66227cfba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DonPasquale"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
