Probably the biggest game that I've managed to \"complete\" for a game jam to date! I haven't had time to finish the level art within the allowed time but I might release a second version with complete art and a couple of tweaks.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I'm pretty happy and would love for you to play it!</p>\n<p>---\u00a0CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Left Click - select / attack</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>A or Left Arrow - move left</p>\n<p>D or Right Arrow - move right</p>\n\n<p>That's about it!
