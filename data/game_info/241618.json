After enabling the expansion, you can continue to play The Quest Classic with your existing character(s) to explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>You're called to the northern port of Seversk in deep winter to join the Tzar, his militia and navy for a final assault on the fortress of Kozney the Deathless.  Kozney has new allies, elves and dwarf blacksmiths, as well as the spirits of his mighty, cunning dragons to back him up. Enjoy one of Argimon's trickiest dungeons yet and learn Silvergirl's deathless secret. New monsters, new spells, roughly 60 quests will take you throughout a beautiful land, including a mysterious island, to the ocean floor and to the Underworld.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"The Deathless\" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 45 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.<br/><br/>The Quest Classic - Hero of Lukomorye IV has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:11:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02b/02b2ad7f3f0b40d9468eb7d68502522f.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
