Be careful, this place is cursed... with an insect infection.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD / Arrow Keys for movement, Spacebar to pick up objects and put them away (and also to restart the game upon losing/winning), and Shift to run. (Be careful, running makes you hold whatever you drop!). Probably also works with controller but the project wasn't designed with them in mind so I can't do much to help you with that.<br/></p>\n<p>Bestiary:<br/></p>\n<p>Spider: Nasty fellow, will chase you down if you get near it for too long. With how bold it is, you'd think it came from Australia. It's actually native to here, though apparently it *is* an invasive species down under.</p>\n<p>Wasp: Not actually an insect, but rather an evil spirit taking a fearsome form. No wonder it's as big as you are... Also explains why it's slow and able to travel through walls. Oh, and how it can see you from across the map!<br/></p>\n<p>Werewolf: ok listen this is a gamejam game and I figured the pun was better than \"Warehouse Collectathon\" or whatever else I could come up with in 5 minutes. Maybe in a future update I'll add a werewolf. Or maybe a weredragon. Or a better title.<br/></p>\n<p>~~~<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the 2022 Secret Santa Jam<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T11:39:22", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Crisptian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
