Collect potions of the same colour as the skull. Don't hit the potions or skull of the other colour. Keep collecting potions or else it'll get a lot harder to see what you're doing. You might also feel sick.</p><p>WARNING: flashing colours and excessive screenshake. </p><p><strong>1.1 Update: </strong>high scores now save. Visual feedback when collect potions. Other minor changes.<br/></p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point.
