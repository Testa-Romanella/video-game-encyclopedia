Shoot enthusiastically, and your poem will be passionate; play evasively, and your poem will be coy.  Die immediately, and your poem will be small, doomed and wistful.  Just like Shelley.  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f29/f2974cd4dc7e72d0dac4c3d3adc373e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ratsalley"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
