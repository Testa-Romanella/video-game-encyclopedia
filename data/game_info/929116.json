His quest to become the world champion of staring contests has come a long way, and he is lossless up until this point. However, Si's final foe does not play nice. Avoid all of the attacks until the opponent blinks to win!\u00a0 Face the danger and avoid all the attacks! If you get hit, you will die instantly, because Si is mostly just eye.</p>\n\n<p>this is really just a quick game where I have been itching to try and make a boss fight, so I did. I also overscoped a ton, and didn't have the time to make an environment. I would make a boss rush game, but this is not the one. Animation for Si was so fun to make though.</p>\n\n<p>Ohh damn</p>\n<p>I just did the first html test and it was hilarious how the music switches in tone so drastically. Also, I promise you the game is beatable.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>All sound is from freesounds.org</p><p>All art and code from me, made with the Pixilart app and Unity Engine and VScode</p>\r\nPlease leave feedback and rate.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T07:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e478b759f0b5e52667ed7708bb6b555d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Knight-fall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
