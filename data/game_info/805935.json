This game is basically just a test for future games I will make to see how things work. You have to dodge these red spike creatures forever until you die. You have a score, and a highscore meter. I may add a shop later that you can buy stuff with your highscore.</p>\n<p>I will try to get this game on different platforms like getting it to run on this website\u00a0to test how that works too.</p>\n<p>--------------- MUSIC--------------</p>\n<p>Ingame Music: Cut and Run by Kevin Macleod</p>\n<p>Lobby Music: Kool Kats by Kevin Macleod</p>\n\n<p>------CHANGELOG-------</p>\n<p>Version 1.1: android support lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T19:15:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/836/836beef776e45c0db753f1a4024dbd2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["minecart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
