This game, A Hole Reality, was made in about one week for the Beginner's Circle Jam #3 with the theme of \"A Different Planet\". Unfortunately, I made a mistake with the deadline, so this game was not submitted to the jam.</p>\n<p>However - YOU can still play it and (hopefully) have fun!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>A and D to move</li><li>W to jump</li><li>Left mouse button or SPACE bar to shoot</li><li>W twice in rapid succession to double jump</li></ul>\n<p>As I did not have time to integrate the storyline into the actual game, I might as well say it here. You are an explorer, trying to stop the inhabitants of this solar system from corrupting reality. They have shrunk many planets, causing holes in reality where there was once matter. Your job, is to collect all planets, kill all enemies and escape. The planets (an infinite power source - they are not damaged) power up your suit, so you need to collect them. If you are hit by an enemy, one of the planets will be lost. If all planets are lost, reality becomes too unstable. The fate of the universe is in your hands. Good luck...</p>\n<p>Have a good one!</p>\n<p>TheSquiggler</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bef/bef4d9176571a446887259d1713e2f4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheSquiggler"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
