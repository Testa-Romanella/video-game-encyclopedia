HYDROLOCUST is a virus I made in python about a month ago. It was one of my first projects. What This does: HYDROLOCUST is a harmless virus, it doesn't delete files, or do anything dangerous. It only opens a lot of tabs and windows, so many in fact it takes a few hours to move them out of the way. It also opens alert messages and sounds. HOW TO DEACTIVATE: There are two ways to stop HYDROLOCUST. 1. Press \"command Tab\" until you get to your python running system. 2. Or you can just restart your PC.</p>\n\n<p>Hydrolocust does\u00a0not do any long term damage, it can easily be removed and is supposed to be a joke virus.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T15:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15a/15aa8e2b49496dd56c0c8d10901a61de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zonellobster250"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
