The theme was 'Deeper and deeper', so in this game you play as a diver, in search for a lost artifact within the bowels of the <strong>Temple of the Sea Floor</strong>.</p>\n<p>I wrote 10 levels up in Puzzlescript. There are some things I am more proud of, and some things that I am less proud of - I may take another look at this some time and refine it: specifically, improve some of the levels, give it more polish, and give another go at some of the pixel art.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Other notes:</p>\n<p>I used the following pallete for all my art:\u00a0https://lospec.com/palette-list/seafoam\r\n</p>\n<p>I also used the level select fork of Puzzlescript here:\u00a0https://pancelor.com/PuzzleScript/editor.html\r\n</p>\n<p>I recommend Puzzlescript to anyone interested in making 2d turn-based puzzle games. It's very intuitive, surprisingly powerful, and has some decent documentation and source code to read through if you do some looking online.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T07:24:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b67/b67526aafe38be8bf5b71ed5508e1aff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oeschmid"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
