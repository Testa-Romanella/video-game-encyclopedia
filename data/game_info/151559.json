He knows no fear. He knows no remorse. Actually, he doesn't know much in general. </p><p>In Defense of Karmax-3 episode, Captain Rogers needs to defend a secret space base against an treacherous Kershan attack. The Kershans attacked when Captain Rogers had his guard down (doesn't happen too often, but this time Rogers ate some far-too-hot tacos) and now the Kershans rockets are everywhere. Tap anywhere on the screen for Captain Rogers to aim and fire his huge space gun at that point. (note the gun need to rotate at it takes some time). If you would be luck you might survive all the 300 rockets that Kershan just shoot at the base.</p><p> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000c54c09e84af69662a29fbe9a85a54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["blackmoondev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
