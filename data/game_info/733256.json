{"id": 733256, "slug": "date-simulator", "name": "Date Simulator", "name_original": "Date Simulator", "description": "<p>Arthur Edison is, by all counts, a loser. However, he is a loser that managed to land a date. He\u2019s been so nervous about it that his friends have gotten concerned, so they decide to try to both cheer him up and prepare him for his impending romantic encounter simultaneously - by going on pretend dates with him! Problem is, they\u2019re all losers too, so the chance of such a plan being effective is questionable at best. Join Arthur and friends as they do their best to give each other advice on a topic they know absolutely nothing about!\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is another one on the shorter side, probably taking under an hour to 100%, so if that\u2019s your preference then perhaps you\u2019ll enjoy it! It\u2019s also mostly writing and low on mechanics, so take that into consideration before giving it a try. Either way, I hope you enjoy it! And as always, thank you for playing! <br/></p>\n\n<p>Sound effects provided by FreeSound.org and created with ChipTone.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T05:46:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e019a0590cf9e53a9dcf5bd6846f4dc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
