Once your crystal line is full, you need to find a barrel to dump them in (just stand next to it) and repeat three times for each level.</p><p>BUT, there are robots (they look like cute dogs!) that will try to stop you.</p><p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T10:25:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de0/de088b4caf3c7398362b4bf02207f81f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sampyxis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
