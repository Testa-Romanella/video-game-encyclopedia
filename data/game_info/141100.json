Space Trucking in 8 bit style, with procedurally generated levels. <br/>What you see above is a demo of Tiny Cosmos' Long Haul mode, where you attempt to get as far as you can on a single never-ending stage. Each time you reach the truck stop, the next one will be a bit farther.<br/></p>\n<p>Created for the Minimalist Game Jam 3 by Cliff Coffee. All art, design, programming, music and other assets created week of the jam. It is my first actual game release and my first game jam! 2-3 colors per sprite 10 colors for the whole game. Built with Aseprite, Jeskola Buzz, and Unity.</p>\n<p>Note: The windows version is updated with bug fixes and includes ship upgrades, reduced cargo damage. <br/></p>\r\nNOTE: Press SHIFT if using Keyboard or A Button on joystick to \"PRESS START\"\r\n<p>\u00a0<br/>Tiny Cosmos is a simple and fast paced trucking / hauling game in space where just about everything is out to get you. You are not armed with missiles and guns like one would expect from a side-scrolling space game, instead you must evade and escape enemies and make it through without damaging your cargo too much. Your cargo itself holds weight and sways as you maneuver, as it is entirely physics driven. <br/></p>\n<p>Using your shield or boosting uses Power, which regenerates over time. In the current game demo build you can have 2 maximum power (+1 full regen gauge) and 4 maximum health.</p>\r\nGame Modes\r\nHere is a glimpse at the game modes planned and in development for Tiny Cosmos\r\n<ul><li><strong>Career Mode -\u00a0</strong>Make your mark in the galaxy as the most reliable Space Logistics company! Choose your ship, buy and sell cargo to space ports, undertake missions and contracts, upgrade your ship, and establish new routes.</li><li><strong>Time Trials</strong> - Compete with other haulers for the fastest times through some of the galaxy's most noteworthy and dangerous stages. These stages are not procedurally generated and ships are preset to create a level playing field for players to compete against one another for placement on the leaderboards.</li><li><strong>Long Haul (Survival)</strong> - This is the game mode demo'ed on this page. Get as far as you can with just basic upgrades and refueling in a stage filled with hacked military space station turrets, aliens, and asteroids. How far can you get, and how fast can you get there? </li></ul>\r\nNew Features in Development\r\n\r\nNavigation Maps\r\n<p>Traveling between different systems, you'll get to choose the route you take. Each destination has its own features that effect what you encounter along the way. These are indicated on the map by the icons floating above the map nodes. If you backtrack through a route, you'll basically be running the stage in reverse, with some variations.  <br/></p>\r\nScreenshots\r\n\n\n<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cc/7cc61828f8d4e952fbf0538629e9d318.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Skull Wizard Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
