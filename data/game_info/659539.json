The theme was Rotation and we were supposed to only use the assets provided by https://kenney.nl/<br/>The page for the project was made in a rush so I'll take some time to improve it, take some screenshots and polish the game in the next few days.**</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Rotate the Island to how it was in the beginning. Don't worry about the exact tiles but more about their type. It basically goes from Castle &gt; Buildings &gt; Grass and Trees &gt; Beach &gt; Water (Although you can't change the water tiles)</p>\n<p>Click on a tile and use the arrow keys or \"A\" and \"D\" to rotate the neighbouring tiles. Rotate the camera also with the same keys but when you don't have a tile selected.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64a/64ac38f1c4b5ef272a77ed28c47b7628.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Andre Castel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
