Don't worry though because for Ludum Dare 31 all you have to do is get rid of some lowly slime, but it could get rough. Use the arrow keys to move and the space bar to advance battle text. Battle with an enemy begins when they are adjacent to you. Music can be muted with the M key. Have fun!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Everything in this game was made by me, however the only thing not done within the 72 hours of LD31 was the music which I did in FamiTracker about a year ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Please give feedback! This is my 1st submitted Ludum Dare game and I really wanna know how I did.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42c/42cbf823114ed3a317d15779ebc916a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Asix Jin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
