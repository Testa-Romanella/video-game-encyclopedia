Thousands of people addicted to Ring Toss 3D - Strategy Game Arcade Fun Simulation can't be wrong! <br/><br/>Enjoy the same classic gaming experience on your device now!<br/><br/>Ring Toss 3D is a game of skill and grace patterned on the ring-toss games that have long been popular at county fairs, carnivals, and arcades. <br/><br/>You toss a metallic ring toward set of standing targets across the room or a few feet away, winning points every time that you land the ring around one of the targets (typically bottles, cans, or some other kind of cylinders). Ring Toss recreates the look and feel of this game for your device.<br/><br/>Animated by the best available game physics, the ring hefts, flies, and falls like a spinning metal ring would: arcing, circling, sliding, sloping, bouncing off of the side wall. Touch, aim, and slide the ring to throw it. Your perspective rushes forward just a step behind the ring, as if you were lunging forward, adding a sense of three-dimensional depth.<br/><br/>Play is timed, in rounds. Whenever you successfully land the ring around a bottle, that target disappears from the table. Clear the table grid of as many targets as possible during a round to maximize your score. Ring Toss 3D tracks your progress, always retaining your highest score. As you play, you develop a feel for the way that the ring moves. With concentration, you can become expert at tossing it on top of a target, and can start to work strategically toward clearing the table.<br/><br/>The app is extensively customizable: Choose from different play environments: the Private Party Hall for when you feel like hobnobbing with the Park Avenue Set, the Rustic Metallic Shed for when you're feeling grungy, the Slippery Mosaic Pool Room when you're in an artistic mood, etc. Set the target grid matrix (i.e., the array of bottles or cylinders) according to your comfort level: 4x4, 5x4, or 6x4. Select shorter- or longer-angle views of the game room. Customize or silence the game's sound effects and music themes dynamically during play: cheers, clapping, arcade music, pop tunes, etc.<br/><br/>Please visit us at www.sulaba.com for following interesting gaming titles and other mindful apps for all ages!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T12:15:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/429/4294b4380af4f2fa01c92c7bde3ac9c9.jpg", "website": "http://www.sulaba.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sulaba"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["sulaba"], "esrb_rating": null}
