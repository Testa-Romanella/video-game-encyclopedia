A software protocol, centuries old, has been re-activated and an artificial being, Lectrovolt, has been created. Explore and navigate the ruins of Erlis, from the military Core below the basement to the lofty Penthouse, solve intricate puzzles, upgrade Lectrovolt and charge larger and larger machinery to bring it to life, and fulfil your programming. <br/><br/>Accompanied with a relaxing, deep soundtrack by Ketsa, a subversive secret lore and challenging achievements, 'Lectrovolt II' is the first ambitious Steam release by Harmonize Studios.======== UPDATE 1.2.9 - CHARACTER CHANGE PATCH ========<br/>In preparation for the FREE Outpost DLC, set to be released next year, Lectrovolt II has been updated with the new ability to change your Lectrovolt unit's colour!
