{"id": 718559, "slug": "spider-man-miles-morales-for-windows", "name": "Spider Man: Miles Morales: For Windows", "name_original": "Spider Man: Miles Morales: For Windows", "description": "<p>Plot</p>\n<p>The narrative continues the plot of Spider-Man 2018 and the DLC \"The City that Never Sleeps\", where Miles Morales was bitten by a mutated spider. Now he has the same superpowers as Peter Parker. Miles wears his traditional black and red suit and fights criminals like Spider-Man. He cannot save the city, as he is on \"vacation\" with Mary Jane Watson in the country of Simkaria. Parker tells Miles that he must be like his father, a policeman who died in a terrorist attack, in order to become a hero of New York.</p>\n<p>Shortly before the beginning of the game's plot, Miles' family moves to Harlem, an area that is under threat: Roxxon Energy Corporation is going to solve power outages by building a dangerous reactor powered by a fictional nuform substance. Meanwhile, a war begins in the city between Spider-Man and the high-tech criminal group Underground, led by a Craftsman [en][4][5][6], under the mask of which Fina, a school friend of Morales, is hiding. Miles's uncle also turns out to be an anti-hero Tramp, who at the same time helps his nephew.</p>\n<p>Gameplay</p>\n<p>The main gameplay of Spider-Man: Miles Morales is similar to that of the previous game. The player moves through an open world, which is a snow-covered fictional version of modern Manhattan, as the game takes place in winter.</p>\n<p>Miles Morales, like Peter Parker, can use the web to attack enemies, crawl and run on walls. At key points in the storyline, he gets the ability to disable his enemies with electricity, camouflage (temporary invisibility) and an improved version of the attack that beats opponents with electricity, allowing him to defeat several targets at once. Other abilities can be unlocked through the skill tree. Miles also has access to his own unique gadgets: remote mines that can attach to enemies, or electric panels, a device that can summon holographic fighters to help him in battle, and gravity wells that can catch multiple enemies and make it easier to hit them. The character's abilities can be improved as the player's level increases.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T05:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84a/84ab5746c8a49ba1b2b226df023d27b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 584, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Game"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
