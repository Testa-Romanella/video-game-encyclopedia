The NES version was released in 1991, followed by the Genesis version in 1993. A Super NES version was advertised in magazines, but never released.</p>\n<p>Action 52 consists of 52 \"New and Original\" games that cover a variety of genres, with the most common being scrolling shooters and platformers. One of the more notable games is The Cheetahmen, Active's attempt at creating a franchise similar to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p>\n<p>The NES version of Action 52 became notorious among gamers for the poor quality and functionality of its games, and is often considered to be one of the worst games of all time. The Genesis version is widely considered superior, though still of subpar quality. Many video game collectors value Action 52 for its notoriety and rarity, as it initially retailed for the comparatively high price of US$199, or \"less than $4 for each game\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-17T01:32:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a15/a15ead9c06213fbf31302ab759840b43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["NES", "Genesis"], "developers": ["FarSight Studios", "Active Enterprises", "FarSight Technologies"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Active Enterprises"], "esrb_rating": null}
