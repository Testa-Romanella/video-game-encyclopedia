Find Johnny Indigo by inspecting items and talking to characters. If you get stuck, try asking characters for hints. This is the first game we've ever made, and all the content in the game was created by us (with the exception of some open source fonts). We hope you enjoy playing it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed3cdf3192499a82139067a19b23183c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["legendarysandbird"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
