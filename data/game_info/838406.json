However you're on a constant timer (and drawing good looking doodles gives you extra time) so you need to be both fast and precise! :)</p>\n<p>The game gets harder over time by giving you less and less extra seconds, in the late stage it really challenges your muscle memory and drawing speed.<br/></p>\n<p>TIP: Try to draw everything as simple as you can, the AI doesn\u00b4t really like too many details, intersecting or squiggly lines, if you struggle try changing up your style of drawing.<br/></p>\n<p>------------<br/><br/>Made possible thanks to the ml5.js machine learning framework and DoodleNet doodle recognition model , I also use p5.js for the canvas.</p>\n<p>Sound effects obtained from https://www.zapsplat.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T21:05:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d63/d638f3190d25823620a8ac2998533135.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kohel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
