The theme for the jam was 'Ritual', and we created our game, an asymmetric 2D multiplayer game, in response. The game features a shepherd and a sheep, and each has their own goal; the shepherd needs to get the sheep to the sacrificial altar on the top of the mountain to the left, and the sheep needs to escape to the far right of the screen. It also features an acapella soundtrack, as one of the diversifiers for the Global Game Jam that year involved using only voices to make the music and sounds for your game.
