Currently it's movement puzzles but there are plans for using shadows and light to activate switches, to move objects to useful positions and possible to throw hazards out of your path.</p><p>As it stands this is a prototype piece built in GameMaker for Windows, but I aim to do a kickstarter in the next month or so to get a professional 2D artist and a musician involved and convert it into Unity so I can spread it out to as many platforms as I can manage. So please play and spread the word and pledge once the kickstarter kicks off.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Adam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2da/2dab07806aa3828be6f87fc5d69523b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Salubrious Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
