You can move around in the world, select a zone and\u00a0edit it. Anyone can see the things you build. So it is kind of like a multiplayer game.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>I know it is not perfect at the moment, I would say this is still in early Alpha stage.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Please don't forget that you can only edit within your currently selected zone.<br/>You can't edit any other voxels in the neighboring zones. So Select the zone you want to edit, then click edit zone. After you finished you can click on the leave zone and enter into any other zones in the world.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I hope you will some have fun, and please share your opinion about the project.<br/></p>\n<p>Follow my work on:<br/>\ud83d\udc49Twitter<br/>\ud83d\udc49Discord<br/>\ud83d\udc49Facebook</p>\n<p>You can play the game on it's own site: VoxelAtlas.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T19:20:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1f3d757e26aafd61cedb96d1f967b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NanoidGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
