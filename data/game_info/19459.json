This franchise has intricate lore and the setting that gathered a fanbase and formed a strong following. But not everyone can be a commander overseeing the combat from afar. Someone has to follow the orders. This is the case with X-COM: Enforcer, third-person shooter. Players take direct control over a combat robot, named the Enforcer. The game is set in the First Alien War, where the united governments are closing down the project of creating the ultimate warrior. But due to the lack of funds, the project was finished by the leader of the research, Professor Able Standard, and the result was unleashed on the invading forces.<br />\nX-COM: Enforcer borrows the research mechanic, where players collect data points by killing enemies. Research upgrades between missions, and if any \u201cUnresearched objects\u201d was collected during the missions, the research branches will be extended. The game is focused on the continual action sections, but sometimes the player might encounter puzzles, obstructing the story progress.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2001-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-14T04:51:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d937fb411129d54c152a7454d372ec79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.27, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 92, "owned": 1607, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 16, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 73, "suggestions_count": 411, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 73, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicroProse Software", "Hasbro Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["2K Games", "Infogrames"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
