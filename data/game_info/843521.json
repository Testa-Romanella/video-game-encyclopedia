A socially awkward person that gets extreme anxiety when around people for too long. You wake up on a floor at an unknown location. When you look around you to assess the situation, you realise where you are. A house party - your worst nightmare!</p>\n<p>Race through maze-like levels that seem never ending and escape before it's too late! Burst through endless amounts of doors in search for the glorious shiny exit. You'll have to strategise in order to find it and memorising the floorplan of the house is key to finding the exit and escaping! Can you escape the party before it's too late?</p>\n<p>* The game is very poorly optimised as I am very bad at optimisation. If you're getting very low FPS, I suggest setting the Graphics Quality to Medium or Low. It is only available for Windows. I tried adding support for Mac and WebGL, but sadly Unity broke and I couldn't export versions for them.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2 with the theme being You're not alone. This is my first time participating in a Jam and I hope you enjoy my short little game that I made over the course of 1 week.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T13:08:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82c/82c5e6ebb5df3a5fe1ffc67b97a936c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChorcheKork"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
