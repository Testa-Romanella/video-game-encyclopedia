{"id": 277936, "slug": "where-the-bees-make-honey", "name": "Where the Bees Make Honey", "name_original": "Where the Bees Make Honey", "description": "Where the Bees Make Honey tells a story about reflecting on different moments from your childhood, which are played and experienced from an adult perspective. <br/><br/>It's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. <br/><br/>At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout. When game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life.<br/><br/>Playable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-19T19:18:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ba/6baef0483c7dc217c7da2e8c51bddf52.jpg", "website": "https://whitethorndigital.com/wtbmh/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 23, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 63, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Whitethorn Digital", "Wakefield Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Whitethorn Digital"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
