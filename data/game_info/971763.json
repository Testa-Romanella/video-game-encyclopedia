Following the total failure of one of the experiments, a lockdown order was called, dropping a heavily reinforced seal and several tons of rubble down on the entrance in order to keep whatever went wrong contained indefinitely. It was presumed there were no survivors. This is technically not the case.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are Frank Sorenson, seemingly the only survivor of whatever catastrophe befell Blacksite Theta. Previously a test subject, you now have no reason to stay here and nobody to make you stay, allowing you to wander free in hopes of finding a route out of the newly created ruin. While you wouldn't wish the procedures you underwent on your worst enemies, they do offer you some rather... occult... benefits.<br/>\r\nAccording to the dusty ritual texts used to experiment upon you, you have become a Conduit, or one who can communicate with a being from the Plane of Force. His advice and the power he grants you shall be the one lifeline you have in your desperate struggle to escape.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn order to overcome increasingly complex puzzles deep within the facility, players will need to employ their recently acquired mutant arm capabilities, including pushing, destroying, pulling, grappling, and dashing. As they delve further into the challenges, players must also evade the perilous traps set by the facility, as failure would lead to their assimilation into the enigmatic Blacksite Theta. The ultimate objective is to secure your escape from this dire predicament at all costs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-07T07:53:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e49b5acf9624c22a440a6ddc4bc4b99.jpg", "website": "http://blacksitetheta.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UWW MAGD"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["UWW MAGD"], "esrb_rating": null}
