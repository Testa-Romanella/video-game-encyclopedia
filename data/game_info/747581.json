That is all.</p>\n<p>I uploaded this right at the buzzer for deadline so I would expect there's a few bugs. Please let me know in the comments if you find one!</p>\n<p>I also don't know if the balance is right as I'm the only one who has played it so far. You have 10 minutes to solve the labyrinth, I don't know if that's a decent amount of time or not.</p>\n<p>I didn't get time for music or sound effects. Or many of the other features I had planned. I hope to keep working on this after the jam deadline and get it to a more complete state.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73d/73d220be98bdc59a9ef94cb2581ad007.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Triangletriangle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
