{"id": 704533, "slug": "project3-cbl9", "name": "Project3 (cbl9)", "name_original": "Project3 (cbl9)", "description": "<p>My app is a paint app that allows the user to display objects on the screen. Choices for the objects include, the sun, the moon, clouds, and airplanes. The user can change the color of the object with the red, blue, and green sliders. There is a toggle called \u201cTimed Destroy\u201d that will destroy the objects on the screen in the order that they were painted in to prevent the screen from getting too crowded. If the user would like, they can turn this off. Similarly, there is a button on called \u201cClear\u201d that will destroy all the objects that the user had spawned and the user can start over. There is a clock that displays what the time is currently. The \u201cTime Destroy\u201d slider will allow the user to change the amount of time that they have before the objects disappear. The default for this is 10 seconds. There are also features that allow the user to change the object. The object\u2019s size, glow, and opacity can change using the slider.   New features that I had added to implement animation are the AM or PM button, and I had added new objects that are animated in the Dropdown UI. The AM / PM button implements animation as the light rotates as the time passes. The three new objects use animations: the Sun Prefab with Rotation animation, the Cloud Prefab using the Scale animation, and the Airplane Prefab using the Position animation.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T14:21:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e68551dd23ff9ba3bbc24806c88d961b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cbl9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
