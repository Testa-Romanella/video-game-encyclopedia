You play a lone firefighter trying to stop a blaze from overtaking a factory. The only issue is there are furnaces constantly catching ablaze, and without you they'll that the whole building down! How long can you survive the blazing inferno?</p>\n<p>The hearts are your health, the blue bar is the facility health/integrity. Taking a hit costs health, while the lit furnaces degrade the facility over time. Facility integrity refills after every level, your health does not.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys - movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - point to aim, click to shoot</p>\n<p>M - mute music</p>\n<p>N - must sound effects</p>\n<p>Esc - pause<br/><br/></p>\n<p>WARNING: I've had some flakiness with this game and Firefox. I don't have too much experience with WebGL, so I might be taxing it in weird ways. Restarts might be able to help if the game is struggling to load at first.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acb/acbc29e6648dec9bc5aa77d0db204d94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ternarydesigns"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
