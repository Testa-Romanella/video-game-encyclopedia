The game is limited, but still completable.\u00a0<br/>In this early access version, only the Spell Caster options are available. Melee and ranged combat options and weapons are unavailable for the time being. They will be added later.<br/>Likewise, you may find interactable loot boxes, which doesn\u2019t have anything inside. I am working on an \u201cauto generate loot system\u201d, which will be implanted at some point.<br/>Bugs and grammar mistakes are unavoidable as well.
