The first instalment in the Puzzle &amp; Action trilogy, it is a spin-off of Bonanza Bros. The characters from Bonanza Bros are featured as protagonists, functioning as detectives. A prison escapee is chased, and his henchmen interfere. A series of timed mini games must be completed to defeat the henchmen. The game features references to western culture.</p>\n<p>The game was ported the Sega Mega Drive and Game Gear in 1994, to the Saturn as part of the Sega Ages Shukudai ga Tant R compilation in 1996, and released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. An updated version was released for the PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages 2500 Vol. 6 compilation in Japan in 2004 (re-released on the PlayStation Store in 2013), and the Sega Classics Collection, the only English localisation, in 2005. In 2002, a service allowing games to be downloaded to a mobile phone was launched. Reception was mixed: although the graphics and gameplay were praised, some reviewers criticised the mini-games themselves. Puzzle &amp; Action: Tant-R was followed by two sequels: Puzzle &amp; Action: Ichidant-R, featuring a mediaeval theme, in 1994, and Puzzle &amp; Action: Treasure Hunt, featuring a treasure-hunting theme, in 1995.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T08:00:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed6/ed64456e8cdede443af120a90c504f86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Wii", "Game Gear", "Genesis"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
