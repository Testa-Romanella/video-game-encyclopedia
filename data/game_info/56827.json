{"id": 56827, "slug": "super-pipeline", "name": "Super Pipeline", "name_original": "Super Pipeline", "description": "<p>Super Pipeline is a 1983 action puzzle game released for the Commodore 64. The objective is to keep a series of pipes unblocked so that water may flow through them. Enemies include saboteurs that plug up the pipes, bugs that fall from the ceiling to kill the player, and a monster that patrols the pipe in later levels. The player is armed with a gun that can kill bugs, saboteurs, as well as the monster (but only from behind), and is followed by a helper that can remove plugs and kill the smaller bugs. In later levels, a series of walls protect the enemies as they climb the ladder on the right towards the roof. A level ends when a set amount of water enters the barrel at the end of the pipe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d73529d58f80719c7b0bef2ef3050eca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Taskset"], "esrb_rating": null}
