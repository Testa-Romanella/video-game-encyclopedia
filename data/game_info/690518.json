I estimate 1-3 hours on a first play but most playtimes once practiced will probably be under 30 minutes.<br/><br/><strong>Basics:</strong></p>\n<p>* Z jumps, also Z and ENTER select things and advance text.<br/>* Q to beat a level when you're testing it<br/>* Pretty much everything else we tried to explain via UI or level design.</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Stay tuned for, in future versions:</strong></p>\n<p>* Level selection<br/>* Possible expansion/semi-sequel level pack.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to keep future improvements in mind when making your Oktrollberfest judgments; we'd appreciate it. Nonetheless for jam purposes, this is the official entry.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy it! It's been a big labor of love for all of us.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f1/2f18daf788d4eeb78577edc52f4e099a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kkairos"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
