The game was published by EA Sports and released on November 30, 1995. The PlayStation and PC versions were the first games in the series to feature a 3D rendered court, allowing for multiple camera angles using EA's \"Virtual Stadium\" technology (also used by FIFA Soccer 96). The on-court player graphics remained 2D sprites. It was also the first NBA Live game released for the PlayStation. NBA Live 96 is followed by NBA Live 97.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-25T17:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afb8071a1427b97b0b46e1a221e59d72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 582, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Game Boy", "SNES", "Genesis", "PC"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts Canada", "Electronic Arts Sports", "Tiertex Design Studios", "Hitmen Productions", "Hitmen Canada"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "THQ"], "esrb_rating": null}
