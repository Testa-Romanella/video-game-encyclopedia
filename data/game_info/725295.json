We have put tons of effort and love into this game, and we hope you enjoy it! The game is about a choice between control and chaos, the Funky Monkey or the Chunky Monkey. This mechanic informed the rest of our design choices! We also knew that we wanted to keep the game accessible to everyone, so we added<strong> key remapping</strong> and <strong>assist mode,\u00a0</strong>despite the smaller scale of the game (: For those who want an extra challenge, you can take on 3 bonus levels unlocked only after completing the 10 level campaign.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We Hope you Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T10:20:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ed/1ed9c49b2af3a8594744efecac9e8e85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamer Hangout", "Rowannie"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
