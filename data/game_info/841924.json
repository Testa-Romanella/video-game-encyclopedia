Move fast and think\u00a0faster as you work with limited resources to survive as long as possible.</p>\n<p>This deceptively challenging game is all about optimizing your moves and thinking ahead of time. The mechanics are simple, but the strategies are anything but simple.<br/></p>\n<p>Explore 40 levels across 3 worlds in a layout that allows you to go at your own pace. You may want to steadily knock out level after level, or become obsessed with achieving perfection on a single level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T13:47:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9db5b975b8524d32ecd3e9805465171a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["elsewhere games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
