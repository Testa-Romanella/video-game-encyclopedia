It's a low poly city procedural generator.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>WASD\u00a0</em>: Move around</li><li><em>Generate\u00a0</em>: Procedurally creates a new city.</li><li><em>Center+/-\u00a0</em> :<em>\u00a0</em>Change the city's size, which will be updated on the next city generation.</li><li><em>Number Display\u00a0</em>: This is the size of your city. It determines how many tiles fit either vertically or horizontally in the city.</li><li><em>Left +/-\u00a0\u00a0</em>: Manage the zoom of the camera.</li><li><em>Camera</em> : Take a screenshot. If you're playing on a WebGLPlayer this button will only hide the UI for 5 seconds for you to take a screenshot. When used in Windows or Mac this will save an image in the game's directory.</li><li><em>Exit\u00a0</em>: This button does nothing in WebGL, but exits the game in Windos or Mac.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Future plans:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>I'd like to add car AI, which I kind of did create, but because of a hard-to-solve error I haven't been able to add vehicles wandering around. So if you are experienced with Unity's AI and NavMeshes, send me a message through Twitter, please!</li><li>Wheater: Not only rain and fog, but also a day/night cycle.</li><li>More building variety: I actually have a good amount of modular pieces I modelled which could be cool to implement and generate even more weird buildings!</li><li>More detail: from street lights to signs.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T03:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d46/d46f8480bbd9cf3a593d7b787dec7142.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["uri677"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
