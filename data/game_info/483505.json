To move right or left you need to press\u00a0 Z &amp;\u00a0 W (The Z key on the keyboard is to move left &amp; the W key on the keyboard is to move right). Note!! to close or minimize the game, you do that through the task bar. Also the game is not on LTS (long term support) so there will be no update of any sort.
