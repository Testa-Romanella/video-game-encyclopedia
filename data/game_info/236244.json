However, I\u00a0was quite busy with other errands this weekend,\u00a0and didn't get to spend as much time as I\u00a0wanted on the project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The theme for the jam was randomly generated for each contestant. My theme was \"A game where you rethink random worlds with your eyes closed.\" I\u00a0tried to make a game where the player draws the art himself, thus \"rethinking random worlds\". I really liked the idea, but it was a bit difficult to execute because I had to work with a lot of Unity Components that I don't have a lot of experience with. If I\u00a0had another 10 hours or so I\u00a0think it would have run a bit more smoothly, but hey!\u00a0At least it's been a great learning experience!</p>\n<p>Good luck!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1b/e1bd8f6f568fddea724460461f88ae07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LuckyFeathers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
