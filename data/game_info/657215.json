The result is not perfect, but I was almost learning Pygame from the beginning and I'm proud of what I have done, as I have to deal with lot of problems and errors that I had to solve without research, as there is low signal in my village. Hope you enjoy the game (may be a bit hard)\u00a0:D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:34:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66c/66c1b3b0f72068aee49a941ab8e3392e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Demo20"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
