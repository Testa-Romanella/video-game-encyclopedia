But when Finneas vanishes in the darkness of Terry's new home, it's up to little Terry to figure out what is going on. Is Finneas actually a demon\u00a0 causing havoc?</p>\n<p>This is the first game by the Flaming Trapeze Game Studio, and we're excited to finally have our demo ready!\r\n</p>\n<p>A/S for left and right\u00a0movement.\r\n</p>\n<p>F to turn the flashlight on and off.\r\n</p>\n<p>H to hide if something is nearby.\r\n</p>\n<p>Search the new home to find clues and hunt after the seemingly friendly Finneas!\r\n</p>\n<p>This is our first ever venture! All of the visual assets have been created using digital painting programs, and the only song also not created by the artist (Nolan Neikirk) plays during the intro sequence. Any feedback you'd like to give, we're down to chat! We really want to start getting our ideas into game form, and this is the first step.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you like what you see, we'd love your support on Patreon!

Thank you all!\r\n</p><p>PS: PLEASE let us know if either of the two files have weird things (like the MC zipping across the screen. Some of those things were for testing purposes, so I do apologize!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T10:12:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/825/82565c6ee7409fcf62ab5f3824a32d95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Flamingtrapeze"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
