A high ranking wizard of the acadamy of magic who just finished an epic adventure (https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/fire-loop). And what better way to end an evening than with friends and a tankard of mead?<br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately Edelbert might have had one mead too much and blacked out somewhen in the night. Now - still hungover - he wakes up besides his bed. Smaller than usually and in the form of a pig. What happened?<br/>Luckily enough he has all the ingredients somewhere\u00a0 in his apartment to reverse this foul spell. You need to find them and put the into the big cauldron to mix up the potion. Your \"reveal\" spell, the only one you can remember right now, and your agility will help you.</p>\n<p><strong>Find 5 ingredients to transform yourself back to a Human.</strong></p>\n<p>To see where those ingredients are hold down your left mouse button. That casts a \"reveal\" spell which reveals the closest ingredient to you. Then grab the ingredient and throw it into the big couldron. Rinse and repeat until you collected all 5 ingredients.</p>\n<p>Beware the anti-magic orbs that will try to suck away all your mana. You can banish them if your reveal spell hits them though.</p>\n<p>And when you run out of mana... the game is over and you will stay forever in this godforsaken form.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use<strong> W, A, S, D</strong> to run around. the <strong>space bar to jump</strong> and your <strong>mouse to look around</strong>. Use the <strong>left mouse button to cast the reveal spell</strong> (hold until revealed) and the<strong> right mouse button to throw an item</strong>. You can only cast the reveal spell while not holding any item.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Violeta Juskova: Character design &amp; UI Art<br/>Kevin Meissner: Programming<br/>Alexander: Prop design<br/>Carsten Ruhr: Props &amp; Level design<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T07:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a2/1a2c9fc0738f96ef166a5967f612ea80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dac-xp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
