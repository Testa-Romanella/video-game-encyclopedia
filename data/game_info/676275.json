Then collect them from chests (and a well) on the level and put them one by one to the alchemy table at the top right corner of the level.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can see ingredients that are on the table by going close to it. If the correct sequence of ingredients is broken, the table goes unstable and you need to put a stabilizer (bottom middle chest). And hurry up, because otherwise the table will explode and you will lose the customer\r\n</p>\n<p>Try to sell as many magical potions as possible before losing three clients. Btw, ingredients the potions are made of are unstable too. Try not touch the walls with them\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:</p><p>\u00a0move with WASD\u00a0</p><p>rotate potion around you with left and right arrow buttons\u00a0</p><p>push and pull potion with up and down arrow buttons\u00a0</p><p>run on Shift</p><p>\u00a0interact on E\r\n</p>\n<p>The game made with CocosCreator We used Spine, AdobePhotoshop for animation and art Audacity for audio editing</p><p>Background Music: \u201cFarm\u201d Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T12:33:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2b1ec9b20a24a07486a2b9ca76528e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kpded"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
