To interact, simply make the player bump or walk over the tiles.</p>\n<p>Each level is cleared when the player character grabs the key and brings it to the key lock. Wooden obstacles are in the way, and the player must destroy them to reach their goal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reset the map with Z+X if you are stuck.</p>\n<p>Bump into objects to interact with them.\u00a0You beat the game after 8 levels, and get your final time.</p>\r\nTORCH\r\n<p>Torches are in each level, and necessary to beat each. Simply run over their corresponding tile to collect it, and then bump into a tree or wooden object to light it on fire. Only one use per torch.</p>\r\nFIRE\r\n<p>Fire spread in the 4 directions as time passes, as long as it has contact with something made of wood. It can't spread diagonally!</p>\r\nCRATE\r\n<p>Crates can be pushed around the level by bumping into them. You can use them to redirect the fire spread and connect otherwise distant burning trees. You can only push, not pull them.</p>\n<p>Be careful - you can't move a crate that's caught on fire!</p>\r\nBOMB\r\n<p>Set up to collapse the canyon if they are to explode. Don't let the fire spread and touch the bomb, or you'll have to restart the level!</p>\r\nKEY\r\n<p>Necessary to beat each level - run over its tile and bring it to the keyhole.</p>\r\nKEYHOLE\r\n<p>The end destination of each level. Only lets you go if you have the key with you, of course!</p>\r\nBehind The Scenes\r\n<p>A\u00a0lot of little systems for this one - especially the checks I have to run to make sure the fire doesn't multiply uncontrollably!</p>\n<p>I am very satisfied with it tho - it's mesmerising to watch the fire spread unto things and leave their ashes behind! I kept playing and re-playing the levels just to watch it a few more times...</p>\n<p>I think it's also the first puzzle game I have ever made! I gave it my best, and hope everyone will enjoy.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game made in Pico8\r\n</p>\n<p>Design and Programming by KaaSnake\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by KaaSnake\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:16:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a223a1029bd81294f6d087b0d7cc141.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KaaSnake"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
