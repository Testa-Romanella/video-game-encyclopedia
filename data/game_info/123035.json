You seem to have lost track of yourself.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPull Yourself Together is a visually-unique adventure game that imitates the graphics of old-school vector games. Explore this strange world and take on its challenges to gather pieces of yourself and seek a way back home. There's more pieces out there than you have room for, so which ones will you make yourself out of?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMade with the help of Moonlight Neo to be short, sweet, and free of charge. Playable in twenty minutes, though has no save feature, sorry.\r\n</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Now has some background music!
