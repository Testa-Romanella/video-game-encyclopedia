Earn money by killing the viruses and use it to purchase new weapons or upgrade existing ones! Stronger enemies appear as you last longer in the game. Can you survive long enough to purchase the NUKE to eradicate all viruses (and face the hidden boss)?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>ORIGIN:</strong> Originally made this game for the 2020 Epic MegaJam. Felt that a lot of work has been done on it during the jam period, so decided to polish it up and take it further beyond the scope I had set out for the jam.<br/></p>\n<p>Trigger warning: I portray Coronavirus as a cartoonish looking character in this game. I realise that it is a real thing, so player discretion is recommended if you think you might get offended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T06:01:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/7937022e8ced2e7e18d7c7df36945935.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ggGam3s"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
