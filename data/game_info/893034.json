Some have turned to illicit money making schemes just to get by. You are one such wizard!</p>\n<p>Sell illegal spells on the internet with your trusty Spelltronix-450 by writing words to match your customers requests. Balance your elements (consonants), try not to use too much crystal (vowels), and make sure your spells are the right level of power (word length).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not every request is possible right out of the gate, so you might have to settle for a less than perfect spell. But with more cash comes the chance to upgrade your set up -\u00a0raise your prices, get more bang for your buck, and repair your very dodgy keyboard.</p>\n<p>Just be careful not to spend all your coins in one day!\u00a0You're barely scraping by as it is. Lose too much cash to the ever increasing taxes, domain costs, and ingredient prices and you might just end up bankrupt!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>BG art from\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Some UI elements and avatars from\u00a0https://kenney.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Font from https://itch.io/profile/somepx</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T04:42:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/868/868174732fdd25e990c2092deb9e6f90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WheelsRPGs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
