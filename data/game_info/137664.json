Your job is to help that little ball to achieve it's dream of not ending up as a messy puddle on the ground. You do this by landing on floating platforms. Those won't help you forever though, as they float they'll rotate away. You can not escape your eventual demise, but you can prolong it for as long as possible. So this game teaches you about how eventual happenings can not be stopped, no matter how hard you try. This makes this a strong exercise in emotional storytelling. See how long you survive and compare your times to your friends!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/577/5771be52b78867f46ccd5ec6bddf3a49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JanCC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
