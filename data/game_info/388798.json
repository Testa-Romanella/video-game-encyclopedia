But somehow, the living and dead characters\u00a0can still communicate with each other by sending letters.\u00a0They don't know how their letters can travel to and from\u00a0the afterlife, but it doesn't matter. They aren\u2019t going to let go\u00a0</em><em>of the only connection they still have.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Wish You Were Here</em></strong> is a cooperative letter writing and Tarot collection game for two players, about loss and mourning.</p>\n<p>Players will take on the role of two people who cared for each other very much. One of them has died. The two can still send and receive letters from each other, despite one of them being in the afterlife and the other in the living world.</p>\n<p>As players, you will send physical letters back and forth between you and your correspondent. Each player begins with a mixture of the two Tarot decks. Your goal is\u00a0 or both players to complete their deck of major arcana. As you play, you will try to guess what card inspired the other player's letter. If you guess correctly, then you will receive a card for your deck, getting you closer to your goal. If you guess incorrectly, you will instead receive a card from the other player\u2019s deck, getting you farther away from completing your deck.</p>\n<p>If you and your correspondent are able to complete both decks, you collaborate to create a satisfying conclusion to your character\u2019s stories. But if you make too many incorrect guesses, then communication between the characters will be cut off completely, forever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:13:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff9/ff9ca45d604881702c53e6ee9da8ed29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nickwedig"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
