This game was a lot of fun to create as it wasn't something we needed to take seriously, which I think is where most of the joy of creating games comes from. I'm very grateful to be put in a position where I can do what I love doing most, which is creating games, and I'm glad to have met so many talented people along the way, like\u00a0 \u00a0@Arguswastaken\u00a0</p>\n<p> who composed the soundtrack for this game alongside suggesting some neat ideas. A lot of things in this game wouldn't even exist without Argus so you also have him to thank for helping me push out this game to you guys. Oh and @Kejayco\u00a0</p>\n<p> for making the Sadmin emoji otherwise this would've just been called Five Nights at Henry's or something.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you PuffballsUnited for making the Henry Stickmin games, I wouldn't be where I am without them.\r\n</p>\n<p>Anyway yeah spooky sadmin game go play now you sissy.\r\n</p>\n<p>Windows notes:\r\n</p>\n<p>Windows might tell you that it's by an unknown publisher. press more info then press run anyway to play it.\r\n</p>\n<p>macOS notes:\r\n</p>\n<p>Ignore Gatekeeper warnings by opening Finder &gt; Navigating to the application &gt; Right click &gt; Open &gt; Open.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>#fnaf #henrystickmin #fangame #horror #action #survival #pointnclick #strategy\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T16:51:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/365/365d79520295bddb9b65d74c4845e909.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ported From Scratch"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
