Is Pulled On Puffle's Appearance, And Puffle Never Knew Him But Who Did... Was Puffle's Father From The Time Puffle Was Little.\r\nAnd Puffle's Father Supports P. D. For The Guarantee Of Maximum Effort, And With That His Image Has Increased For The Population Of Robotropolis, And There He Owns The Own Building Called \"Blackbot\", The Largest Building In The World.\r\n\r\nBut P. D. Has Heard So Much About The W. D., And Didn't Want To Talk About It. P. D. It's Against W. D., AND W. D. It's Against P. D.\r\n\r\nThe plan that the W. D. wanted was to take the place of the P.
