There are standard platforms, that will appear when you are close to them, and then there are special colored platforms where you will need to get a colored orb and then get close to the platform before it appears. You also have white orbs that act as checkpoints. Memorization and trial and error is the key to beat this game. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b95/b95b4298f76cc4f119a1fd53d2f59710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["frededarling42"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
