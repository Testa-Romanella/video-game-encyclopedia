Fight the skeletons and collect candy before you have to return home for the night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gameplay is simple, run through the green start banner to start the timer. It will then let you know how many skeletons and how much candy is in the level. Run around shooting skeletons and collecting candy, and when you are finished run back through the start banner and you will get your score. Take to long, or run out of health, and it is game over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T02:50:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e23/e232fa7773c965ef909cd8ce2f0f6a53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rcole"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
