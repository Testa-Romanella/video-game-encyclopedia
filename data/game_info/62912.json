Professor promised to close his eyes to Eric's cheating in exams if the boy helps him with research expedition. Eric had no idea where exactly the professor want to go, much less that the cynical scientist just needed someone he could easily get rid of, if the things go wrong... The moment when Eric, strained under a load of his gun, saw the portal opening before his eyes, he realised that something was wrong. But it was too late to back down...<br/><br/>To survive in Crazy Science: Long Run you have not only to run fast but also to think fast! After your research advisor stole (in the name of science!) a very valuable alien crystal, angry alien aborigines started to chase both of you. But you can escape from them easily, all that you need is to adjust the hand-held portal generator and... wait, how do you adjust it? We'll figure it out on the run!<br/>Mechanic:<br/><ul><li>You'll have to run through several locations while operating an exclusive hand-built gun, which professor has made out of old rubbish in his home workshop.<br/></li><li>This gun has 16 firing modes - depending on what kind of enemy is threatening you at the moment, you set a damage type, firing type, shooting distance and power, in order to get the most killing effect. And you'll have to do all of this as quck as possible, right on the run, while professor is grumbling again and talking some scientific nonsense!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c2/8c2f987c0adec54b9b1e61af24f006e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Art Of Adventures"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Art Of Adventures"], "esrb_rating": null}
