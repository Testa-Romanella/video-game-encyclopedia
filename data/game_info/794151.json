Watch their status lights:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>If the light is green, its working fine.\r\n</li><li>If its amber, its faulty, and you should repair it.\r\n</li><li>If its red, you should\u00a0<strong>really</strong>\u00a0repair it! Any red equipment will cause the integrity of the bus to deteriorate and eventually stop.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Repair equipment by walking up to it and entering in the button codes that light up on the machine. If you enter a code incorrectly, the code will reset and you will have to start again.\r\n</p>\r\nControls (Xbox Controller Required):\r\n<ul><li>Analogue Stick: Move Left/Right\r\n</li><li>A Button: Jump\r\n</li><li>Left-Bumper: Zoom Out\r\n</li><li>D-Pad/A-B-X-Y: Enter repair code sequences\r\n</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>David Eichman - Programming\r\n</li><li>Michael Gillon - Level Design, Effects, Programming</li><li>Craig Innes - Art\r\n</li><li>David Strachan - Programming\r\n</li><li>Alicja Ukleja - Art\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T08:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b4/4b4fcf8b619199e9b0da9f95b8a8a989.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Gillon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
