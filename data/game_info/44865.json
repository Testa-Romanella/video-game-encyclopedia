Each player attempts to knock the ball into the other player's goal, but both sides can modify rules and mechanics of the game in the middle of the match to their advantage. Opponent about to score? Shrink the goal! Far behind in points? Change the scoring method! Hilariously chaotic, while also surprisingly strategic, you never have to play the same way twice.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf2f7d782615c3ed600597ce3e6c012b.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/bedlamballgame", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evan Peiperl", "Brianna Livesay"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Evan \"Solidplasma\" Peiperl"], "esrb_rating": null}
