There is no one path to take, no single goal to achieve, but the player\u2019s actions will reflect on themselves and the world, transforming and changing them both. If they are able, they may slow down time itself and forestall the fall of darkness. If not, there is always another chance; the darkness will bring dreams that enlighten future journeys.<br/></p>\n<p>The interactive design of The Night Journey evokes a sense of the archetypal journey of enlightenment through the mechanics of the game experience \u2013 i.e. the choices and actions of the player during the game. The game design explores a challenging question: what is the game mechanic of enlightenment? How can we model such an intensely personal yet archetypal experience in a game?<br/></p>\n<p>Visual inspiration is derived from the prior works of Bill Viola which provide reference for the game world, while source material for the in-game \u201creflections\u201d is drawn from the vast archive of his video footage.\u00a0Textual inspiration comes from the lives and writings of great historical figures including: Rumi, the 13th century Islamic poet and mystic; Ry\u014dkan, the 18th century Zen Buddhist poet; St. John of the Cross, the 16th century Spanish mystic and poet; and Plotinus, the 3rd century philosopher.\u00a0<br/><br/>The team created a set of custom post-processing techniques for the 3D environment that give a sense of \u201cexplorable video,\u201d integrating the imagery of Bill Viola\u2019s prior work into the game world at both a technical and creative level.<br/></p>\n<p>The Night Journey was awarded \"Most Sublime Experience\" at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games.</p>\n<p>Contact The Night Journey\u00a0support</p>\n<p><strong>System Recommendations:</strong></p>\n<p>PC</p>\n<ul><li>Windows 7* / 8 / 10</li><li>Processor: 2.4 GHz Dual Core or Equivalent</li><li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: 1024 MB NVidia or ATI graphics card</li><li>Storage: 2 GB available space</li><li>Keyboard &amp; mouse or game controller (See this\u00a0list\u00a0for supported controllers)</li></ul>\n<p>* Users running Windows 7 with Nvidia cards may need to run the game in Compatibility Mode and as Administrator.
