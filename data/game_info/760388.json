I can't begin the day without playing the entirety of Failboat x Gex: Chapter 1, I only hunger for more of this human/gecko drama.</p>\n<p>Highly recommend!</p>\n<p>From : Squilly</p>\n\n<p>If you're looking for a visual novel that will remain within the corners of your mind for the rest of your days, then this is the game for YOU.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Failboat x Gex: Chapter 1 is a visual novel like no other. This story of star-crossed lovers is so moving, so impactful, it could rival Shakespeare's very own Romeo and Juliet. From a trip to TNT town, to cafe dates, this visual novel has it all.</p>\n<p>Fantastic visuals, beautiful music, handsome geckos....truly this game has it all. I, for one, await the rest of this thrilling series.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I was definitely not convinced to write this. This is all 100% my honest, unbiased review .</p>\n<p>From : SketchySkittles</p>\n\n<p>Failboat x Gex is a masterpiece that shatters all expectations. Clearly an unsurmountable visual novel that will be passed down in history.</p>\n<p>Before first playing it I thought Gex was cool, and\u00a0 after playing it I thought Gex was cool. It's not only an amazing visual novel, but builds off others work and surpasses them. The writing outshines all other visuals novels in fact, you should delete every visual novel you own right now. Failboat x Gex cannot be compared.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ever since chapter 1's release there has been nothing that could match this level of storytelling. In fact I have a laptop only for Failboat x Gex anticipating the day chapter 2 releases. These are characters you can empathize with, the visuals and music make it an emotional rollercoaster. The only thing I want is for chapter 2 to come out faster.</p>\n<p>From : Scrubz</p>\n\n<p>The amount of time it took for someone to make a Failboat x Gex game is absolutely infuriating but it is finally here. The ship of Failboat and Gex is obviously the most popular in the community and generally a fan favorite, this game captures it perfectly. The emotion portrayed with each line is so raw it's practically tear jerking. Especially when Wincar gets upset at Failboat for being absent for one night, you can really tell that Wincar has horrendous abandonment issues. The immaculate Chad energy radiating off Gex is while accurate, also incredibly overwhelming. It's no wonder he trapped Failboat in his grasp within 3 days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From : Mint</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Send me a DM on Twitter if you have any questions, issues with downloading, a glitch, or anything along those lines :</strong></p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/BagelBandit087<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T04:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d441c3d0216702e040e1ecee2b6b19f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bagel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
