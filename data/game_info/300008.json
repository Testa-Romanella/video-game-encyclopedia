You'll probably be needing those.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>A/D or ARROW KEYS to move left and right<br/>SPACE to jump</p>\n<p>If you're running the Windows version and have an Xbox 360 controller to hand, you can use that instead.</p>\n<p>Made in 4 days with DEFOLD for Platformer Week and WGJ #86</p>\n<p><em>NOTE : at time of writing the Linux and OSX builds are untested by me.
