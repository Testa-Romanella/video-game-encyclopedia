As an investigator, you will carry out field surveys, but it is a simple job that even those with no experience can perform.<br/><br/><br/><strong>[Purpose of the field research]</strong><br/>Find an object imbued with a grudge at the site, place it in a wooden chest, and bring it back. There is a target total amount of curse points for the investigation, so if possible, please achieve the target.<br/><br/><strong>[Observation of Paranormal Phenomena]</strong><br/>At the site, actual paranormal phenomena can sometimes be observed. If you encounter a paranormal phenomenon, the smart glasses will automatically collect data, so please try to keep it in the center of your field of vision as much as possible. Since paranormal phenomena are more likely to be observed at late hours, the investigation will be conducted at night.<br/><br/><strong>[Regarding the Supplies]</strong><br/>Investigators will be provided with helmet-type headgear and smart glasses. Installing an IC chip in the headgear enables useful effects for the investigation. Smart glasses will display necessary information at all times.<br/><br/><strong>[Expansion IC Chip]</strong><br/>IC chips have levels, and their value increases with the level. Effects of multiple chips of the same type are cumulative. However, there is a maximum limit to the effects based on the type.<br/><br/><strong>[Regarding Sanity]</strong><br/>Please keep the headgear light on to maintain brightness. Sanity decreases faster in the dark. Also, holding objects with accumulated grudges makes sanity drop more easily, depending on the amount of grudge.<br/><br/><strong>[About the Research Team]</strong><br/>A research team can be formed with up to four investigators. Please assemble a research team as needed.<br/><br/><strong>[Advice from a Senior]</strong><br/>It's a very safe job as long as you keep your sanity. Until you get used to it, don't push yourself too hard, and even if you haven't reached your goals, return to the laboratory early while you still have plenty of battery life and sanity left.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T06:50:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a76/a762077b97eb3ed2a4cb1e6ca13a196a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KIMIDORI SOFT"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KIMIDORI SOFT"], "esrb_rating": null}
