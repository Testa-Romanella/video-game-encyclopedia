It was one of the earliest\u00a0arcade video games\u00a0and created by\u00a0Allan Alcorn\u00a0as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder\u00a0Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the\u00a0Magnavox Odyssey, the first\u00a0home video game console. In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement. Bushnell and Atari co-founder\u00a0Ted Dabney\u00a0were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game.\" -Wikipedia</p>\n<p>In this reinvention the players are beach-goers passing a ball that gets faster and faster and harder to stop, and there is one extra factor: it's quite windy.</p>\n\n<p>Play with a friend, it's fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1f/c1f87dc27cd28e374281aa3f7f4cfe9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["paucho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
