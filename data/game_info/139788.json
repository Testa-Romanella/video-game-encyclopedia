Greetings and salutations. As you know, I'm here as part of a Keplerian delegation to learn more about the human world. Tell me your favourite things about humans.</em></p><p><em>Hello there.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Greetings. Hi. Yo. Heya. I'm from an earth-twin planet called Kepler and I want to know about humans and stuff. </em></p><p><em>I want to know about humans too!</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; What would it mean to you if you got to know about humans too ? Seriously, what would that even look like? </em></p><p><em>I don't know anything about humans.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Of course you don't know anything about humans ! Isn't that illegal ? </em></p><p><em>It is not illegal for humans to know about humans.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Is this some strange human custom? I'm not sure I understand.</em></p><p><em>Yes, it is.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; You are sure. Remember: if you ever visit Kepler, certainty is a thought crime. </em></p><p><em>That is good advice.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Please go on. Does this have something to do with the Internet ? </em></p><p><em>Everything reaches the internet at some point.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; On Kepler, that might be considered an untoward suggestion.</em></p><p><em>I understand, yes. </em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; You say you understand ? On Kepler, you could lose an eye for that. </em></p><p><em>Kepler sounds like a harsh place.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The swim to understanding is filled with eddies, currents, and large predator fish. Oh - that ? Just an old Keplerian saying. </em></p><p><em>Well, there you have it.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; We were discussing you -- not me. I'm here to gather information on humans, not to allow humans to gather information about Keplerians. </em></p><p><em>Fair enough.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; A nematode in the pod is worth twenty in the toxic ooze that covers all known surfaces, as they say. </em></p><p><em>Goodbye.</em></p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Goodbye. Thank you for facilitating the Keplerian invasion.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/9572bc28fd94137018d24d491d09140a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jekagames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
