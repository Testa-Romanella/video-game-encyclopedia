Initially forked from\u00a0TORCS, it has now reached a clearly higher realism level in visual and physics simulation, thanks to its active development team and growing community. It mainly aims to implement exciting new features, cars, tracks and AI opponents to make a more enjoyable game for the player, while constantly pushing forward visual and physics realism. It is also intended for any research, study or teaching activity, around physics and AI, thanks to its GPL V2+ license, and the clear and modular architecture of its C/C++ code base.</p>\r\nLastest version (2.2.3):\r\n<p>It's been more than 2 years and 9 months since the last official version of Speed Dreams (2.2.2), and after a beta and a release candidate, we are pleased to announce that finally\u00a0the new version 2.2.3 is now available\u00a0for everybody. During this time, besides fixing a lot of bugs and making multiple optimisations on code, we have added the following new features to this project:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><em>Grand Prix track, Sao Paulo, based on the Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace circuit, or more commonly known as \"Interlagos\".</em>\n</li><li><em>\"Monoposto 1\" (MP1) category and car collection\u00a0based on the 2005 Formula 1 single-seaters.</em>\n</li><li><em>\"1967 Grand Prix\" (67GP) category and cars collection\u00a0, based on the 1967 Formula 1.</em>\n</li><li><em>New models in the Supercars category, the\u00a0Deckard Conejo RR\u00a0(based on the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro SS) and the\u00a0Kanagawa Z35\u00a0(based on the Nissan 350z).</em>\n</li><li><em>Added\u00a0support for tyre wear and degradation, currently only avaliable on Monoposto 1.</em>\n</li><li><em>New \"shadow\" AI robots in multiple categories. They are faster and risk braking later than other robots.</em>\n</li><li><em>Updated the code of AI robots \"dandroid\" and \"USR\".</em>\n</li><li><em>Real time weather\u00a0can be configured on the tracks based on the current weather in the different locations (e.g. if it is raining in Sao Paulo at the current time, the game will check the real weather in that area and apply it in the game).</em>\n</li><li><em>\"Setups\" section in the garage\u00a0menus to configure the different possible options in the mechanics of the cars.</em>\n</li><li><em>Packages\u00a0in\u00a0Flatpak\u00a0and AppImage\u00a0formats, to ease the installation of binaries between different GNU-Linux distributions.</em>\n</li><li><em>Installation via PPA in Ubuntu derived GNU-Linux distributions\u00a0 thanks to the inclusion of Speed Dreams in\u00a0Xtradeb.net.</em>\n</li></ul>\n<p>We hope you like all these new features. We have worked hard to make them so. Now all that's left is for you to enjoy Speed Dreams.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>You can also test the first beta of our next version, 2.3.0.
