I mean, really; it's in the name. You want out, but the city's high walls and inexplicable moat of radioactive waste makes escaping a little tricky.</p>\n<p>But you have a special power.</p>\n<p>Using a mysterious mirror you can shift into the, uhm, Mirror World...ok I'mma level with you. This game was created for a 3 day game jam and the story does't make a whole lot of sense. Just go with it.</p>\n<p>The jam in question was Aspect Manufacture's 1 Bit Weekend, where the restriction was to create a game using only two colours (at one time) using at least one of the following themes;</p>\n<ul><li>Radioactive</li><li>Reflections</li><li>Dragons</li></ul>\n<p>So that's that. The controls are standard Pico controls (arrow keys and Z / X for actions), but there's a tutorial bit in the game. This was a lot of fun to make.\u00a0It's not very long for obvious reasons, but I hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T08:20:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83b/83bf9f7c7ba8d3440372aae36d131cdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["b3agz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
