{"id": 628559, "slug": "minesweeper-in-windows-command-prompt", "name": "Minesweeper in Windows Command Prompt", "name_original": "Minesweeper in Windows Command Prompt", "description": "<p>A recreation of minesweeper running in the windows command prompt. It includes all the normal gameplay and functionality of minesweeper with ASCII art in the command console.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Select difficulty with number keys.</p>\n<p>Navigate minefield with arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Flag a square with 'f'.</p>\n<p>select a square with 'Enter'.</p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>Start off by selecting any square, your first square will never be a bomb, or have any adjacent bombs.</p>\n<p>Then notice the numbers. A square that is a number means that in the surrounding 8 squares, there is that many bombs. So a 1 means in the surrounding 8 squares, there is 1 bomb.</p>\n<p>Squares that are believed to be bombs can be flagged using f, this is done to help the player in remembering what is a bomb and to avoid accidental selection but flagging is completely optional.</p>\n<p>The game is won by selecting all of the squares that are not bombs.</p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>\n<p>*If you have never played minesweeper, I recommend starting with a version that is not created with the constraints of the command prompt as it will be easier to see and understand. I recommend trying here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T08:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/834/8342aeaa03191efbbaaa22577242d4c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Camdenvaughan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
