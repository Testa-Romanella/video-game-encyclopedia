BeanBoy", "description": "<p>BeanBoy has corrupted the forest's vegetation, and sent all of the flora wild! Wielding the power of the four Nut-Helms,\u00a0only NutLad can rise up to the challenge and take back his home!</p>\n<p>I made this game over the course of a week for GBJAM 10 - I had a hell of a lot of fun working on it, despite overscoping a fair bit. It still has its fair share of bugs, which I'd like to iron out over time, as well as finishing up the other bosses I didn't manage to fit in. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Gameboy-style controls (Arrow Keys, Z, X, Backspace, Return)</p>\n<p>Movement: Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Jump: Z</p>\n<p>Attack: X</p>\n<p>Descend Platform: Down + Z</p>\n<p>Dodge: Down + X</p>\n<p>Helmets: Backspace</p>\n<p>Pause: Return</p>\n<p>Quit: Esc</p>\n<p>Note that\u00a0NutLad's starting Acorn Helm currently has no effect other than aesthetics at this point.
