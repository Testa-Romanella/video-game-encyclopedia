It's not perfect as Sonic physics in\u00a0GDevelop proves to be hard and only a few can replicate it.</p>\n<p>More levels based on Skoopity's animation might be made soon depending on the feedback on the game.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Chaise for helping me with the game!</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/c/DLTVyt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T15:37:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d30b83eb29c67861be922ad96785dce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["DLGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
