At least that's what he told himself on the night his father threw him out. Day by day he goes to school, keeping his head down to draw as little attention as possible. But between a vicious rivalry with the private school across town, a friend who can't go one day without getting in trouble, and a strange rumor surrounding a mysterious transfer student, Hiroya finds it impossible not to get distracted, while his own life crumbles around him.\u00a0 Will he make his own way and become a champion of his school? Will he delve into the lives of his classmates? Forge new relationships? Or will he spend his senior year sleeping under the bridge that divides the town? It's up to you to decide.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Sugawara Chronicle is an anime inspired choice-based VN which splits into two distinct paths early in the game. One route will have you team up with a group of club leaders on a mission to save you school the villainous private academy and their student body president. The other route will take you into the daily life of a girl who can't help but get involved in some mischief wherever she goes. The two stories, while played independently, are highly connected, and lead to a third unlock able route in which you can have a chance to learn the true nature of the phenomena at Sugawara High.\u00a0</p><p>Full game will feature:<br/>110,000+ words across 3\u00a0story arcs, with over 100\u00a0<strong>events</strong>\u00a0that will affect the following chapters.\u00a0<br/><strong>8 major characters</strong>\u00a0with multiple poses, outfits etc.\u00a0<br/><strong>30+full color CGs</strong>\u00a0in beautiful\u00a0<strong>4k Ultra HD</strong>\u00a0resolution!
