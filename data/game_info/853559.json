Kill your way to the hero in a magical maze castle.<br />\nW,A,S,D to move.<br />\nLeft Mouse Button to hit.<br />\nSpace to dodge.<br />\nThis is a game I made by myself from scratch in all areas with a time frame of\u00a03 days for Ma\u011fara Jam #5. The theme was &quot;Bad guy is you&quot;, usually you have knight that kills orcs and I reversed that idea. Here you play as the orc after the Hero&#39;s story ended and they have won. You fight to prevent their happy ending.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you&#39;ll enjoy it.Team :<br />\nDeveloper - Ahmet Orkun Yaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T09:59:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bd/0bd01ba6ed9ec4cbd0f4211f5308f278.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orkbadger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
