To uncover the answer,\u00a0a computer AI was designed to statistically find the best control scheme for a video game.\u00a0<br/>But the AI has\u00a0gone <strong>rogue</strong>!\u00a0<br/>The trapped test subjects are being\u00a0put through a gauntlet of challenges where the controls and tasks are randomised.\u00a0<br/>How long can you survive when your controls themselves are...out of control?!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Inspiration</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for the\u00a02020 Game Makers Tootkit Jam<br/></p>\n<p>Using the prompt 'Out of Control' we began discussing what can you - as the player of a game - usually control or can at least reliably depend\u00a0upon in a game; consistent objectives, the timing of events or actions in a scene, and the physical controls.\u00a0<br/>As George had previously thought of and discussed a game revolving around the premise\u00a0of keys that perform actions switching over time, this prompt allowed us to finally play around with this idea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are four controls in the game each assigned a keyboard input\u00a0:<br/>\u00a0 - Left<br/>\u00a0 - Right<br/>\u00a0 - Jump<br/>\u00a0 - Action<br/><br/>As the player progresses through the game, a key\u00a0is randomised. The rate at which this change of control occurs increases the further the player gets in the game. Pair this with the objective of each level being different, the music slowly increasing in speed, the time window to complete tasks getting tighter,\u00a0and your poor test subject only having three lives, the player will be left feeling completely Out of Control.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Creators</strong></p>\n<p>Made by <strong>Tangled Wire Games</strong>\u00a0<br/>A two-person team of\u00a0George Fiddes and Zoe Harrison</p>\n<p><strong>The Assets</strong></p>\n<p>Made using some handmade assets and assets from the Kenney Game Assets pack</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out our #GMTKJam\u00a0 entry and please let us know what you think!</p>\n\n<p>@TangledWireGame<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:54:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0d/e0d818afe1d23da2e4ff7314edeca959.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tangled Wire Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
