Both of them created features, that are needed for a racing game.</p>\r\n1. Physics\r\n<p>In the first level contains the cars, which are simulated by the produced physics system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can take control over the different types of vehicles, which all behave differently. Drive each vehicle and try out which one is the best to maneuver through the small town with its tight curves. Switch cars using the Y-Key.</p>\n<p>All needed controls are shown in the top right corner.</p>\n\r\n2. Artificial Intelligence\r\n<p>The second level contains the artificial intelligence (ai). The cars, that were created in the first level, are used here to simulate motor races.<br/></p>\n<p>There are six prepared situations, which demonstrate the racing ai's behavior by confronting it with varying problems. You have access to them by pressing the Buttons at the sidebar or the corresponding numbers on your keyboard. More information on the individual situations and the controls can be found by extending the sidebar.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to play around and test the simulations as much as you like. We are always happy about feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:52:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef4/ef455a0071225b63a0b69726b6741328.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rattenb0y", "VanFelsen"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
