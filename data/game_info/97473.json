In order to use a skill, you will have to perform a quick minigame to determine its effectiveness. As you level up, you will unlock more skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Spells</strong>\u00a0are offensive. The base damage they deal is determined by how well you execute their minigame, but the final damage dealt is also affected by the enemy's defense against the chosen type of skill. Higher-tier\u00a0<strong>Attacks</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Spells</strong>\u00a0are more powerful, but also harder to execute.</p>\n<ul><li>To perform an\u00a0<strong>Attack</strong>, you will have to stop a series of moving sliders on the highlighted sections using\u00a0<strong>Z/X</strong>.</li><li>To perform a\u00a0<strong>Spell</strong>, you will have to quickly sort a series of runes by color (orange or blue). If they're orange, hit\u00a0<strong>Z/Left</strong>, and if they're blue hit\u00a0<strong>X/Right</strong>.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Actions</strong>\u00a0are defensive, and there are only two available:\u00a0<strong>Flee</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Recover</strong>.\u00a0<strong>Flee</strong>\u00a0exits a battle (if executed correctly), while\u00a0<strong>Recover</strong>\u00a0restores up to half of your maximum health and can cure status effects (but has a 2 turn cooldown).</p>\n<ul><li>To perform\u00a0<strong>Flee</strong>, rapidly hit the button shown. Pay attention, since the required button may change after each successful press!</li><li>To perform\u00a0<strong>Recover</strong>, you have to keep a meter balanced in the center using\u00a0<strong>Left</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Right</strong>\u00a0(or\u00a0<strong>Z</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>X</strong>). The amount of health restored will vary depending on your maximum HP and how effectively you executed the minigame. As long as you don't let the meter fall too far to either side, it will also cure any status effect you have.</li></ul>\n<p>Lastly, there are three status effects which enemies can give you:\u00a0<strong>Poison</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Dizzy</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>Panic</strong>.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Poison</strong>\u00a0deals gradual damage over time.</li><li><strong>Dizzy</strong>\u00a0has a chance to halve your base damage when you use an Attack or a Spell.</li><li><strong>Panic</strong>\u00a0makes minigames harder to execute.</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game was originally released on the PICO-8 website in July 2017.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can still find and play it there:\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=29727</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f35/f3552c7853b0ca971240124bc4068d7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jusiv"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
