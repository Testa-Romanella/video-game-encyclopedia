Conatus", "description": "<p>A game about walking in the woods.</p>\n<p>This game is more of a personal journey to me and most likely to my dev partner as well, as both of us had next to none experience working in 3D prior to this. Our goal was simply to make the best looking and immersive\u00a0environments we could with our limited knowledge, and to learn along the way. It took us a long time and a lot of effort, but\u00a0here's finally what we have to show for it. All I can say is I'm proud of what I've achieved with this, and I'm sure Kynrico feels the same. It's not anything perfect, but I hope our\u00a0honest effort shows through this.</p>\n<p>Also thanks to MrXob and his screen\u00a0for testing this thing lol</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.</p>\n<p>-aBlueHuman</p>\n\n<p>Kynrico:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/ArtenoEnjo</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/kynrico</p>\n\n<p>aBlueHuman:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/abluehuman<br/></p><p>Development history video:<br/></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T06:03:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a93/a93fb94f6631d754de501bf6709adb90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aBlueHuman", "Enjo Arteno"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
