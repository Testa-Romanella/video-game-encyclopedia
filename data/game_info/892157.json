Letting go of the joystick slowly will emulate the traction of hands slowly releasing the steering wheel.</p>\n<p>Please give me your feedback. Do you think this could be practical? Would you use this for racing games (arcade or simulation) or driving simulators (e.g. ETS2)?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Info</strong>: Running the test in Firefox doesn't seem to work.
