There's nothing here that can make me reconsider. I have no friends. Nobody loves me, and certain relatives even hate me. When I'm gone, they'll probably breathe a sigh of relief. <br/><br/>There's still one last day left to live, though. I wonder, what it would be like? As disappointing and cumbersome as the rest? Or will I find something worth living for? To be honest, I don't really believe in the second option. Even if I were to try and change something, I'd only make things worse.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Wanna spend this day with me? Well, maybe the two of us together will have a higher chance of changing something for the better... But I still won't rely on you too much. I'll just show you the contents of my life and you'll also learn that it's hopeless. And it can only get worse, trust me.<br/><br/>This visual novel depicts the inner workings of someone with a mental disorder.
