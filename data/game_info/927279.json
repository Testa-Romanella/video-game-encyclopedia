We were given the theme fragile and came up with 'Grandma's Calami-Tea'. Working on this game\u00a0was an amazing experience and a challenge, as we were a rather small team without any developers. We are very proud of the result and we hope you enjoy our\u00a0cute game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are playing as a\u00a0tea cup and the goal is to catch as many jumping tea bags from the shelf on the wall. Be aware you're not the only magical animated household object in this house. A teacup is very fragile and you don't want a fluffy paw or a falling cat toy smashing you to bits! You only have 3 lives after all!!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tech Artists</strong></p>\n<p>Felicia Larsson: game design, blue printing and FX</p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/felicialarsson<br/></p>\n<p>Franka Vleeshouwers: game design and \u00a0blue printing</p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/frankavleeshouwers<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Artists</strong></p>\n<p>Dayell De Graaf: concept, modelling and texturing</p>\n<p>https://www.artstation.com/dayellcolin<br/></p>\n<p>Yanouk Verleysen: concept, modelling and animation https://www.artstation.com/yanoukverleysen</p>\n<p>Eva R\u00fcbl: modelling, illustration and UI</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T12:48:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d5eb369bd2a0c124f28878f6d092856.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yanouk Verleysen", "dayellcolin", "FeliciaL", "Eva Rubl", "Franka Vleeshouwers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
