This provides plenty of puzzles and levels where you have to really think about how to use the BounceShot to its full potential.<h3>Make The Jumps</h3><br/>BounceShot not only tests your ability to shoot and think, but also your ability to move. Each level is timed and you will have to do some impressive platforming to get the best times.<h3>Do It With Style</h3><br/>Speed and Style are rewarded. Reflecting your own shots with a melee is one of the many style techniques that will get you bonus points and medals. There is a high skill ceiling that rewards making use of these stylish techniques.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T15:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/776/776d177cee031d7c0eedef13e4a42551.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zackavelli", "Cottage Street Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cottage Street Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
