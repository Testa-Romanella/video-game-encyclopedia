Your goal is to get as high as possible, avoiding spikes and various obstacles. Think carefully about your next move, any mistake can cost you a lot of nerves and time. The higher you are, the further you can fall.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Various levels</strong>Each next level is different from the previous one. With each new level you will come across more difficult jumps and more difficult obstacles.</p>\n<p><strong>Physics</strong><br/>Make the best use of physics. Sometimes it's worth bouncing off something to get somewhere. Unfortunately, gravity will not be your friend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Traps and obstacles</strong>Avoid traps like fire. Death is not at hand. Why die and pass a level again?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Skins</strong><strong>\u00a0for the Player</strong>There are a lot of skins available for the player in the game, you just need to find them. Everyone will find something for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Links:\u00a0<br/></strong>\u2022\u00a0Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/Coresaken<br/>\u2022\u00a0Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Coresaken<br/>\u2022\u00a0Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/RocketJump\u00a0<br/>\u2022\u00a0YouTube:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/Coresaken<br/>\u2022\u00a0Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/CoresakenGames<br/>\u2022\u00a0Website:\u00a0https://coresaken.com/</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features of the game:</strong><br/>\u2022 Challenging gameplay<br/>\u2022 Nice pixel graphics<br/>\u2022 Amazing player physics<br/>\u2022 Various obstacles<br/>\u2022 Challenging jumps<br/>\u2022 A game for every age group<br/>\u2022 Game saving system<br/>\u2022 Personalization of the player's appearance<br/>\u2022 Unlimited time to pass the level, no stress</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T08:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a172a1a892badf412778df390f2c98e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["coresaken"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
