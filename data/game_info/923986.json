You will see the only location and the only background. You need to solve all the riddles to get access to bloat and weight managment of the Margo. After each correct unswer you will have an opportunity to increase belly size or weight. There are 10 belly stages and 12 weight stages and Margo is getting pretty big at the end, so it is not my usual slight weight gain here. Also I will make one update for this game, it would be a second actor.</p>\n<p>Oh, and this is 4k game. And this is the smallest game of mines. I told you everything. now you decide :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T11:29:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/511/511d29dfa2ac78c84efa3487d46a8268.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yuliya3k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
