We, the programmers, were compelled to program games ever since playing Atari Asteroids in 1979.  Books like \u201cDr. C. Wacko\u2019s Miracle Guide\u201d  for the Atari 8-bit helped us learn the basics of programming when we were tweenagers, but it wasn\u2019t until we were fumbling around in college in 1989 and STOS arrived for the Atari ST that we really got moving on the dream to make video games.\r\n </p>\n<p> STOS combined a simple-to-learn BASIC programming language sprite editor, sound designer, and a compiler.  The whole system allowed neophyte coders to finally turn our/their ideas and creations into honest-to God compiled Atari ST games!\r\n </p>\n<p> However, tools and desire are not the only ingredients needed for success, and as you will see with the final 1.0 version of Zamboozal Poker Dice you are holding in your hands, sometimes the final product, no matter how hard someone works, maybe, should never see the light of day.\u00a0 \r\n</p>\n<p> Zamboozal Poker Dice from Wheat Media (which by the way, was our joke-name for a fake company in high school, then the name of our two-song rock band, the name of this one-game company, and one day became the name of our first short-lived web design firm)  is an exciting new take on the classic game of poker dice.  The game is for one or two players.  Each player takes turns rolling a set of five dice and attempts to make \u201cpoker\u201d hands based on the number rolled.   On their turn, the player gets the opportunity to roll the dice three times.  After each roll, the player can choose dice to reroll.  The others will remain unrolled.  The object is to make a poker-hand with the dice.  After the third roll the player must choose a poker-hand to which they will apply their dice.  With one exception, \u201cSecond Zamboozal\u201d, all \u201cpoker hands\u201d can only be used once.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n</p>\r\n 2020 Version Updates\r\n<p> The 1.1 2020 version has been updated to work with all TOS versions. We have also updated some of the music and sounds.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Full instructions included in the package</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T12:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/272/272c55b1abbe84b9ffcb0ff3c5f65fef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Into The Vertical Blank"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
