{"id": 13036, "slug": "over-9000-zombies", "name": "Over 9000 Zombies!", "name_original": "Over 9000 Zombies!", "description": "<strong>Over 9000 Zombies!</strong> is top-down arcade action blown out of all reasonable proportions. An endless horde of zombies is coming your way, how long can you survive?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So you might have already sussed out that there\u2019s a lot of undead after you. To stay alive you\u2019re going to need this arsenal of over 20 weapons. Some you might recognize but others are very experimental. Whether you want to shoot, burn, blow up or microwave the zombies there\u2019ll be a weapon for you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Keeping the barrel of a gun between you and the zombies is a good start but you\u2019ll want to stay out of the open when things get especially crazy. Scavenge scrap metal to build barricades for protection and deploy automated turrets for extra crowd control.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You don\u2019t have to go it alone. Bring both trusted friends and talented strangers into your fold and team up against the hordes with 2 player online co-op and 4 player local co-op.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This level of slaughter needs some decent beats. Using cutting edge research techniques we have been able to isolate the optimum audio for efficient undead butchery. Scratch that trigger-finger itch to the sound of intense electro-rock from Clearside.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The zombies will never stop. They\u2019re only going to get faster and nastier. Keep your eyes peeled for flaming zombies, highly poisonous zombies, zombie animals, giant eyeballs and even the risen remains of political figures. You\u2019re going to die out there so make sure you leave with a bang.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Create your own unique levels to test your mettle and the power of the zombie hordes. Upload them to the Steam Workshop and show the world your creations.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a9/7a93e91f94e711b0dc9981502bbfc3cc.jpg", "website": "http://over9000zombies.com/", "rating": 3.16, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 363, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 43, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loren Lemcke"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Loren Lemcke"], "esrb_rating": null}
