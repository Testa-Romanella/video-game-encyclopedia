The theme was \"Status Effect\".</p>\n<p>In this game, you control a character named as \"puppet\". You are his god and he asks you to take command of his body and guide him to the exit of a dungeon. In order to do that, you can make the puppet walk, jump and enter doors, but also you can change his speed (allowing not only to walk faster, but perform\u00a0longer or shorter jumps) and his mass (allowing higher or lower jumps), and even set the guy on fire! Use the physics mechanics in your favor to complete the objective.</p>\n<p>The game has three diferent endings:</p>\n<p>1) Good ending: finish the game without losing any health;</p>\n<p>2) Neutral ending: finish the game losing some health;</p>\n<p>3) Bad ending: do not click anything or press any button as soon as the tutorial ends and wait for 2 minutes.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T05:29:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3ca6c12d99c8467e69db7d1c4dcaafd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["danlibs"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
