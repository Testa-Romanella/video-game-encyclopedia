Honestly the game doesn't meet that yet, and level design leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a start.</p><p>As always, enjoy, and please share any feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29e72d0ea05764b91b899aec95372639.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel J Roberts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
