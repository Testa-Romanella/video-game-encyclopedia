A really long time. And all you have to accompany you as you return to the world you left behind is a stabbing pain in your chest. As memories come flooding back to you, you set off to find the people you left behind, and rekindle old loves \u2014 hopefully before winter falls.</strong></p>\n<p>In Frostbites, you take on the role of the dryad Maylis, who after a horrible disaster she can barely remember finds herself waking from a coma in the middle of a forest, unsure what has happened to her and her partners. Journey through a fantasy world as you experience a story of love, fear, rumination, and resilience as you explore old memories and create new passions.</p>\n<p>Created by Kari Avalon (art) and Colleen Potvin (writing), using Renpy 6.99.13.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ba/4ba70f754edf205a222af70513698641.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kari Avalon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
