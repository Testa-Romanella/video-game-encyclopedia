Your co-worker is out with a broken everything and your\u00a0boss is on vacation, so\u00a0the only person around\u00a0to get\u00a0everything running\u00a0today is... you!</p>\n<p>So hop to it!</p>\n<p>===========================================================</p>\n<p>(This game, while completely playable,\u00a0is currently in a demo state. Further updates will be released to\u00a0expand upon the experience presented here, so if you enjoy the demo, stay tuned!)</p>\n<p>===========================================================</p>\n<p>Troubleshooting / FAQ:<br/>\u00a0Q: Will this work on all Linux computers?<br/>\u00a0A: Probably! We've coded it on a Linux computer and playtested it on both Linux and Windows, but nothing is guaranteed - if the game doesn't work with your build, please feel free to leave a comment describing both the bug you encountered and your build and we'll try to look into it!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Q: Will this be ported to Mac?<br/>\u00a0A: Nope!\u00a0None of us know how to do it! Sorry!<br/><br/>\u00a0Q: I'm stuck (physically)?<br/>\u00a0A: Oops! Please leave a comment telling us where you got stuck, what command you used, and what you're playing on so we can squash the bug! After that, you should be able to type \"go outside\"\u00a0to escape wherever you have ended up.<br/><br/>\u00a0Q: I'm stuck (mentally)?<br/>\u00a0A: Here are some hints:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Remember, you are an employee! <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Three or more sets of numbers is called a 'code'!</p>\n<p> Q: Do all of the items do something?<br/>\u00a0A: No! But all the items do have funny flavor text that I\u00a0worked hard on, so it's still worth looking for all of them! :)<br/><br/>\u00a0Q: Why are you using so many exclamation points?<br/>\u00a0A: I'm very excited!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:10:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8dbafe1d86ee30a07caf7959d913031b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["pikoifishy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
