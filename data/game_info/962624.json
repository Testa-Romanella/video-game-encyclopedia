You play a \u201cgiant monster\u201d summoned by a wizard to help a kingdom of bubble people from their wretched enemies, another very similar kingdom of bubble people. Use your magic powers (which will grow more powerful with experience) to pop the \u201cbad guy\u201d bubbles and save the \u201cgood guy\u201d bubbles.<br/><br/>This is Version 0.5, which means it\u2019s not finished but it\u2019s ready to play.
