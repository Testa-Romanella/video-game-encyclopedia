{"id": 960785, "slug": "blast-attack", "name": "Blast Attack", "name_original": "Blast Attack", "description": "Blast Attack is a short and abstract top-down shooter about destroying enemies while avoiding damage. Use shooting, dashing, and a charged attack, the 'blast attack', to destroy 6 different types of enemies who can make use of 2 different types of shields and can dash themselves. Blast Attack has 10 levels each with a unique boss at the end and is built to reward rapidly destroying enemies and completing levels quickly. Collect power-ups throughout the levels to expand and improve your arsenal including multiple dash charges, a primary fire that increases its rate of fire the longer you hold it, and a super-charged version of the blast attack towards the end of the game. Beat all levels in par time to get extra bragging rights.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBlast Attack is a very simple project that is designed to be an entry point for Big Land Games. If you see potential in this game or its mechanics then look forward to what Big Land Games will put together in the future! Any and all feedback is appreciated!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-15T03:35:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77f/77fe227e7e5cddf8b5f62d7d523da657.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Big Land Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Land Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
