The Sacrificed Adventurer uses dance pad (or gamepad or keyboard) to blindly navigate through the maze.<br/>2. Minotaur uses gamepad or keyboard (or second dance pad) to cross the adventurer's way.<br/>3-\u221e. Everyone else watching the screen tries to help blind adventurer to get to the exit.</p>\n<p><em>Credits:</em><br/>Konrad Burandt<br/>Damian Komorowski<br/>Sebastian Krzyszkowiak<br/>Mateusz S\u00f3jka</p>\n<p>Made at Global Game Jam 2016 in Pozna\u0144</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba5a7dce2997327c574fe492a7ae3484.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DOS", "Klonrad", "Threef", "matsoj"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
