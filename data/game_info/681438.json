That means I am not a big studio, I am just an individual who has, with the help of many other artists, been able to create an open world game. <br/><br/>All the assets in this game are unique. From 3D models and animations, to vehicles and audio, there is no stock art included in this project.<br/><br/>Please join me in celebrating what Blender and the UP Blender Game Engine can do!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T02:48:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bd9d914565f7d294cd321c352a71d50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Murphy"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Feral 3D"], "esrb_rating": null}
