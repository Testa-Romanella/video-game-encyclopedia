The old empire was destroyed and the civilizations in each world have suffered different fates, some of them have continued contact and others have lost it. These worlds have been separated for such a long time that many of them would not recognize each other.<br/><br/>The legend says that two forces, one negative, one positive, are trying to recover the old empire and all of its crowns again. But we know very little about these forces or if they really exist. Other people are simply trying to understand what happened and the real nature of each world. Meanwhile each world continues with it\u2019s own way and history.<br/><br/>Recently, strange things have been happening\u2026 News is received from many places that problems are appearing; the normally peaceful villages are now at war, odd monsters appear in valleys where there was once placid ecology... Nobody knows why\u2026<br/><br/>The chain of communication between the worlds remains partially abandoned, partially destroyed and so unstable that to use it is a sure way to cause even more problems and dangers. A long time ago the Great Wall in Heliopolis was built to protect the civilians. Many people have used the portals but disappeared without trace. For this reason you never know how you will be received in any of the locations or if you will get anywhere at all.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T02:32:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/8590a2ccc1e5eff6a84755127cf4ff2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 92, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 538, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["THQ Nordic", "Eurocom"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "Nordic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
