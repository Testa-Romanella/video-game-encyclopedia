My name is Anton from Finland and this is my thesis game for my school. The game is quite small and I had to use only 260h for this project. The schedule was tight and this was my first time working with a platformer and animations,\u00a0so I had a lot to learn.\u00a0 These things considered, the result is pretty good.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I did the game design, level design, 2D art, animations and particle effects.\u00a0So (almost) all visuals that you see here is my work.\r\n</p>\n<p>The programming and audio came from one of my colleagues.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy playing this game, and if you want to, feel free to give me some feedback/comments.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks! :)\r\n</p>\n<p>Game's idea:\r\n</p>\n<p>You are controlling an aztec era Eagle Warrior, who has been cast into a different dark realm by some kind of sacrificial ritual.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Warrior\u2019s health is constantly decreasing, so you are in a hurry to collect soul orbs, beat enemies and solve simple puzzles to achieve the eternal rest.\r\n</p>\n<p>You are facing hidden traps, spiky roots, deadly falls, and tormented warriors, who are stuck in this forsaken realm. Be fast, be\u00a0determined,\u00a0and do NOT give up.\r\n</p>\n<p>PS. I\u2019ve also hidden a small meme easter egg into the game, so keep your eyes peeled...\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T07:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/edaabf79a267d3891235ed8f14732e19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["antsaboi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
