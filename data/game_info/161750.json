He needs to contact the generals of hell and gain blessings from each of them. Funny, sarcastic and dark, if you love those three words then you'll like this game.<br/><br/>It's a text based adventure with some images and even more sounds. You solve puzzles and talk to interesting characters. It's got more than 10,000 words of original story.\u00a0We initially had plans for a rudimentary night and day system and an inventory system but alas the hand of time forced us to make cuts.\u00a0<br/><br/>We're a team of three people from Pakistan and we want to make originals games. Hopefully you'll allow this game to be a stepping stone to greater things than making text adventures\u00a0on Twine in our spare time.\u00a0 Please consider supporting us. Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19b/19b790d0271fb6aa29ce702b3c4fe7ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaswer.h"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
