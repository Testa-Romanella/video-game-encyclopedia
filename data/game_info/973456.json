In this game, you'll encounter a variety of lasertrons that can be reflected, refracted, decomposed into a spectrum of lasertrons, or change colors.<br/>It's important to note that white lasertrons can destroy blocks and laserpoints of any color, while color lasertrons can only destroy blocks and laserpoints of the same color. You'll also need to keep in mind that the number of generated lasertrons is limited, as well as the number of reflections for each lasertron. To complete each level, you'll need to build strategically, taking into account the possibilities of the missing game blocks.<br/>The game features 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, so you can choose the level that suits your skills. Additionally, there are two save modes available: checkpoints or passed levels, so you can take a break and continue playing where you left off.<br/>The complete game distribution includes 60 levels, so you'll have plenty of challenges to keep you entertained for hours. Get ready to clean the playing field by generators of lasertrons and show off your skills in this exciting turn-based strategy game!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T03:59:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/238/2380649324728b9402edb72036cb996e.jpg", "website": "http://graphxgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GraphXGames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GraphXGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
