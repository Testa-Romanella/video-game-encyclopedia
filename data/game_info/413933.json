{"id": 413933, "slug": "harold-sanitation-vindicator", "name": "Harold: Sanitation Vindicator", "name_original": "Harold: Sanitation Vindicator", "description": "<p>In the world of RTP (RPG Maker default graphics), Harold is considered the slug of the crew. The weak link in the party. He has to start pulling his weight, and gets a job. Of course, Harold dreams big, and he can't be a simple \"<em>sanitation engineer</em>,\" or \"<em>garbage man</em>.\" No, he has to be the <strong>SANITATION VINDICATOR!</strong></p>\n<p>This is a short game developed specifically for RMW's \"RPG Maker Day\" event that follows a couple of rules:</p>\n<p>It must use RTP</p>\n<p>It must be based on a mini-game type event common to RPG's.\u00a0 As such, there will be two downloads, a \"rpg\" version and a \"mini game only\" version to be able to work with both \"jams\" so to speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What's more, I kept my development time under 20 hours for an in-group game jam.\u00a0 In closing, I try to always put in a beginning, a middle, and an end to these sorts of projects. I can't leave it as a mini-game. Poor Harold (RTP Character) deserves more than this!</p>\n\n<p>I had a good time making this title, and I hope others can get a laugh out of it too.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This is a work of fiction, and no harm came to any creatures, trash, rubbish, or people named Harold in the making of this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3c/f3c0ff3857a8708acc173613de61e70e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Failsauce GameWorks"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
