The player navigates through a dungeon while trying to avoid ghosts that will kill the player on contact. The goal of each level is to collect the key and reach the portal to advance to the next one. Every so often, the lights will go out and the player can only see themselves, the key, the portal, and nearby ghosts.\u00a0The player cannot see the terrain or faraway ghosts during this time.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the arrow or WASD keys to move the player. Collect the key by colliding with it and advance to the next level by colliding with the portal. Press 'q' to open the menu where you can save the game, load from a previous save, or exit to the title screen.</p>\r\n\r\nLevels\r\n<p>Specter currently only has five levels and I might decide to add more at a later date. You may choose to create your own levels using the\u00a0Tiled Map Editor\u00a0without the need for\u00a0programming skills. Create the map, name it \"lvlx.tmx\" (x being the level number) and the game will load the map for you. You can use the existing maps as a guide to making your own level.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T03:21:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cf/7cf97b1aa19ca84b159d776e8618a705.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr. Curry"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
