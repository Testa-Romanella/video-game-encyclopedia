You play as a filthy fraudulent voter, running around a tiny version of America to collect your eight ballots and get to one fo the five voting booths around the map. On your way you might see those damned Mexican rapists, the border wall with Canada, and the grizzly visage of future president Tronald Dump, who will be coming after you to stop you from cheating at the polls. Good luck!</p><p>For almost a year, I've been working on a web comic called Tronald Dump 2016! on Tapastic, and it's my most popular comic to date. Since I was in a video game design class this semester, I decided to abuse my new skills to create a slender-style game out of it. Hope you enjoy it!</p><p>This game is VR compatible, but it is not recommended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/430bccd26e3e4ab7c019463bc61f2632.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MonsterGenome"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
