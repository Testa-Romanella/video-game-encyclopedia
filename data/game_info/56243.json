Tom &amp; Jerry: War of the Whiskers lets you choose from nine different characters, including Jerry the mouse and his feline nemesis Tom. You then duke it out in 11 destructible environments--battlefields which range from a twisted laboratory to an unstable construction site. Each character has their own strengths, weaknesses, and moves, but skillful use of weaponry can quickly turn a match in one&#39;s favor.</p>", "metacritic": 63, "released": "2002-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T18:22:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/62f/62f9614ca2cb75ac0e7aeafa0b502c4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["GameCube", "Xbox", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["VIS Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment", "Success", "NewKidCo"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
