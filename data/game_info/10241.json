{"id": 10241, "slug": "thief-ii-the-metal-age", "name": "Thief II: The Metal Age", "name_original": "Thief II: The Metal Age", "description": "<p>Thief II: The Metal Age is a first-person stealth game, the second installment in the series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game\u2019s narrative takes place a year after the first game. The main character, an elusive thief Garrett, is tasked with resolving a crisis brewing in the metropolitan City. Different factions fight for influence and schemes are put into action to undermine each other\u2019s plans. As the story progresses, the protagonist finds more clues about the mysterious prophecy that tells about the end of humanity and risks his own life to prevent it from fulfilling.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game heavily emphasizes discreteness and stealth, as the guards of the City may often try to stop the main character. Visibility and sounds play a crucial role in completing different tasks, and utilizing the surroundings can help get rid of enemies without confrontation. Different gadgets can be used to mask the sounds, obtain enemy\u2019s location, and snuff out the lights. However, the playable character can still use his weapons to get rid of pursuers, but on higher levels of difficulty, doing so ends up in defeat and the need to restart the mission.</p>\n<h3>Visuals and features</h3>\n<p>As with its predecessor, Thief II employs a refined AI system, where enemies can notice sudden changes in the environment and react correspondingly. The lighting and shadowing have also been revamped, albeit keeping the same noir mood to the locations. The graphics of the game are awe-inspiring for its year of release, as each texture is highly detailed, and physics are made to be life-comparable realistic.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2000-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-27T00:01:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f04/f04030abc433df09da4bb70a74bdf339.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.11, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 214, "owned": 2108, "beaten": 92, "toplay": 49, "dropped": 44, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 173, "suggestions_count": 444, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 174, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Looking Glass Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": null}
