Battle a horde of birds with your trusty RT Reizo-390 LaserRifle\u2122, and gather allies along the way - do try to avoid the bullets, though! What's the highest score you could get? I'd love to hear it in the comments!<br/></p>\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n\n<p>Controls, for the curious:</p>\n<ul><li>Left mouse movement - move your flock</li><li>Left mouse button - fire</li><li>Right mouse button - gather your birds in tight formation</li></ul>\n<p>And that's it! You don't even need a keyboard.</p>\n\n<strong>MY THOUGHTS<br/></strong>\n<p>It was good fun making this game, particularly on the polish side of things (related to finishing up the game, not the country). Comparing it to past shmups I've made, it's definitely an improvement on how fun it is to play with, and how easy the thing feels to control, at least in my opinion. I would've liked to get more content done, though, since there's not much beyond the main gameplay loop of shooting things, and some more variety in enemies and player characters would also be great to see. Even some sort of progression between playthroughs, like buying new bird types or different levels, could've been useful - if only I had infinite time! Still, for only 48 hours over a weekend it's a good start, and I can always come back to it and easily add more content, so there't that! And, of course, I get to keep everything I learned in making the game as well. I hope you liked playing it as much as I liked making it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T04:37:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/22134a32f35c40f5b26e55550722857d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cakestorm"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
