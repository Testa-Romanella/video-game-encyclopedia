It only really found a game loop in the last 24hrs of making it. I spent most of my time just enjoying making a landscape that actually looks like something with the given limitations. The Dialog was written late at night so it could have some spelling issues, but that doesn't really matter.<br/></p>\n<p>the beeps at the beginning are meant to be there (I dunno I thought it was cool at the time)<br/></p>\n<p>This was a fantastic gamejam to take part of, thanks a lot to the hosts. But GOD I do not want to see the colour green ever again.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Upscaling the low resolution was achieved by using\u00a0GBCamera for Unity https://roguenoodle.itch.io/gbcamera-for-unity<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T10:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/087/087306a7ecf930b191225890c1b32b19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["CrayonMelon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
