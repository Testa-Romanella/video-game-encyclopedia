We got in the jam a little late and worked last 5 days to finish this but when we got to the submission page, we realized that it takes a week for Game Jolt to verify your address if you live outside of the listed countries. So we kinda gave up, but since it was already finished we decided, we should share it with people anyway...<br/><br/>We won't be able to release updates for a while (because we made this with the temporary license that was provided for the duration of the Opera GX\u00a0game jam), yet we would love to hear your\u00a0comments or suggestions on how \u00a0we can improve the game anyway.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T14:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/181/181bc1a87e2c24e61e1e21df403a3b2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ruunvald", "hushuskurukafa"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
