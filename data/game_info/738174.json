Made it purely for fun, it's not good at all, your slower than molasses at the start, only a big and small cactus, and your score doesn't save. Overall only play it if you really want to. If you want you can try and beat my high score (About 620), assuming boredom doesn't kill you before then.</p>\n<p>If you do play it though and have any feedback then I'd love to here it, hope you enjoy and Cheers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T03:53:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9de1fa8f6a82a8a434a5e9031a5affc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ATACOMANS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
