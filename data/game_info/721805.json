For each lap you complete you get 10 seconds added to the timer, pretty basic idea that is quick to get into and have fun with.<br/><br/>The track itself is a figure 8, with a bridge that you both go under and over through the course of the track. And it has been tested and tweaked to prevent exploiting the track to keep from cheating it and getting laps earlier than should be doable, it is needed and essential to do it the right way.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T07:16:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e0/3e0f3d817cefa865181bc87d8ed642c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hydra_derg"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
