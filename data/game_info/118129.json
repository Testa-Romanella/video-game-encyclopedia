The premise is that you have lost your marbles and need to find them while making your escape from the insane asylum. The wardens appear as deranged monsters based on medical tools. The demo is only one level. Make it out of the room and get to the elevator to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If there is enough interest, a full, polished version of this game might be developed.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/243864d9fe964afcdfdd894a6dc88778.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["katrinaschmelter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
