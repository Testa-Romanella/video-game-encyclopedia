Raiders are a common nuisance and contracts are often brought up against them. You, a bounty hunter, seek out and fulfill these contracts for anyone willing to pay enough. Along the way, you keep all of the best gear that you find when scavenging and sell off the rest to make up payment differences. This time, you found some old Night Vision goggles that the raiders had scavenged and they did not like parting with them. They are chasing you along a road that led you to an abandoned store. The bike slips, you crash, and now you have to use the goggles to navigate the dark store and escape, leaving only as many raiders alive as you choose to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T09:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/932/932a3ee632168e7a106381958eedd529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArtUSpringShow2019"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
