The objective is simply to get to work on time, however, your job location is different every day and the building always seems to be in a rather inconvenient spot. Simply get to work on time to complete each level.</p>\n\n<p>I'm honestly not sure if I should try to make the \"raining cars\" more of the star of the game, or remove it focus on the driving-platforming aspect.
