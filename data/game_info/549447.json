Questions have only one correct answer and consist of three options. There are 10 questions in total in the game. If you know the questions you will get 1 points, if you do not know you will get 2 points. A little different from other games you play, answering questions incorrectly will result in more points. So why is this so? Because when you reach 10 points, the game is over. The more questions you answer correctly, the more fun Christmas trivia you will encounter.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Score Logic</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>If you know the questions correctly, you will encounter 1 golden apple, if you know wrong, 2 golden apples. So you know how many points you have. You can go to the question boxes to see the questions, or you can use the shortcuts on the keyboard for each question.\u00a0</strong><strong>There's no winning or losing in this game,\u00a0</strong><strong>as I think it's\u00a0</strong><strong>against the Christmas spirit!</strong>\u00a0<strong>Like I said, you have to answer questions correctly just to see more questions.</strong></p>\n<p>Question shortcuts</p>\n<p>Q1:Q \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Q2:W</p>\n<p>Q3:E</p>\n<p>Q4:R</p>\n<p>Q5:T</p>\n<p>Q6:Y</p>\n<p>Q7:U</p>\n<p>Q8:P</p>\n<p>Q9:F</p>\n<p>Q10:G</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4e68d89d5d567a403cdfd7204c96f91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["elcineker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
