Bring the action and fun into the real world as you face off in wild-west duels, cow-milking competitions, a copycat dance-off, and more. Each game takes advantage of the Joy-Con controller features of the Nintendo Switch system in different ways. While the action unfolds off-screen, the audience watches the players themselves instead of the screen. That makes it as hilarious to watch as it is to play\u2014an instant party amplifier!</p>", "metacritic": 58, "released": "2017-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-19T12:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57f52ac1794c3f290f630b939e1f2709.jpg", "website": "http://1-2-switch.nintendo.com", "rating": 3.18, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 21, "beaten": 60, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 38, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 69, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 71, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
