Each turn they will attack your Bravery, Hope, and Confidence. If you run out of any of these, you will start to gain bad emotion cards, that will hurt your Resolve if you play them. Reach 0 Resolve, and you will succumb to your inner demons. Make it out of the dungeon before this happens, and maybe you will retain your sanity.</p>\n<p>This is an entry for Bevy Jam #3.

Typically on a turn, you get 5 moves before you have to end your turn, but some cards may enable you to get bonus moves for a turn.</li></ul>\n<p>The following items can be found in the dungeon, which all gain you positive emotion cards.
