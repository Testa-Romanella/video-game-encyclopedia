Basically a glorified low-poly scale model right now.</p><p>Made in XNA 4.0. Be sure to download and install it before running this project! https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.a...</p><p>This is my own engine so the collision detection is very rough. It is quite interesting math though, basically I took the 3d position, the lookAt vector, and all of the triangles in each mesh and ran a set of barycentric calculations to calculate slope and intersection. It is quite slow to do that O(N) but that was all I could think of. Also the stars are laid out using a spherical point algorithm to make a consistent density, which was another challenge in itself.</p><p>The one cool thing is that by doing that I can make it much slower to go up hills like in real life!</p><p>In the future I would like to implement a body, abseiling, ai, a properly textured environment, and pretty much the entire game. Let me know how to improve with a comment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70e/70e8f2eafb4a1d34a84d54e360ba8be4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EV_"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
