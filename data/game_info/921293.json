The main goal is to collect the other roots while trying to reach out to the tree on the surface. That way, these roots can save the tree from destruction by a buldozer. While the gamers try to accomplish this mission, the atmosphere invites them to explore other creatures in the underground world. This atmosphere is not always similar to the real one - however, it is certainly gives an idea about what an exploration is.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T21:29:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b25/b25ec8b70dfd1d1537804b4980621786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["craftedanomaly"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
