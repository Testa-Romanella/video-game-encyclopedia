Though she can be untrusting of others, she greatly values the people she shares a bond with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Asami is good at hiding her emotions, so she turns to art and literature to express herself. She's currently undertaking an internship at Edo Publishing in the editorial department.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Love interests:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Asami's classmate and the charismatic leader of Touzaka Uni's Art Club. Shinichi may be street-smart and shrewd, but he maintains an approachable disposition. His peers respect him for his prowess in art and literature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A former student of a fine arts university \"BiDai\", Shinichi is two years older despite being in the same year level as Asami. For some reason, Asami treats him coldly and his jokes(?) always roll off her back...</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Yuuya is another intern at Edo Publishing, but he's in the marketing department.\u00a0As he has never had a girlfriend, his senior colleagues at Edo often try to pair him up with Asami or tease him about other things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has poor eyesight and wears glasses on a daily basis. Yuuya is a polite and well-mannered man who is good at his job, but seems to be hiding many secrets...?</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Guillam is confident and ambitious, but also a bit of a flirt and may come across as shallow. His Japanese is good enough to carry out everyday conversation without trouble, though he still slips up occasionally.</p>\n<p>He initially came to Japan on a business-cum-holiday trip, but ended up staying due to various work-related reasons. Guillam is passionate about art and his career, being a firm believer of mixing business with pleasure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\r\n\t====================================\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Soundtrack:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t*************************************************************\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>System/Specifications: </strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To ensure that Kokorogawari is working properly you should have following system requirements:<br/>\r\n\t- Windows XP, Visa, 7, 8 or 10\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Linux\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t- Mac OS X 10.6 and higher \r\n\t</li>\n<li>Heroine sprite will show with a great variety of expressions, so always check out the sprite expressions!</li>\n<li>Original game interface designed by Sechiruu!</li><li>Dictionary function!</li></ol>\n<p>5.
