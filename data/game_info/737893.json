That would be bad. Don't crash into anything, either. That would also be bad.</p>\n\n<p>The circle around the penguin represents the strength of your flap, so clicking rhythmically is better than just clicking frantically. We didn't think of any better way to represent that before we ran out of time, so the circle is a holdover from the initial prototype.</p>\n<p>I realize now that if a flying penguin were to collide with a balloon, the balloon should be the one to pop. That would make sense. But this isn't about making sense. It's about a flying penguin.</p>\n<p>Made with Ezorus aka Salazin aka my sister, who made all of the art and animations.</p>\n<p>Fonts used:\u00a0Holly Wings and Unicorn Handwritten <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T11:23:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f8/5f8b42422cb978f6114008385730be74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["phlp", "Ezorus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
