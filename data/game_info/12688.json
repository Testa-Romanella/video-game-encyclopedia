It is your first day of work as a housekeeper at one of the most luxurious apartment buildings in the city. However, before you can power up the vacuum cleaner for the first time, a mysterious person informs you that you will be making a lot more money than you were originally contracted, but instead of cleaning apartments, you will be demolishing them. At first, you hesitate, but then you realize how this much money can change your life.<br/><br/>Housekeeping VR is a Virtual Reality game for the Vive and Rift.
