It is intentionally straightforward, exploring a well-known mechanic to create a focus within the world. It was created as a senior thesis project during the 2019-2020 school year. A year is not long to create a game, especially working as a (mostly) solo creator. \u2018The Road Diverged &amp; I Had to Go Home\u2019 is the result of such a work schedule, starting with a much larger idea and being cut and revised back and forth until it reached its final state. Here, far from the original idea, is a small excerpt of rural life, where everything is an adventure, if you\u2019ve only the eyes to see it.</p>\n<p>The game is able to be played using the WASD and Spacebar keys on a keyboard, or using a console controller. Tested with an Xbox controller; please let me know if others present issues.</p>\n<p>Music was created by Brittany Harris. More of her artwork can be found on instagram @brittanyharrisart.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:21:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06efdf933cf22a792ee43a78a0381ec2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dorianeason"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
