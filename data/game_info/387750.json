The horses need a rest.\" Those were the coachman's last words before he disappeared without a trace. Lost deep in the Black Forest, you soon find out that some things should remain buried forever.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SYSTEMS</strong></p>\n<p>Currently available as a HTML version only, which will run on any modern operating system with a Javascript enabled browser, The game mimics the look and feel of 16-bit era text-adventure. We are planning a release for C64, Spectrum, CPC and Plus/4 at a later date.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>TEXT ADVENTURES TODAY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Curse of Rabenstein  is following the paths of the legendary adventures from Level 9, but it tries to meet modern era expectations, so that the most profound game genre of the 80s still works today. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Generally you may use the  in-game HELP function to get a basic overview how to play the game. <br/><br/>PARSER LOGIC: The game conforms to a two word logic, e.g. EAT APPLE.</p>\n<p>INTERACTION: The objects you urgently need to interact with to complete the game are visible under YOU NOTICE. Please keep in mind though that you sometimes need to interact with the room descriptions to discover a new object which is then accessible for you. <br/></p>\n<p>EXAMINE / SEARCH: A pretty important but anachronistic practice is to EXAMINE objects you can interact with, so you learn more about them or get useful hints. Sometimes you also need to SEARCH to progress further. Please note that EXAMINE and SEARCH is not the same in this adventure and thus may trigger different results.</p>\n<p>DYING: As scary as this game is, you can't die in Rabenstein. There are also no dead ends. The progress is very linear.</p>\n<p>HINTS: We recommend to draw a map.</p>\n\n<p>Eight Feet Under is (c) 2019 Stefan Vogt and Puddle Software.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:01:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e366adc694ec2a850cf559b04f92298.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stefan Vogt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
