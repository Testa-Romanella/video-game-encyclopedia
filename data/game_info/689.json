This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his hunt for dangerous fugitives after a disastrous prison break.<br />\nTACTICAL COMBAT<br />\nUse the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, distractions, personal shields, proximity mines and more.<br />\nSTEALTH<br />\nChoose your approach with care. Some say running into the fray guns blazing isn\u2019t always the best option. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use disguises and covers to sneak past irrelevant guards. Use silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers.<br />\nLOAD-OUTS &amp; GEAR<br />\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon in each mission - and there\u2019s something for everyone. Shotguns, handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbows, energy weapons, throwing axes and more.</p>\n<h3>IMPORTANT ### Please note that iPhone 4 is not supported.</h3>\n<p>\u2022   Tactical top-down shooter<br />\n\u2022   Episodic storyline in three chapters - ALL chapters out now!<br />\n\u2022   Gorgeous stylistic HD graphics rendered in Retina resolution (full Retina not supported on iPad 3)<br />\n\u2022   Optimized for iOS 8 and Metal graphics!<br />\n\u2022   Wide range of weapons and gear<br />\n\u2022   Performance based mission rewards<br />\n\u2022   Multiple factions to fight with or against \u2013 or pitch against each other<br />\n\u2022   Dual stick controls with a set of different options<br />\n\u2022   MFi controller support (requires extended layout)<br />\n\u2022   iCloud save game support<br />\n\u2022   GameCenter achievements<br />\n\u2022       English, Deutsch, Fran\u00e7ais, Espa\u00f1ol, Italiano, \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587, \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4, \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e, \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, Portugu\u00eas do Brasil</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2015-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T21:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d7/1d7576a6ab5ab2cb5d77e280f6a5358a.jpg", "website": "http://www.pixelbite.se", "rating": 4.25, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Pixelbite"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Pixelbite"], "esrb_rating": null}
