Now you can challenge Facebook friends and opponents around the world to compete in in real-time matches! <br/><br/>*HOW TO PLAY*<br/><br/>Goal:  Make the number 24 using all four numbers on the card! <br/><br/>Solving:  To solve cards simply tap on a number OR slide between two numbers and select the desired operation (+ \u2013 x \u00f7). You can add, subtract, multiply or divide. Each number can only be used once and yes, there is at least one solution to each card! Most cards have multiple solutions. <br/><br/>Difficulties:  There are three difficulty levels shown by dots in the corners of each card \u2014 1 Dot cards are easy, 2 Dot cards are medium and 3 Dot cards are tough! <br/><br/>Strategies:  Choose one number on the card and turn the other three into the numbers you need. For example: If you have a 4, try and make a 6, 20, 28 or 96.<br/>Common Patterns that make 24: 6x4, 8x3, 12x2, 24x1. Don\u2019t just look at the numbers independently, but as two pairs. For example: On the card 8, 7, 5, 4.  Add 7 + 5 to make 12 and 8 divided by 4 is 2, so 12 x 2 = 24. <br/><br/>*FEATURES*<br/><br/>Multiplayer:  Compete against your Facebook friends or opponents around the world in head to head challenges!
