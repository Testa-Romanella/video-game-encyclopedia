On the track and through the streets, race against a variety of characters, each with their own personality, racing style, and friends or foes. Fly around the track at breathtaking speeds of 1,000 miles per hour in single player and multiplayer action, including split screen, and system link. Unique competitors - From decommissioned war droids to spoiled rich kids, interplanetary playboys to robot political activists, each opponent has their own attitude and style. Take it to the streets - Take your supersonic blade off the track and challenge an opponent to a one-on-one illegal race on city streets filled with ramps, tunnels, obstacles, and more. Develop your driving skills, learn new tricks, and continue to shave seconds off your best times as your experience evolves. Realistic damage - Panels buckle or are wrenched off, hydraulics will malfunction, smoke will plume from the blades, and you&#39;ll have to avoid debris that falls off other craft.</p>", "metacritic": 54, "released": "2004-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-17T05:51:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e02/e02abdd6d8612a37e1a8f5dcf35862e7.jpg", "website": "http://www.zoodigitalpublishing.com/product-item.php?id=36", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 329, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Argonaut Games", "Michael Powell"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "ZOO Digital Publishing", "Mud Duck Productions"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
