Will she become a member of the Mage guild, or of the Adventurer&#39;s guild? Will she find out more about her heritage, or will she be too busy working extra time in sleazy bars to make a living?</p>\n<p>The game will feature several factions, each with their own goals and objectives. With your actions, you might willingly or unknowingly benefit this or that group, as the event unfolds, but the open-world nature of the game will leave it up to you if you want to get more involved with the politics of the world, or if you want to just do your own thing.\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-01T21:37:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf7/cf7ed481007484710a15b327a89829da.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3591468", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
