There's also a limited set of resources you have to thoughtfully allocate between all of these layers. All the while you're aided by Hero, who's crawling through a dungeon full of monsters in search of resources to help you build up the Wilderness, the Village, the City, and what lies beyond...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures a class system, a faction system, an alignment grid, a mission system, quests, collectible items and characters, offline progress, achievements, and more, so much more.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOther notes: this game is primarily idle. There is no clicking mechanic.
