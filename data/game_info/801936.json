It's far from done, as more and more features are coming.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Stella Dei is a sandbox game for those who are thrilled about the idea of controlling your very own little planet. By controlling all physical aspects, you can have an Earth-like planet or make it rotate so slowly that there's one hot side and one cold side.<br/>And now, add life to the equation. Even more, the game is open-source and free.<br/></p>\r\nCreate\r\n<p>Each time you play, you have an unique planet, bare, with no life  and instable conditions. And this planet's fate will forever be  affected by your actions.  \t\t\t\t</p>\r\nMake life\r\n<p>In livable planets, you can send a meteor in order to beta-test  life on your planet. If it lives, great, if it dies in horrible  suffering, maybe adjust the climate a bit.\r\n \t\t\t\t</p>\r\nDestroy\r\n<p>As you hold the power of changing the world in your hands, you  may experiment what a few more CO2 might do, or if a 2\u00b0C rise won't kill  most living beings. The world and its delicate harmony is yours. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Community</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There's also a small discord community where I show pictures of new features and new bugs :'( and it's also where you can directly suggest me ideas or tell me valuable feedback.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T10:08:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d151e0f0731594bebac0858041b7561.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["zenith391"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
