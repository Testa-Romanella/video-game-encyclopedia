Your boomerang will always hit where you point it to go(except when hitting walls, in which case it bounces it back to your character). Once your boomerang hits your target/bounced off an wall, it will ALWAYS return to your character, no matter if it hits a wall or you change your position, allowing the boomerang to move in a curved path.<br/></p>\n<p>You have 5 classes to choose from, each with their own perks:</p>\n<p>1. Default - Slight boost to each stat<br/>2. Speedster - Double speed<br/>3. Agilius - Animations are twice as fast, and boomerang goes twice as fast<br/>4. Tank - Double health<br/>5.
