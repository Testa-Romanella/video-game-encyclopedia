Previously referred to as the best agent I-DIE - the International Directory of Intelligence and Espionage - had to offer. Now known by your colleagues as nothing more than an occupational hazard. You're far from the agent you used to be and even then, it's taken you years to piece back together some semblance of your old self. \r\n</p>\n<p>You've been out of commission longer than not, all of your time being dedicated to your rehabilitation which, honestly, was for the best. So why now, riddled with PTSD and more baggage than you know what to do with, have you been thrown back into action?\r\n</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, it might be what finally breaks you.</p>\n<ul><li>Play as Atrax, an agent of once great renown, and customise their gender, appearance and sexuality.\r\n</li><li>Choose your tragic backstory and the moment that changed you forever.\r\n</li><li>Further tarnish your reputation or work to rebuild it.\r\n</li><li>Build and repair relationships with a cast of characters.\r\n</li><li>Make questionable choices that both challenge your morals and break several laws.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Roman Hensley | The Politician </strong><em><strong>(male, he/him, 36)</strong></em>\n</p>\n<em>Roman Hensley is a politician of the people, for the people. He's put forward an award winning campaign, coupled with some big promises that he's already proved he's able to fulfill means there's an election win well within his reach. He's got a calm, controlled aura to him but despite the air of invisibility that he puts forward there are whispers of a scandal, a plot, an attempt on the man's life. Good thing you're there to protect him... right?</em>\n<p><strong>Nadia</strong><strong> Richmond | The Psychiatrist </strong><em><strong>(female, she/her, 37)</strong></em>\n</p>\n<em>After everything she's seen and done working as the top psychiatrist for I-DIE, Nadia is as jaded they come. She has a tendency to be pessimistic in her views of the world and a bleak outlook on her own personal life, yet the care and compassion she shows for her patients never fails to shine through. Her dedication to helping your fellow agents is the only reason she hasn't quit but with you as her number one priority, that dedication is wearing thin. </em>\n<p><strong>Carina/C\u00e9sar Santos | The Ex-Best Friend </strong><em><strong>(gender selectable, 37)</strong></em>\n</p>\n<em>More professionally known as Agent Redback, C was once the only person you could count on. Kind and charming, full of excitement and equipped with an infectious smile, you were drawn to them like a moth to a flame. The exact reason for your drifting apart is lost amongst all other reasons you're careening closer to the edge of the line but they never once stopped caring about you and they'll do whatever it takes to keep you safe, even if that means taking them down with you.</em>\n<p><strong>Ailbhe Townsend | The Boss </strong><em><strong>(non-binary, they/them, 39)</strong></em>\n</p>\n<em>As the head of I-DIE, they are a constant intimidating presence in your life. Their stoic silence is sharp and intense enough to put even the most fearless of agents on edge and you are no exception. You're not entirely sure why they still put up with you or why you still even have a job but you're not going to start questioning them now. After all, you get the feeling that this your last chance to get back in their good books and if you fail... well, being unemployed will be the least of your worries.</em>\n<p>Template made by\u00a0a.w. morgan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T13:10:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/269acc64c38df020bf871fa6fed77618.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noahspickettfence"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
