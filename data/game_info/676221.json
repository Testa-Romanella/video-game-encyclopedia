You'll have to figure out the various interactions of the ingredients through trial and error but\u00a0be careful because the potions are less than stable and have a limit on how many ingredients you can put in before they explode. The ingredients and how they interact with the potion's colour are randomised every game for a fresh challenge each time, but this also means you should keep a pen and paper handy to keep track of all the combinations you've discovered.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T12:21:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e4/6e4b1adbe8d78cdc63a6c7883ac27e6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Morglom"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
