You play as Tux, the Linux mascot. Tux's friends have been captured by Nolok and hidden in many forts around the world. Along the way, Tux meets allies who will join him on his quest to save the free software mascots.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is an amalgamation of classic Mario, Sonic, and a hint of Metroid. Each level can earn badges based on how you complete them, and best times are tracked per level.</p>\n\n<p>This game is fully open-source and supports mods and bonus level packs. Make new levels or even your own game with it!
