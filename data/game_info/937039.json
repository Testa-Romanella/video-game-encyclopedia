They can't go on trees or on roads. Then click the Orange button at the bottom right to start combat.</p>\n<p>During combat, you can move with WASD. Going near your Booch pond will give you a bottle that you can use to refill your towers with SPACE. If the towers run out, they stop attacking.</p>\n<p>For now there are only 3 waves and 1 level since I ran out of time.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Eerywax: Coding, Game Design</p>\n<p>Joey Wheeler: Art, Character Design<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T09:46:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f9/3f985e97fa6703d2f459960fe3f58afb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eerywax"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
