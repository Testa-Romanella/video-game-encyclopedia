{"id": 974559, "slug": "my-friend-the-spider-2", "name": "My Friend The Spider", "name_original": "My Friend The Spider", "description": "A small \"horror\" narrative game about isolation and depression.<br/><br/>My Friend The Spider is a 15-20 minute walking simulator where the player finds<br/>themselves voluntarily locked in a room to escape and isolate due to their current emotional<br/>state and befriending a spider that grows in size with the story's progression.<br/><br/>I originally worked on the game for a month and a half around October 2022. My idea was to experiment with the Unity engine in order to practice my coding and get used to the engine. I had a short story in mind based on personal experiences and thought it would be a good idea to flesh it out as a narrative \"game\" instead. Everything bar the art assets was done by me. My wife helped with the voice acting (and emotional support).<br/><br/>After releasing it, it got quite a few number of views and plays - seeing people's comments about how they were moved by it, I realized a Steam release was in order. I took my time, but after sitting down and fixing some nasty bugs and others (white text on a white background? Really dude?) I am now happy to release it on Steam and let it be free with a nice, deserved final update. <br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it.
