You'll be able to play it with your friends on bigger maps and will have to work together to rebuild your walls and avoid being attacked. <br/>- Add new environments like a starship being attacked by aliens, a house being attacked by zombies, a vampire defending its castle against people... And much more. <br/>- Add different powers and abilities to each playable character. <br/>- Add even more crafting of different items which can help you defend yourself in different ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p><strong>Caio Vinicius- 3D artist.<br/>Eric Fernandes- Sound Designer and Game Designer.<br/>Lucas Barletta- 2D artist.<br/>Felipe Giuffrida- Programmer.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T06:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3ea102f93176e23abad7601125d31d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eric_fernandes"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
