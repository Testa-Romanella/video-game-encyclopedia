Usually, any game with an 'others' tag would be far more frequently played, and that 'others' could mean anything.</p>\n<p>An endless game genre is still few and far in between. It is a type of game where we could play it anytime, and will never be finished. This game project relies in the endless-game point where the player will have to plan ahead between using two characters with different skill sets and weapon-usage-availability.</p>\n<p>So, what's this project's all about?</p>\n<p>It is an endless RPG adventure game where the player/user controls two characters simultaneously while fighting enemies in the path.\u00a0This game will challenge the player's eye-to-hand movement and reflexes. The main goal of this game is to get the highest score possible in a run.</p>\r\nNotes\r\n<p>Since time constraints and team member issues halted this game's development, this game is still in Pre-Alpha.
