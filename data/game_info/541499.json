All game entities are composed of components. There are no inheritance trees. Game logic is all managed by systems that iterate over relevant entities in sequence. Check out my ECS on GitHub.<br/></p>\n<p>The game itself is simple. You play as a cute yellow bird that is trying to eat some tasty worms while avoiding obstacles. The difficulty curve is increased as the bird runs faster and faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T03:25:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/775/7759d18f6f45ba582909561e468f3788.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fightlessbirds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
