Dash into the die to roll it and dash into red guys to kill them. The outcome of the roll determinates number of enemies to spawn. Also die roll resets the timer, if timer shows 0 - you die (pun is not intentional, I swear).\u00a0</p>\n<p>According to this blogpost on average you will need about 14.7 rolls to get every outcome, goodluck!</p>\n<p>I tried to make \"Roll or Die\" somewhat colorblind friendly, so if there is any problem with that - give me some feedback in the comment section.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow keys to <strong>run</strong></p>\n<p>Space bar to <strong>dash</strong></p>\n<p>ESC to <strong>exit</strong></p>\n\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<p>Pixelated Camera by Ocias (really good and easy to use pixel perfect camera, I haven't encountered anything like this one.\u00a0 I would defenitely recommend this one over others.

If you haven't participated - I stongly recommend you to try yourself out in some other jam. If you haven't finished in time and feel sad about that (i've been here countless times)\u00a0- don't be sad, just try again next time or finish your game anyway. The feeling of fulfilment is\u00a0worth it 100%. </p>\n<p>(If you spot any mistakes - sorry, English is not my native language.
