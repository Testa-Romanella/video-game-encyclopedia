Use your health bar to cut through a constantly increasing number of enemies, and get paid along the way!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Use WASD to Move.</p>\n<p>Use Left Click to Attack (3 Hit Combo).</p>\n<p>Use SPACE to Dodge (with invincibility).</p>\n<p>Use Right Click for a weak\u00a0Boomerang.</p>\n<p>Press E once you have a 20 or more combo to Heal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press R to skip the tutorial, and to restart when dead. (It auto restarts if you wait)</p>\n<p>TIPS:</p>\n<p>Your scythes range is longer the lower heath you are at, so don't panic, and use the range to your advantage.</p>\n<p>You heal based on your combo amount, so if you aren't about to die, hold onto your combo to stay at low heath longer.<br/></p>\n<p>You gain combo based on the damage you deal, so try and land your powerful 3rd strike on as many enemies as possible! You can dash (space) mid-strike to connect with even more enemies, or the same enemy twice.</p>\n<p>The Ogres have a very long range, so it is best to take them out as soon as you see them, timing your dash's invincibility to go over their shockwave.</p>\n<p>Click off of the screen to pause.</p>\n\n<p>My Gold Highscore:</p>\n<p>48.2k gold</p>\n<p>Max Combo (in a different run):</p>\n<p>331</p>\n\n<p>Programmed by me in 3 days, sprites by my brother.</p>\n<p>Bug fix 1: Get webgl version working properly.<br/></p>\n<p>Bug fix 2: After surviving for very long, it used to only spawn skeletons<br/></p>\n<p>The 1.0 version was created after these two bug fixes, but I have added more juice and fixes from comments since.
