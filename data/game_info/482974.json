I'm not a part of the Miziziziz community, but I saw the premise of this jam and though it was interesting.\u00a0It's officially my fourth game and my third game jam. The game itself is small, but I hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I may continue developing this after the jam, so I appreciate helpful ways to make it better, like bug catches or game design ideas. I'm also keeping track of any known bugs\u00a0 to help in case you get stuck. Overall, thanks! :)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You're an ex-monster, and now a one-octopus postal service employed by some mysterious boss.
