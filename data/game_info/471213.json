You only have a few minutes before it becomes Permanent. The outcome is Out of your Control.</p>\n\n<p>Developer Statement:</p>\n<p>I went Solo this year for GMTK 2020. I have no idea what compelled me to do that but no regrets. It was fun, exhilarating, frustrating, and ten thousand other emotions all in one. The feeling of relying on oneself was greatly empowering. I'm very comfortable collaborating in teams but this year, it felt like I needed to do something different. I hope you enjoy the fruits of my labor!</p>\n<p>[edit]</p>\n<p>In addition, I could not have done this without my loving wife and beautiful kids who gave me the time and supported me on my insanity. I love creating, I love making games, I love building, and even though this game is done, it never feels complete. I'm not sure if I'll have time in the future to support this. Thank you for reading!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:04:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34b/34b20d3bd22c038de5569b96022da76e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mcsquare"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
