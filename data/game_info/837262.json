Only one pair of eyes move however (most of the time ;)) meaning you will have to stay on your feet and keep moving to avoid\u00a0 death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every 3 seconds a new pair of static eyes (statics) will spawn at the moving pair meaning the game gradually gets more and more difficult in a very natural way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are also systems in place that randomly generate powerups depending on rarity. For more info on the powerups either check out <em>Update 1: A 3D Start</em> devlog or the\u00a0<em>How to Play</em> option on the main menu!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made the core\u00a0game in 2 days pretty much and am now actively working on a steady flow of content updates and QoL improvements.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/302913427\u00a0This is the original 2D version of the game made back in 2019 by yours truly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please offer constructive criticism.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T13:41:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/106/1063b8ae4736d021e245f34dcb848efd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kyloshian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
