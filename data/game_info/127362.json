Prove your love by eating as much as you can before things get too uncomfortable. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll keep score, just like any other competitive eating contest.</p>\n<p>In this game, you will eat bratwurst (and celery as a change-of-pace food) as fast as you can. Each piece of food you eat will raise your energy AND score you one point.\u00a0 When you swallow the food, it moves over to your stomach, where you must use our patented Tummy Gun to shoot the brats and keep them from falling into your stomach acid. This is bad, as it triggers your acid reflux and causes the stomach acid to rise. Fortunately, if you allow a piece of celery to fall into the acid, the acid level will drop (veggies are good for you).\r\n \r\n Don\u2019t let your energy drop down too low or your stomach acid to rise too high or you will have a bad time (and it\u2019s game over).\u00a0 But don\u2019t eat too fast, as it can be hard to deal with too many brats at once.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Space: Eat next piece of food on your plate<br/>Mouse Click: Shoot a bullet out of the tommy gun towards the mouse</p><p>Made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 40.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c2/6c2b497f1d87da28a7c7524135702de6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["A-Flat Miner Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
