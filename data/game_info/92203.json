Embrace Lady Tallowmere's dungeons.\r\n<p>Indulge Lady Tallowmere. See how far through her lovingly violent dungeons you can delve in this 2D indie action roguelike-inspired platformer.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNew rooms are procedurally generated every time you play, meaning you'll have to be on your guard for every randomly-placed enemy, elite, boss, and treasure chest you'll come across.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEach room gets progressively bigger, harder, and more rewarding the further you go.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>The concept is simple yet hard to master:</strong></p>\n<li> Raise your shield to block enemy attacks. </li><li> Lower your shield and strike your foes when the timing is right. </li><li> Jump or move to avoid traps, or raise your shield to reduce damage taken. </li><li> Find the key to advance to the next room. </li><li> Collect weapons, outfits, headgear, and shields of various rarities to aid your journey. </li><li> Turn in souls from slain enemies to increase your base stats and passive abilities. </li><li> Stay alive as long as you can!</li>\n<p>Brace yourself with your shield as you learn the quirks of each foe and trap so you can strive for that \"one more run\" high-score victory! Each dungeon is infinite in length so it's up to you to push your limits; a local scoreboard lets you track your greatest efforts.<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tAvailable for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.
