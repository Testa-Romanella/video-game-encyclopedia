Each player controls both ends of their wires separately and can use them to climb, grab, and transmit power. In the distance lies a city scape, darkened by a power blackout. In the player's journey the exit, they have the opportunity to end the blackout. The question is will they?<br/><br/>This project was created in the 2018 Global Game Jam and competed for a special iThrive Games challenge at the UC Irvine site to create a game around kindness. We strove to make a game that had meaningful decisions about when to help your friends and when to progress alone, giving a sense of gratification when players decided to help each other. ElecTRIO took first place in the iThrive challenge out of seven teams competing in the competition. Since the Game Jam, work has continued ElecTRIO's development is slated to continue.</p><p>This project was completed as my Senior year, capstone project with a team of eight developers.
