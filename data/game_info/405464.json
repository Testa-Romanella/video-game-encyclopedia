{"id": 405464, "slug": "touhou-mythware", "name": "Touhou MythWare", "name_original": "Touhou MythWare", "description": "<p>A Wario Ware-like game where you play as Touhou characters that are based on some Japanese myths that have to do their duties!<br/>It is playable but currently only has two minigames which get harder the more you play! Main Menu is not implemented, closing and opening the game again is required to replay it as a\u00a0result.<br/>Controls:<br/><br/>Arrows Keys (Kogasa Minigame) - Left: Scares children characters</p>\n<p>Down: Scares adult characters</p>\n<p>Right: Scares elder characters</p>\n\n<p>Arrows Keys (Eiki Minigame) - Left: Send red characters to hell</p>\n<p>Right: Send blue characters to heaven<br/><br/>Detailed Tutorial:<br/><br/>The Game: A Wario Ware-like game, you have 3 lives and two minigames to play, they are choosen in sequence and get harder the more you play... Losing all lives will cause a game over, how far can you get?</p><p>Kogasa Minigame: You are a umbrella Youkai with a duty to scare off anyone that dares walking into you! If you don't you will get sad and cry, losing the minigame...<br/>Scare them off by using the corresponding arrow key depending on the character you are facing! You can scare off multiple characters at the same time, but don't let their timers run out or you will be exposed! You are also not allowed to scare no one, that will make them notice you as well. Scaring a good amount of characters will make Kogasa very happy and pleased, giving you a victory!<br/><br/>Eiki Minigame: You judge everyone's souls... should they go to Jigoku to pay for their sins or should they ascend to heaven and live a calm afterlife? Eiki is on a rush to scream at Komachi and has to do her job fast! Using her judgement she can look into anyone's soul to see what they are and where they deserve to be, using that power you can easily send characters in red to Jigoku and character in blue to Heaven. Be careful though, there is a timer so you have to judge them all before Komachi does anything stupid!<br/><br/>Credits:</p>\n<p>BebeYoshi - Game Designer and Game Developer - Me</p>\n<p>Pedro1562 - Game Designer and\u00a0Game Developer -\u00a0https://twitter.com/Pedriokwewqqwe</p>\n<p>Nyutamoto - Sprites, Background and\u00a0Fonts -\u00a0https://twitter.com/nyutamoto</p>\n<p>Cuucas - Soundtrack and SFX - Discord:\u00a0Cuucas#1658</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/919/91933dfdf6fa23e745bf817245c57297.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BebeYoshi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
