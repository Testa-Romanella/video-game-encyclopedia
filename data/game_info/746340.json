Long time ago, they were banished from the real world, trapped in a realm of chaos and doom. Yet, they actively attempted to get their territories back, and take over reality. That be through tales, nightmares, and <em>fear</em>. Control the Living through manipulation of their emotions. So that one day, what they took away would return to the shadows. In the meantime, <em>Wills-o-the-wisp</em>... ghosts, fairies, or spirits of stillborn children flitting between hell and heaven.. These metaphorical creatures are sometimes seen by wandering travelers at night, seeking their way back home. They guide the living back to safety, lead the lost minds back to reality... They refer to a hope, a goal that one strives to reach. Said Evil spirits trapped you in their realm during your sleep, trying to get you stuck with them in your nightmares. Follow the Wills-o-the-wisp's path, and escape to return to reality. Though, don't be scared, and remember: <em>It is not real</em>.</p>\n<p>But what ,if...
