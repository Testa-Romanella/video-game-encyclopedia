{"id": 830075, "slug": "revival-ao-argentum-online", "name": "Revival AO - Argentum Online", "name_original": "Revival AO - Argentum Online", "description": "From the beginning of the game, each character has a race that determines their physical form and a class that determines what they excel at in the game. Throughout the game, each player's character learns skills that will determine how successful (or not) they will be at their craft. The first two attributes (race and class) are chosen by the player when creating their character. The skill attribute depends mainly on the experience during the game and is deeply marked by the way of playing and the preferences of each player.<br/><br/>The action takes place in a fictional virtual world where you take on the role of a character who interacts with other characters, whether controlled by other players or non-player characters. All interactions take place in a fantastic environment like in a traditional RPG. You can chat with other characters on the screen, and through interactions trade, negotiate, make friends or other activities. While alone you can go to different places on the map to fish, hunt, kill zombies, among other available actions .<br/><br/>Races<br/>The virtual world of AO is populated by player characters of different races. Each of them has flaws and virtues. When starting the game, when creating a new character, the player has the possibility to choose the race of his character based on his expectations and preferences.<br/><br/>Lessons<br/>Classes determine what each character excels at in the game. There are two families of classes, the so-called combat classes and the secondary classes. The former, as their name suggests, specialize in fighting other players, non-player characters, or hostile creatures. The others are the players who create most of the items used by all players in the game (food, clothing, weapons, and decorations). Therefore, both types of players are necessary for the internal economy of the virtual world of AO. When starting the game and creating a new character, the player chooses the class to which he wants to belong based on his preferences and game expectations. Players who prefer a faster and more dynamic game tend to prefer the combat classes, while those who prefer a more complex experience rich in interactions and exchanges, usually choose one of the so-called secondary classes.<br/><br/><strong>Available classes:</strong><br/><br/>Wizard<br/>It is the class that is dedicated exclusively to the use of magic, they have a phenomenal amount of Mana (which allows them to cast a large number of spells), an acceptable magic attack but they have low life points and poor agility.<br/><br/>Cleric<br/>A class that has its fair share of magic and physical attack, combining them can be quite effective, but it doesn't excel at anything special.<br/><br/>Bard<br/>Class with good magic attack, good magic defense, and good agility. It has decent health and intermediate mana (depends on race).<br/><br/>Killer<br/>Expert class in the use of the Stab skill, with a good physical attack but little mana.<br/><br/>Paladin<br/>Expert class in using weapons and armor, they have a very good physical attack, but little mana.<br/><br/>Warrior<br/>Expert class in the use of weapons and in the use of ranged weapons.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T04:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e14/e1436b5d3114e577cc4b0aea8767ba78.jpg", "website": "https://revival-ao.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 338, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revival AO"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Revival AO"], "esrb_rating": null}
