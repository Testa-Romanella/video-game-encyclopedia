This works fine though on the mac build and I assume windows too.</p><p>Keyboard is the best way to play, most controls have been mapped to controller but I didn't test it as I have no controller, so I can't vouch for how well it will work there.</p><p>If you want to skip a level, push the '=' button on the computer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T23:16:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f44/f440e486df3d755fe2322ccb61bb14c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Little Glyph Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
