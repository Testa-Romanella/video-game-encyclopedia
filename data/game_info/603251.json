The player goes through five stages between two worlds: the Absentia, a heavy world with a powerful architecture, and the Supermarket, an everyday element that everyone can hold onto. They are actually two sides of the same coin, deeply connected to each other...\r\n  </p>\n<p>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\r\n  </p>\n<p>FRAMEWORK\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game has been realized within the framework of the Master \"Immaterial Project\" of the National Superior School of Architecture of Versailles.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Students work in groups of 3 and have two months to produce their game. They have never worked on UE4. They don't know how to program. This is their first experience as developers.\r\n  </p>\n<p>They used the design workflow of the architecture industry to make it.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You may encounter some bugs. Thank you for your understanding and have fun.\r\n  </p>\n<p>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\r\n  </p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY / CONTROLS\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is a first person platformer with an intentionally high level of difficulty.
