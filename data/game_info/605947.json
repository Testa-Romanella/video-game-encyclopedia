After a few moments,  the tears came and I stayed there for hours in the dark not knowing what to do, and thinking that it would pass.   But in fact, this overdose of stress created an even worse problem for me. For months I didn't speak to anyone, I didn't take a shower, I barely ate, my room was a  mess. I isolated myself in order not to be hurt anymore, but I ended up hurting myself in another way.   2 months after hearing about my father's death, I started to see things that didn't seem real.   My perception of the world was altered and it was as if I did not even realize that time does not go back and that it is gone. I could still hear his voice speaking to me, telling me that I   am not that failing son /daughter my mother said I was.   I could still hear their screams as if the argument happened yesterday. When he was less well at night, Sometimes I saw him walking through the house, as if he were a ghost.   I didn't choose the right ways, I was lonely having lost the notion of living when I lost my hero. I chose to smoke, drug, drink, and play to forget this pain.   Over time I started to think that what I was living someone else's life, not mine. And I   decided it was time to stop making me suffer and accept the pain, only then would I feel better and I started psychiatric treatment.       </p>\n\n<p><strong>Program used</strong>\n<br/>Unity<br/></p>\n<p>As we are still in development we are still using a Unity pack to help us which is:<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/2d-game-kit-107098<strong><br/><br/>Game testing\r\n \r\n Inquiry\r\n </strong><br/>If you are interested in the game: Can we go back? and want to provide feedback about it, feel free to answer the questionnaire below:</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1L0sIywngR_4Y_blgodtwlpbkuWFVWDQk4GL7DJqjixE/edi...<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>UI Inquiry</strong><br/> https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x6lvfDjfvk5LyMhNzftUdDmpOc9zHXtHAlghm8DN3KQ/edi...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Social networks<br/> </strong>If that interests you and you want to know more, I kept an eye on our social networks to follow our work: </p>\n<p> https://www.indiedb.com/members/gamestudioakemi<br/>https://www.instagram.com/gamestudioakemi/<br/> https://twitter.com/AkemiGame </p>\n<p>And Other: </p>\n<p> https://allmylinks.com/gamestudioakemi <br/> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T05:36:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6e/c6e15b59974b60143333e17227535c4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Studio Akemi"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
