It's all about self-aware robots who have evolved into intelligent intelligent humanoid machines \u2013 and not for the purposes of arguing about the finer points of irony, but because the human race will have nothing to worry about.<br/>\nIn short, Outhouse Media and its innovative team have created a world with a kind of robot-like AI that is quite different to our current technology. No androids should work hard to help us get through our problems. We don't need them to do our jobs, and the machines will help us keep the peace in the process. It's the closest thing to being connected with the future, and that is the real promise.\n\nThe Elders of the Solar System \u2013 of which there may be many \u2013 expect the Machines to fix their planet's problems, and so will come together to help out those who have nothing to do but 'put all the machines to work'.\n\nWhile it's not a reality, it is a possibility. The Machines are truly the masters of the universe \u2013 a vision in which there are no limits on their power.\n\nThis is where we come in\u2026\n\nCheck out this trailer for this time-travel video game, as seen on YouTube, which shows how shepherding robots out of water and rain cubicles and into the fight with the Zombies will require keen observation, attention to detail and the best of timing, as well as, of course, more than just a robot.\n\nDownload today</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:12:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/645/645ebc4a0229f0a7e919483946965f0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
