Your job is to bring the dead bodies to the underground Eusapia. In this game you will go down to dead Eusapia to drop off and position some bodies with your brothers, but there will be an accident. You are separated from your brothers and must make it back to the surface on your own. One problem is, your oldest brother has the exit key so you need to find him to leave. But in Eusapia the dead don't stay dead, and you're not welcome here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T06:48:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be7/be750fb00bd4ded43e969f046703fabe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jdas123"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
