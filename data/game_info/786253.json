Heavy infrastructure damage is  common.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Luckily, you can buy insurance. You have the option to insure under a company called Win-surance Co.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Interact with UI by clicking with the mouse.</p>\n<p><em>When playing solo, choose \"Host\" in level lobbies.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Place towers on the map by clicking on a tower button on the right, then clicking on a square. The first tower can hit both storms and oncoming elements, but is not as strong as the other two. The second tower can only hit storms. The third tower can only hit oncoming elements.</p>\n<p><strong>Tower Defense Aspects</strong></p>\n<p>Oncoming elements wayfind from their starting point to the player's base.</p>\n<p>Players can place their towers on the grid in valid cells.</p>\n<p>Players can select from multiple types of towers, each of which have their own specifications (range, cost, etc.).</p>\n<p>The player's base has reserves that deplete whenever a natural disaster reaches it and the player must pay for the loss.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Insurance Aspects</strong></p>\n<p>Buy insurance against natural disasters (hurricanes, wildfires, and floods).</p>\n<p>Insurance is broken into premiums (paid every period) and deductibles (how much is paid out-of-pocket for each instance).</p>\n<p>Player can choose whether to buy insurance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multiplayer Aspects</strong></p>\n<p>A lobby exists before each level begins. Up to 2 players can join. The host drives the loading of scenes.</p>\n<p>Build1 and Build2 are included to facilitate running in local multiplayer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>Elements spawn out of Nexuses, which in turn spawn from Chaos Butterflies (inspired by the idea that a butterfly's wingbeats can cause a storm elsewhere). Every butterfly that crosses the screen has a chance to instigate a Nexus pretty much anywhere, which grows and grows before moving to its designated spawn point. How many enemies a Nexus spawns depends on how much it grew during its growth stage.</p>\n<p>Nexuses have a slight chance to be severe weather, which results in more, stronger oncoming elements.</p>\n<p>Player receives a set amount of money per period to pay for towers and insurance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>\n<p>Tutorialize the game.</p>\n<p>Balancing. Some levels are ridiculously difficult, others ridiculously easy.</p>\n<p>Most multiplayer features. The important bits like funds and weather spawning and tower placement still need to be synchronized. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>\n<p>User logs are generated in the Win-surance Weather Defense_Data/StreamingAssets/UserLogs/ folder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Credits\u00a0\r\n</strong> </p>\n<p>On the Earth (and of the Tree) by SackJo22 (c) copyright 2015 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial\u00a0 (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/SackJo22/49330 Ft: Jeris<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T08:53:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ec/5ecaf4470e97c3ff3e6205290b665ece.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Levi Huillet"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
