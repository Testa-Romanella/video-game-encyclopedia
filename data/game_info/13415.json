Hopefully, you'll have a part to fix it! Friendly planets, stations &amp; ships may have spare parts for you, or information on nearby points of interest. Pirates will try to chase you down for your cargo, so hopefully your cloaking &amp; shields systems are available when needed!<br/><br/>Successfully deliver your package to unlock random special challenge modes!<br/><br/>* Frantic Freighter is best enjoyed in virtual reality with tracked controllers. However, it can fully be played without a virtual reality headset. There is no game menu &amp; the game will immediately start (and restart as needed), with or without VR equipment.
