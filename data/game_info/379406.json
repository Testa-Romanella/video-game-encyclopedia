Lua file to draw a triangle</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The file gives Vertex Data and Index data for creating geometry.\r\n  </li><li>I had few problems for creating the parser for this format as for vertex data it goes down 4 levels, which can be done using 3 level also, by replacing the position table to array of 3 floats.\r\n  </li><li>The reason I did this way was because it helps me to add extra values to vertex data, for example color, and I could just create a new table called color along with position and read the value easily.\r\n  </li></ul>\n\n<p><em>Fig 4. Showing that adding color to vertex becomes easy and understandable that this color is associated with this position</em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Moreover, it becomes easier to understand that the vertex data has 3 floats in position which reflects to x, y, z.\r\n  </li><li>As for the index data it is a normal array of number, which shows the winding of the object</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Optional Challenge:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The optional challenge was to make the game look more 3 like and not plain 2d   </li><li>To make game look more 3D, I create a cube inside the game\r\n  </li><li>Below is the image of how I made co-ordinates for cube\r\n  </li></ul>\n\n<p><em>Fig 5.
