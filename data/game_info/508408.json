When these crystals are broken down, a substance is released that attracts waves of monsters to defend yourself from. You can also build different towers for defense. But you can also defend yourself with mobile units. The collected resources that are left over at the end of a round can later invest in technology updates and upgrades for buildings or units.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum system requirements:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS:\u00a0Windows 7 SP1+</li><li>Processor:\u00a0Dual Core 2GHz</li><li>Memory:\u00a08 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0512MB VRAM</li><li>Storage:\u00a01 GB available space</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Pre Alpha Test</strong></p>\n<p>It would be important to me that the gameplay is found \"good\" before I develop more content/card types/units/buildings. For that I like to start a first small pre Aplha Test. For that Please join my Discord or leave a comment here.\u00a0Thanks allot for your feedback.</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/kQxDwUr<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T07:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bae/bae05da4ca517d22234fc76ae952401e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SvenRahn Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
