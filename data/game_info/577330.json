Every day you are visited by both commoners and nobles with more orders than you could fulfill in a week. You have your apprentices helping you, of course, but sometimes you feel like they bring you more harm than good. In the end, you alone are responsible for mixing the right potions. And preferably doing it fast. There is only a certain amount of customers you can help in a day. Even though today looks like no different than your average business day, you have a strong feeling that it is going to be highly profitable. After all, hard work always pays off when it comes to alchemy. As it is claimed on your advertisements, potions brewed by you are worth their weight in gold.</em>\n</p>\n<p>In this game the player takes the role of an alchemist brewing colorful potions by combining the four basic ingredients: flower (yellow), mushroom (red), butterfly (blue) and egg (white). The goal of the game is to gain as much gold coins one as possible by fulfilling orders made by the customers. Success in the game needs quick thinking and fast reflexes as potions ingredients are flying all over the screen and it is the players job to catch right ones. It is also important to watch for the ingredients you <em>do not</em> want to end up in the cauldron. Some times they tend fall to the wrong place just at the wrong time... For additional challenge, the timer is constantly running down. How much gold can you gain?\r\n</p>\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\n<p>- Combine different ingredients in a cauldron. You can grab ingredients by clicking on them or moving the mouse over the while mouse button is pressed. Move the grabbed ingredients to the cauldron of your choices or drop them by releasing the mouse button.\r\n- Click a cauldron to mix a potion of the same color as the liquid in that cauldron.\r\n- Potions float towards the order above unless you drag it to another another. If you let go of a potion after dragging it, it will fall.\r\n- Customer rewards you with gold coins after getting enough correctly colored potions. But if a customer gets a wrong potion, they leave without giving any coins. You can also turn a customer away by clicking on the their order.\r\n- The game is over when the timer runs out.
