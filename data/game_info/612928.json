For me, there are plenty of roles that are very interesting, such as creative director, concept artist, writer, and QA tester. I have no idea how exactly each role works in the game industry. However, maybe concept artists sound better since the artist can design how things look like in games. There is more creativity in this work. Also, I think the QA tester is an interesting but somehow boring job as well. Testing problems for a game is extremely important and difficult. Sometimes, bugs are not obvious to find. Therefore, I think QA testers play a crucial role. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T10:04:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f4/8f4b517e92dce75c5c06b6a63e08663d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["applenorshypnos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
