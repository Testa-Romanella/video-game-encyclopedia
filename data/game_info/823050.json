It's buggy but still accurate. Ill fix it if anyone cares. (Game jam code, amirite)</p>\n\n<p>WEAPONS:</p>\n<p>1 - spoon. very useless. probably better to run.</p>\n<p>2 - sword. very good. kills in one hit</p>\n<p>3 - gun. 2-shot kills zombies, 1-shots skeletons</p>\n<p>4 - traps. place down spikes that instakill enemies</p>\n<p>5 - flamethrower. effective on zombies, skeletons are harder.</p>\n<p>6 - freeze ray. turn enemies into blocks of ice and kill them later!</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - move</p>\n<p>space or click - use weapon</p>\n<p>esc - return to menu</p>\n<p>ctrl - toggle ez mode. ez mode makes the game spawn fewer enemies. good for new players.
