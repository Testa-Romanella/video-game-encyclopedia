Also, you obviously shouldn't put people in an occupied room.\u00a0<strong>By the way - watch out for Homer! He's a party pooper and spoils your combo!</strong></p>\n<p>The combo rewards you for making no mistakes in matching characters to rooms. The bigger the combo, the more cash you get!</p>\n\r\nDescription\r\n<p>The game was created for <strong>47th Ludum Dare Jam</strong> in 72 hours by a team of four nerds.</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/loopocalypse<br/></p>\n<p>The topic of the game jam was <strong>Stuck in a loop</strong>. We took this topic very seriously and stuck many characters in different kinds of loops.</p>\n<p>\u00a0We hope you enjoy this short game.
