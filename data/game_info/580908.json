It took me some hours a day for 3 weeks. It's obviously targeted at an adult audience and may contain weird and nerdy themes and jokes but no gore or nudity. \u00a0The score is triggered by a lot of things, but the best strategy might be to take your time exploring to get all the different weird videotapes.\u00a0 At some places in the game, you're able to manually save the game, but there will also be autosaving at critical points. <br/></p>\n<p> I guess the fastest time to finish the game is 15mins, but expect at least 30 mins of playtime. 10 different cult movies to achieve and different route options make the replay value high. <br/></p>\n<p>So I made this game as a gift to my friends, but they enjoyed it so much and encouraged me to make it accessible to everyone. Please tell me how you think about the game and also: if you found bugs.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T08:56:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/062/06224c6e69a84fa76806360c0add2a14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DonToraneko"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
