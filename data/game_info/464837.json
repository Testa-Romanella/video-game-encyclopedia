Some upgrades needs you to press the assigned key to use it. (For example, If you have the jump upgrade assigned to 'X' key, then you must press 'X' in order to jump)</li><li>Your (and your JOTTEL's) objective is to find the POWER CANISTERS scattered around the map and carry them to the central lobby room's control station to recharge the power. There's total of 10 required POWER CANISTERS, good luck.</li></ul>\n<p>===============================================<br/></p>\n<p>This game is almost like any other metroidvanias, but I decided to get a bit experimental with the game.<br/>Getting ideas from the jam's theme, \"OUT OF CONTROL\",\u00a0 I made it so that in order to use the upgrades, you have to 'spend' your controls. This was at certain point, the user would run out of available controls to assign the items into, leading to some item-juggling shenanigans.</p>\n<p>I was quite happy with the initial ideas of the game, but ultimately I don't think I'm satisfied by the resulting game &amp; execution of the idea.. Perhaps, I can build upon this idea &amp; game later?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:37:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed0/ed0433ea4cf33913b018c471b3ccc82d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zik"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
