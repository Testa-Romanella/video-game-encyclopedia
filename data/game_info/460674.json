{"id": 460674, "slug": "fractured-plutos-heart", "name": "Fractured (Pluto's Heart)", "name_original": "Fractured (Pluto's Heart)", "description": "<p>Fractured is a Contemporary Visual Novel with some mild supernatural elements. A new face in the bustling city, you must befriend the cast of characters you encounter, if you have any hope of unraveling its mysteries. Be warned, not everything is as it seems. Stick your nose where it doesn't belong and you might find yourself among the large number of disappearances plaguing the city.</p>\n\n\n<strong>Development</strong>\n\n\n<p>Fractured is still in early development.<br/>Along with the main game that will be posted here when it is released, there be several other projects related to Fractured posted here, including the demo and additional content that doesn't show up in the main game. For example, right now you will find that we have posted a small side story focused on Elle, Theo, and Violet, three characters who will make appearances in the main game.<br/></p>\n\n\n<strong>Fractured Pure</strong>\n<p>Fractured Pure is not a demo for Fractured. Pure is a side story we created to show one of Elle's previous relationships. Pure is a kinetic visual novel, and doesn't contain a lot of the features that the demo of Fractured will contain.</p>\n<strong>Credit</strong>\n\n<p>Fractured was developed by Pluto's Heart Studio.<br/>Programmed and Lead by Kain Oborin<br/>\r\nWritten by Lunar<br/>\r\nArt byNick Beja<br/>\r\nTested and Shotgun Support by ZephyrVictorious</p>\n\n<p>We are always working on something or another, so if you have any thoughts, or want to support us please leave a comment and consider following us!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T02:50:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f1/1f14ffb5bc432ea7507b651fa3dda079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pluto's Heart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
