Once three boxes have been dropped the game ends!</p>\n<p>The controls are simple, click on boxes to move them around, arrange them as you like to be the best at balancing your boxes.</p>\n<p>There is a slight bug when moving your mouse too quickly while holding a box, causing the box to be dropped.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:42:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ab/7ab4295dee733fcded280963593c86e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AOG05"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
