You don't have to worry about that!<br/>In this game, all you have to do is choose a card, choose a place or person to use it!<br/>Every choice you make is represented as a card,<br/>each has its own unique effect and adds the power to the world!<br/>But that doesn't mean you can only do simple things.<br/>For example, you can encourage people to change jobs, heal wounds with magic power,<br/>or take them away in a UFO and implant something in them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The supernatural powers featured in numerous stories can be divided into three different types in this game.<br/>Holy Power, which represents the will of nature, spirits, or heavenly forces!<br/>Magic Power, which represents the terrifying demonic world, or the magical power that controls all things!<br/>Cosm Power, representing contact from the outer universe or the unknown extraordinary!<br/>The three powers are powers you use to influence the world.<br/>You will influence people's lives and change the way they live!<br/>Stir this world with the power of your choice!<br/><br/><br/><br/>But there are those who have their eyes on this world and want to conquer it.<br/>They are called the \"Dark Army,\" and they destroy the obelisks in their way and eat this world whole!<br/>To protect this world (or for \"your purpose\"?),<br/>fight the Army of Darkness with the little people who live there!<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game was designed to be easy to play and is one play to several dozen minutes long.<br/>Over 60 missions stand in a row! (More to be added with updates)<br/>Other game modes include the Reincarnation system that allows you to bring your friends and historical figures into this world,<br/>the Observation Room where you can observe the species, civilizations, equipment, and beasts of prey you discover,<br/>and Free Play where you can build your own world with no time limit.<br/>Enjoy this world even more with a variety of game modes!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-09T02:22:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/8242c7a48814c83993c7bbe5e0f732dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["The Ultra Game Changer"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["The Ultra Game Changer"], "esrb_rating": null}
