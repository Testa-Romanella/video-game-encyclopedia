Walking hell; a\u00a0short experience not really a full game so to say just something I made to tell a story. But I hope you enjoy it, if there is enough positive feed back I'll probably tell the story leading up to this in a future game, so stay tuned! Please leave any feedback you have about it, the story, the music, anything so that I can make future projects better. I did try to make it so that you can play in browser however, there were some issues with it so it will be download only until I can fix those issues.\u00a0The fire sound effect is from zapsplat.com\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:52:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c543eda209097f6a6b0d97d669f7160.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arocta"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
