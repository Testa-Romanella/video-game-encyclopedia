Was it a <em>good\u00a0</em>to wander off alone into the brambles?\u00a0Is that something a\u00a0<em>responsible person</em> would do?\u00a0What's with the candle stuff, and when does the festival stuff start?\u00a0<br/><br/>And seriously, what the hell is going on with the moon?\u00a0<br/><br/>Every episode of Festival of Wax is standalone, but only if you don't mind things being seriously surreal! If you want it to only be 90% confusing and strange instead of 100%, it's probably a good idea to do chapter 1 first.<br/><br/>Three more to go!\u00a0<br/><br/>Happy Hallowe'en and, as always, thanks for reading!\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>cw: light blood, disorientation, arachnophobia, claustrophobia,\u00a0surreal imagery and general spooky nonsense. Suitable for anyone that likes a good, very weird, ghost story - not violent, not sexual in any way.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T10:28:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b78c0b9ed62e20e32454f1876eb124d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["popculturedeathdrive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
