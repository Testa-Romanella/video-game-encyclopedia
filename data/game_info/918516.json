The goal is to collect the right number of items to open the next level and continue exploring this world.\u00a0 \u00a0In the game, the avatar moves forward on a boat. By performing the correct movement (trunk flexion, right lateral trunk flexion, or left lateral trunk flexion) when the boat is near the object, the user can collect items.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game utilizes a motion capture system to track the movements of the user and provides visual and auditory feedback to reinforce correct movements. The game also adapts the exercise prescription and progress to each player with a metric that was developed based on the findings obtained during the research of the master assignment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As patients need to exert independent effort to maintain these practices and exercises, patient motivation is frequently used as a determinant of rehabilitation outcomes, and a lack of motivation is a perceived barrier to physical activity. Thus, REEF was designed to be intuitive and engaging, incorporating elements such as graphic design, sound design, and narrative to enhance the user experience. Additionally, the game turns the exercise prescription and neurorehabilitation strategies into an immersive and enjoyable experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game provides multimodal feedback including a slider that turns green to indicate that the optimal flexion angle has been reached: Audio cues to notify when the item was collected, to warn the user of dangerous movements, and to provide praise messages for good performance. This allows users to understand how well they are performing and adjust their movements accordingly. At the end of the game, the player receives an end-of-session progress report.\u00a0 Here users can track their progress and see the improvements they had made over time.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Created by</p>\n<p>Game Developer: Samantha Orozco Carvallo\u00a0\u00a0@HormigAtomica13</p>\n<p>Supervisor: Aurora Ruiz Rodr\u00edguez\u00a0\u00a0@rorriizz</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T10:49:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67d47adab5d833bd9c673710fc4c30d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HormigAtomica13"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
