You play as a spark of light as the title implies and attempt to survive. Going with the theme of the Jam, the more you have the worse it is, the more light you amass, the faster the level shrinks. However, by sacrificing light until you become dim, you can make the walls retract. If you run out of light you die, so you must be careful. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d9613816956d0548ff99f82530a8b41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Sha Eep"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
