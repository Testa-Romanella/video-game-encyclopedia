Swap coffee beans, milk, sugar and other tasty ingredients to prepare a menu full of tasty blends. Upgrade your shop, recipes, treats and bonuses. Need a jolt? Blast-off with Coffee Rush!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOh no! The overly-aggressive Smokestack Coffee Company is stamping out local competition with its overpriced coffee that tastes like mud. Um, that\u2019s the Smokestack company \u2013 though you might have thought they go by another name. Ahem. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt\u2019s up to you to open your own coffee shop and take back all the areas of town dominated by the evil corporation\u2019s trendy cafes. Up for the challenge? While it lacks in the originality department, Coffee Rush can be as addictive as the drink itself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nImagine a puzzle game board like Bejeweled, but instead of an 8\u00d78 grid of gemstones, such as diamonds and rubies, in Coffee Rush you\u2019re playing with coffee beans, milk, sugar, whipped cream, ice cubes and other coffee-related items. The idea is to build a recipe as indicated on the right-hand side of the screen, which involves swapping adjacent items so that you create a line of 3 or more identical items, vertically or horizontally. This causes the items to disappear and make room for additional items to fall down onto the board.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA \u201cHey Hey Cafe Latte\u201d recipe, for example, might require 7 coffee beans, six milks, five sugars and four lightning bolts. Once you meet this minimum, the drink is ready and you can click on it to give to the waiting customer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSimilar to \u201ctime management\u201d games, you must make a certain amount of money by the end of the day to move onto the next level or else you need to repeat the day.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Gamezebo", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T01:43:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/798/7981990a6a842709263f504bc15d2128.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anarchy Enterprises"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixel After Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
