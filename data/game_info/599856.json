Users can toggle \u201cTimed Deletion\u201d and adjust the slider in order to control how fast the shapes disappear, or toggle it off and delete it on their own. You can swap between drawing and deleting with right click or by clicking a button. There is also a \u201cDelete All\u201d button for faster clearing. The user can change the shape, color, size and also toggle \u201cRandom Rotation\u201d for a unique outcome. You may also zoom in/out with the up/down arrow keys.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Also have the ability to click an Animation toggle to turn on/off animations for the painted objects. Toggling this on gives access to an Animations drop down.\u00a0 Animations are changed with a drop down menu and users can choose between three different animations. With the toggle on, you can also change the speed of the animations with the arrow left and right arrow keys. Users can press the key \u2018M\u2019 to move the menu in and out of the screen.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b0/4b0dead94a76e086a5a12fda0837ce78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["G-McCarten"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
