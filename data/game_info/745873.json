Distracting an enemy comes with the cost of increasing their fear. The higher an enemy's fear is the less likely they are to check out a disturbance and will detect you much quicker.<br/></p>\n<p>Use your tools to sneak around the enemies, taking them out one by one or go all out and obliterate them. And of course, the environment is your best friend.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move around</li><li>Shift key to crouch or stand up.
