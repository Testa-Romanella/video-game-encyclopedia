It is the third game in the Goemon series released in North America and Europe, following Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon, released two years earlier. Featuring platform gameplay in 2.5D, it marked the return of the series to a side-scrolling format.<br />\nThe quirky story highlights Goemon&#39;s quest to stop the evil Bismaru, who has stolen Wise Man&#39;s resurrection machine. Goemon and his friends must journey through five worlds to battle the revived Dochuki, prince of the underworld, and destroy the captured device. Each world is designed with Japanese styles and themes, and Goemon&#39;s Great Adventure continues the series&#39; tradition of offbeat, surreal humor.<br />\nThe game was received well, selling over 160,000 copies worldwide. Reminiscent of older, 16-bit games, the side-scrolling system was lauded by reviewers, who also praised the two-player cooperative mode. The game&#39;s vibrant graphics and musical score earned high marks as well. Reviewers have considered it the best side-scroller for the Nintendo 64.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:08:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68c/68cbb5ebe6c960fa7b2ee6d609ea1365.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.56, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 5, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 342, "game_series_count": 18, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment", "Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
