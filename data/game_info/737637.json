To progress, you will have to go through a series of rooms, some containing puzzles, others monsters. Those ones also hide a piece of a key. This key, once reformed, can open the front door and lead you to the final puzzle which will end the game. <br/><br/>We are well aware that this gameplay can get quite long, so to help you on your journey, we have set up a debug menu allowing you to teleport to whatever room you want. The content of each room is also written, so you can choose to go only in the rooms with puzzles, monsters, ect... <br/><br/>You can also directly go to the Boss room, which is the room with the final puzzle.<br/><br/> <em>Thank you for taking some of you time to play our game, We hope you will enjoy it !<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>_____________________________________________________________________<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>THE AXOLOTS TEAM !\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Elise Houard - Game Art : https://www.artstation.com/nyandiacat<br/><br/>Lucie Houssa - Game Anim :\u00a0 https://www.artstation.com/lunnyverse<br/><br/>Camille Paquin - Game Art :\u00a0 https://www.artstation.com/kamiye_art<br/><br/>Thomas Colot - Game Art : https://www.artstation.com/carbone147<br/><br/>Thomas Steller - Tech Art : https://malph.artstation.com/<br/><br/>Juliette Dupont - Game Art :\u00a0 https://www.artstation.com/juliettedupont<br/><br/>Selim El Housni - Tech Art :\u00a0https://selimelhousni.artstation.com/<br/><br/>Alyssa Louis\u00a0 - Game Anim : https://ahzz.artstation.com/<br/><br/>Sandra Ige - Deborah's Voice<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T10:14:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e4/5e4a8948b4bf1f3f7b3c8a4cce98b887.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alys_Lou"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
