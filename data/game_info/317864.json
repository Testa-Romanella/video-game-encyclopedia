Find coins to randomly buff your max health, defence, offence, agility. They can also heal you. Catch is that\u00a0from a flip of the coin you could also loose those gains. Also half the map would apply those buff to you while the other side buffs the mobs and vice versa if you go to the other side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the left side of the map is too hard, just hope you can de-buff them\u00a0\u00a0by the coins collected from the right side.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T07:49:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05b/05bb6c0ba6599e6391c22b0105e0013c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RowdyWabbid"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
