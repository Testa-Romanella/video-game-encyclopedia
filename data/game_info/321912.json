With his purple ball buster in hand, he said to himself, \u201cThere is only room for one ball in this world.\u201d Then, he puts on his jacket and exits the porta-potty to explore. He sees other balls rolling on the plateaus of the savanna. \u201cHow I despise them,\u201d he thought. \u201cI must bring balance to this ball v. ball world\u201d, as he snaps his fingers. </p>\n<p>\u201cRun from it, dread from it, I will come.\u201d</p>\n<p>*ONE WEEK LATER*</p>\n<p>Covered in lotion for his wrinkly skin and for speed, his catchphrase is \u201cI am sped.\u201d With a thick winters coat walking in the savanna, he got busted by the BBC, the Ball Busting Committee, for attempted Ball Busting. He was thrown in ball jail and had to bust out of BJ, Ball Jail. After busting out, he went on his journey of busting all the balls in town like as efficiently as a nutcracker.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T07:28:09", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIxMzIwNzAucG5n/original/rjXjLs.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sounides"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
