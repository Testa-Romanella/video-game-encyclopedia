Their support is needed if we want to win this fight: for justice and freedom!

I spend quite a time on the behaviours, so each NPC will need foot, and has a limited amount of money, etc...</p><p>It wasn't enough time to implement everything I thought about though. Also it can happen that you encounter strange situations. Also the balancing could have had some more time. But anyways, I hope everything works out fine.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to SockeMagneti for the wonderful art, I'm sorry that my animation skills are not as good as they could be ;).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing, TreeTimes<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T02:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f95f16dd5a9ad15a6e700e36efdfd80e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TreeTimes"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
