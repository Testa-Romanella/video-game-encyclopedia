Your job as an investigator is to meet and interact with the 9 different characters in the game, and decipher all the information they give you to decide who is the culprit of the murder that took place. The investigator will have to go around the train and interact with their surroundings, talk to the suspects and see if their alibis line up and try to find a hole in their stories. The murder happened in the dead of night, and no struggle was heard; all that you know is that the victim took a bullet to the head. Who could it have been? The janitor? The conductor? The scientist? See if you have what it takes to find out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A and D to move left and right, W to enter or exit rooms, and Tab to open the menu</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>We recommend downloading and playing the build below.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Currently, the game does not contain an end state.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Trouble in Train Town</strong> the team behind Robomotive:</p>\n<p>Sean Callanan Producer</p>\n<p>Ryan Koczalka \u00a0Lead Programmer<br/></p>\n<p>Camden Emery Character Artist</p>\n<p>Jimmy Jiang Environment Artist</p>\n<p>Dominic Prignano Sound and Gameplay Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Jack Dirstine Narrative Designer\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T07:03:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1f/c1ff49f6746856ad8a27eacaac0db568.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TroubleInTrainTown"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
