Featuring a unique, fully physics driven combat engine, GORN combatants will be able to creatively execute their most violent gladiatorial fantasies in virtual reality.

The only limits to the carnage are your imagination and decency, in the most brutal and savage VR face-smashing game ever produced by man.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-31T07:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb5/bb5f9bfe03ce18e22031853298223062.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.88, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 499, "beaten": 28, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 30, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 44, "ratings_count": 56, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 56, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Free Lives"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
