In this scale a worlds first for a game. Due to our technology the evolution in mitosis is real evolution, no creationism or scripted progress.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInvented by world-class scientists.<br/>\r\nlearn about basic principles that drives nature.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExperience the power of chance.<br/>\r\nPlay through the campaign or set up your own experiments.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Mitosis you can become a cell biologist and use different tools to grow a cell population and manipulate its environment. Through manipulation of the environment the conditions of survival change thus the cells have to adapt to their new surrounding. Unlike from similar games you cannot change the cells genome directly but only influence the chances of survival for certain random mutations. This is what evolution is about in reality: Totally random mutation and natural selection.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fe/7fe032971a3c7f4d40db42701d714bb4.jpg", "website": "http://mitosis.5dlab.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["5d Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["5d Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
