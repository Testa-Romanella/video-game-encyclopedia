Maybe you feel they aren't important, maybe you feel the moment isn't right, sometimes you don't have the guts to do it. This is kind of about that.</p><p>I wanted to make a \"slice of life\" game. Just a short conversation, a part of a bigger whole. Like splashing your a bit of my life into a game. There's a graphic novel that I\u00a0love that is full of panels that do that.\u00a0This is rough and well, not sure if entirely successful but that's what I went for. I hope it works on some level at least.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bbdb026b339c179eec5254f9d0f4072.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MiguelCondez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
