This game was a project that was developed in a semester at Folsom Lake College as part of a game development course. There were about ten teams working on games and our team number was 9. For this project we used the Agile Scrum software development methodology using Rally. Each week we focused on different tasks in a sprint and at the start of the new week we either did a scrum meeting or a play test for the game. Based on feedback from the scrum meetings and  play tests, we improved our game each and every time after each sprint.</p>\n<p>Premise:\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are a border security officer that has been tasked with guarding your country from evil robots. Using clues in the dialogue you will determine if someone is either a human or a robot. If it is a human, let them through the border. However, if they are a robot, do not let them through the border. This game is inspired from the games Papers, Please and Snatcher. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to click on buttons to do certain actions. On the main title screen you can interact with three buttons. When you are inside the game, you can interact with the upwards hand button to let a person inside or the downwards hand button to reject them. There will also be questions you can click on on the right-hand side of the screen. Use these questions to figure out if this is a either a human or a robot.<br/></p>\n<p>Developers:</p>\n<p>Joshua Heideman - Programmer</p>\n<p>Lawrence Cachapero - Writer and Project Lead</p>\n<p>Tyler Wells - Programmer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/460/460c5d3607bb0bfa04c8c8de74da9481.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jcheideman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
