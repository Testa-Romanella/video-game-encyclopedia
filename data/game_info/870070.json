You also want to solve global warming, So in this game, you will be solving 2 tasks, Becoming human again and solving global warming. You will have to platform a bunch and solve puzzles to complete each level. Randomly you will be teleported to laboratories, I wonder who even owns them... Find that at the end of the game.\u00a0<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>In Divorian there are 6 levels, And in levels, there are parts (for most of them). I thought to add parts in levels so the game isn't super short because I want the game to be a solid 30 minutes which it should be unless if ur a literal speedrunner.\u00a0 This game has been made with A TON of effort and I would love to see feedback on the game so if you play this game please leave feedback in the comments!\u00a0<br/><br/>Enjoy Divorian!<br/><br/>Divorian has just released a patch!\u00a0<br/></p><p>This patch includes If you vault out of the map u will DIE,\u00a0If you crash DONT WORRY YOUR PROGRESS WILL BE SAVED! Kylox (Final Boss) Health has been lowered to 500 instead of 1000. I also fixed some dialogue messages lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T07:39:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0fb712e6b4fdbda7b4f3353dd2ff659.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mrtreeguy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
