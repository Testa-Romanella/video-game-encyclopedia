And now I need to check the ship engines. Please stop acting like a jerk.\"</em>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\"Never mind my colleague, he's a bit grumpy sometimes.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSo let's continue. The robot woman and her flying companion! I think they build a perfect harmony when they work together. You control the robot with your WASD keys, while you move the flying drone anywhere with your computer mouse. This allows you to move both characters at the same time!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDon't worry about the size of the space station. You'll find your way around the labs and quarters and mining shafts soon enough. And there are teleporters everywhere, you know. Just be cautious about the unstable zone - Tru got lost there for a while and went insane. The docs are keeping silent about it.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAnyway, be sure to equip your bots with upgrades you can find in the shop and scattered through the base. And with time your robot will learn and improve functionality. I think my robot was so happy when I installed the arm-\"\r\n</p><p>\n<em>\r\n\t\"You're still doing it, aren't you? They're just machines! Enough of this, let our new colleague download the files and send him to the station.\"</em>\n</p><p>\r\n\t\"Alright alright. Well, I'm sure you'll have a great time in the Inanna Space Station!
