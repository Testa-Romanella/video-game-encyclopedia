This was the first game I entirely made on my own based on the knowledge I acquired during the previous one and half years. It is only a small game but I put every free minute I had into it. It is not complete or perfect but I think it reached a stage at which it is a playable game and not a prototype anymore. Because I am more of a programmer than an artist the 3D models, sprites, and sounds came from packages I bought in the Unity Asset Store. I hope you have fun playing it :)</p>\n<p>Below follows some information about the game.</p>\n\r\nTechnical\r\n<ul><li>Controls: Controller or Keyboard (no mouse).</li><li>Supported Aspect Ratios: 16:9, 21:9</li><li>Settings: Change Resolution, Change Fullscreen mode, Change Display, Input Mapping, Sound</li></ul>\n\r\nHow To\r\n<p>Destroy the number of asteroids displayed at the top of the screen. If you destroy enough asteroids the end portal is unlocked (an indicator on the screen shows the direction).</p>\n<p>Earn money by destroying asteroids. Different asteroids bring different amounts of money. Pick up the yellow orbs (gold) or the cyan orbs (crystals) to get the money. Crystal orbs are worth more than gold orbs. Upon finishing a level by reaching the end portal, the collected gold/crystals are transferred to your overall money account. All collected orbs are lost if you die before reaching the end portal.</p>\n<p>While playing a bonus time is displayed in the top right corner of the screen. Unlocking and reaching the end portal before the time runs out means you get a bonus on your collected orbs.(up to 100%)<br/>The bonus gradually decreases with the time needed to finish the level.<br/>\u00a0<br/>You can equip weapons before the start of a game. New weapons have to be bought first.<br/>If a weapon is suitable for both weapon slots, buying the weapon in one weapon slot automatically unlocks it in the other weapons slot.<br/>Every weapon is shared across all ships. There are a lot of different weapons, so try the different combinations to find the best one for destroying asteroids :)</p>\n<p>Every ship has either one or two weapon slots. Weapon slots change the fire rate and overall damage of an equipped weapon. Ships have a different acceleration, boost strength, boost count, boost recharge speed, shield, and energy (health) values. Try the different ships to find the best one for you!</p>\n<p>The player level (in the top middle of the screen) shows how hard the next level will be. The player level increases with the total earned money. </p>\n<p>There are night-levels. Asteroids are harder to see but you get 25% more money. </p>\n<p>Currently implemented asteroids: Small, Medium, Large, Obsidian(slow, a lot of health), Crystal(spawns a lot of crystals), Gold (spawns a lot of gold), Push (pushes the player away), Pull (pulls the player toward itself), Explosive (explodes when destroyed), Chase (chases the player), Explosive Chase, Magnetic (like the chase asteroid, but a lot faster), Locking (locks the player's movement).</p>\n<p>Some asteroids spawn smaller asteroids when they are destroyed.</p>\n<p>The game is still a work in progress. Most of the values like ship stats, weapon stats, asteroid health points, how much money is earned at different levels, the costs of most things are not really balanced and are subject to change.<br/>The detailed help is also accessible via pressing 'F1' in the main menu of the game.</p>\n<p>I appreciate every feedback I get.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d750a800bcd3ed9e1cb40b5052edb45a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solo Byte Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
