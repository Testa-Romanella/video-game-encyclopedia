Be the masta of your sabers and your people. Protect yourself and protect them.<h3>Game-play and features</h3>You will appear on an alien spaceship with two energysabers in your hands in deep space somewhere in a faraway galaxy. You can use your energysabers as sabers, shields, or even rail-guns to fight with incoming flying and crawling drones. The drones are coming in waves and you will lose some health every time a drone hits you. The health is restored after each completed wave. In order to complete a wave you need to kill all the drones in it, and each subsequent wave has an increased number of drones. Every drone in a new wave becomes more and more tricky to kill: faster, closer to appear, harder to hit. They can also carry some hidden drones inside and split when you expect that the least.<h3>Physical and mind activities</h3>- 360 arm swings<br/>- 180 body rotation<br/>- Squats<br/>- Dodging lasers<br/>- Precision training<br/>- Attention exercising<br/>- Spaceship walking if you have enough room<h3>Good luck!</h3>It's a VR deep-space experience.<br/>It's a survival game.<h3>Discord</h3>Join our Discord server to share your feedback or get a free early adopter promo code:<br/><br/>https://discord.gg/Q4yEbzw", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T20:19:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/545/54594f6387a92b32f9af830cde99b159.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DreamTeam Mobile"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["DreamTeam Mobile"], "esrb_rating": null}
