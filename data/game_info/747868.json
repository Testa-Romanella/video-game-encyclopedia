Beat your high score by eating delicious plates of food while killing flies with your choice of weapons.</p>\n<p>This is a solo developed student game. I developed it in the course of a month to learn how to do VR games in Unity. All the coding and art assets (except the plants) were done by me, inspired by Studio Ghibli IPs.</p>\n<p>Expect some bugs as this is a very early build.</p>\n<p>To install the Quest 2 version, sideload the .apk through adb or SideQuest. The PCVR version has been tested with an Quest 2 through link mode. If you encounter any problems launching it through other headsets, let me know.\u00a0Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T13:55:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80d90d47dd6e699e3b4957e13b29c75d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Gus"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
