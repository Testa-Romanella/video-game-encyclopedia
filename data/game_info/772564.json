Therefore, he shoots his \"special white liquid\" from his\u2026  yea\u2026 you know it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To maintain Swinging-manhood power, he needs to collect adult magazi... I means \"education material\". This allows him to continuously shoot his \"special white liquid\" and build up his upgrade abilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Beware though! The NEUTER drones are everywhere to stop you. You can destroy them with your swing momentum. The harder you hit them, the more damage drones will take. You won't die, but you will be off the city if you get shot too much.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The city, traffics, and upgrade cards order are randomly generated when you start the game. Not every swing will be the same.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dear Marvel, please don't sue me. I have a wife and a kitten to feed.
