You are tasked with taking down the evil Tyrant, who has resurrected past leaders of the country as merciless robotic super-slaves. Locate the KEY executable - and shut 'em down.</p><p>Beware, though - the robotic army haunts the maze-like interior of Parliament's secret chambers. Incredibly powerful, fast, and ruthless, they will stop at nothing to prevent the assassination of the Tyrant.</p><p>This game is an old-style raycasting FPS in the vein of such classics as Wolfenstein 3D and (who could forget) DOOM. It doesn't need much to run (should run on anything post-millennium) and was achieved using the Raycasting Game Engine.</p><p><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p><ul>\n<li>No DLC!</li><li>No regenerating health!</li><li>Saving/loading system!</li><li>Shoot politicians!</li><li>Relatively cheap!</li></ul><p><strong><em>Currently, there is a SALE on this game - from 5/12/2014 until 6/2/2015, the game is on a \"PAY WHAT YOU WANT\" deal - this means that you can get the game for free, or support the developers by paying for it.
