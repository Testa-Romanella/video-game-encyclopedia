As the night comes you begin to see things in the dark forming from the darkest corners of your intrusive thoughts; eyes that follow you like clockwork, tick-tock, \u2018your time is up\u2019 they chant. Your feet shift nervously, the hair on the back of your neck stands on end, and the eerie blackness surrounds you like a pool of tar. Your heart pounds through the fabric of your shirt and cold sweat snakes down your back. You can\u2019t go on for much longer with this constant paralysis and so your adventure begins; behind the bars of the mental asylum for the (more or less) insane individuals of society. You are inside your room now and inhumane shrieks plague these halls. Get ready, run and survive or die.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T06:01:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fa/6fa842a23ca47efb17ea5163049ecde9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["gamesbyaisha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
