It was inspired by my favourite theme in video games; adventure. In this game you will explore an ancient tomb, and find the secret at the end.</p><p>I made this game because I wanted to make a dungeon that you could explore and feel immersed in. It doesn't feature a whole lot of gameplay but you can light your way and open doors to new areas. I was more concerned in honing my level design skills with this one. I also tried to keep the art consitant, and played around with a few camera effects.</p><p>Controls are as follows:</p><p>Use WASD and Mouse to move and look around</p><p>Space to jump!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66b7376e1bb062a887b32ecabc5779b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MauserPT7"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
