Sagree as his partner in this Film Noir -style narrative adventure game!</strong></p>\n<p>Made in one month for Quick Play 2022 Game Jam. Due to jam's rules, there's only an Android build available.</p>\n<p>The theme for the jam was \"Tradition\". We incorporated this theme in two ways:</p>\n<p>1. We used the traditions of Film Noir, with a heavy-drinking, hard-boiled detective as the protagonist, and a femme fatale, and of course the visual style and music.</p>\n<p>2. We explore the tradition of player-character interactions, where usually the protagonist of a game follows the players commands without question. Sagree is strong-willed, and often outright refuses to do what the player wants. Player will have to coax, pressure, force or manipulate him.</p>\n<p>Made by two Finnish developers:</p>\n<p>Jorava - Game Design, Story, Code, Sound Design, Music\u00a0(Piano Improvisation)<br/>JapeNess\u00a0- 3D-Modelling, Rigging, Animations, Lighting, Music (Arrangement and Production)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T13:39:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65aaed8656fee85ca64d1a3212f531c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Jorava", "JapeNess"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
