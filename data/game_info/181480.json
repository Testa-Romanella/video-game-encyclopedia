The fist screen might look weird on different screen resolutions because I'm lazy, but just press space and you will get to the actual game.</p>\n<p>The game is built on PhaserJS. My code is pretty horrible, so there will most likely be bugs. The physical controller was built using particle board and a lot of hot glue, using a Makey Makey to connect everything.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3a/c3a9c75716c5e8ff3dd1458c5db60804.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["knivdagis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
