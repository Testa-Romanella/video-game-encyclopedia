Here's a game with just one. \u00a0Make sure to use the manual, which you (almost definitely) need to find any of the games three endings. <br/></p>\r\nManual\r\n\r\n<p> (#1CEF01) - A tranquil forest in a restless land. The population lives in fear of the cavebeast, and the inhabitants of the castle do nothing about it.<br/> <br/></p>\n<p> (#00BAA9) - The cave. As you enter, the resident cavebeast is startled by your unexpected appearance so much that it flees into the meadow beyond.<br/></p>\n<p> (#0137F6) - The well. As you look over the side, the rocks crumble and you fall into the water below.<br/></p>\n<p> (#04FE94) - The cave, home of the cavebeast. It sees you within moments, and in just as many moments, you are no more.<br/></p>\n<p> (#06175E) - An aquifer, which opens up into a flooded cavern. You see an unearthly glow coming from around the corner.<br/></p>\n<p> (#256200) - A deeper swamp, impassible without a boat. Before you can turn back, you're up to your thighs in the wet mud. Shortly, you perish.<br/></p>\n<p> (#33ECFF) - Falling from the cliff, you are momentarily engulfed in tender wisps of clouds. This does not last long, and you soon expire.<br/></p>\n<p> (#415B83) - The dock. You pay a local fish-catcher, who gives you a small rowboat in return.<br/></p>\n<p> (#4C0B08) - The armory. The armorer sets to work, and, eventually, hands you a weapon that gives off an unearthly glow. The armorer's eyes are haunted.<br/></p>\n<p> (#643266) - The graveyard, where sit memorials to those taken by the cavebeast.<br/></p>\n<p> (#6AB3EC) - A small hut, empty. You take up residence in a land that now knows peace.<br/></p>\n<p> (#704900) - A wide moat blocking your access to the castle. A heavy drawbridge waits on the other side, but the guards will not lower it for you<br/></p>\n<p> (#7318BF) - The holy halls of the castle. In a thrilling coup, the deposed queen regains control of the land. But where will you live?<br/></p>\n<p> (#808080) - A narrow path, with steep cliffs on either side.<br/></p>\n<p> (#CB01EF) - The holy halls of the castle. The court gives you a hero's welcome for your courageous slaying of the cavebeast.<br/></p>\n<p> (#E17883) - A small hut, with a cookfire out front. Inside is the deposed queen of the land, who you talk into retaking her throne.<br/></p>\n<p> (#ED0177) - The town square. Even though it is a festival day, the mood is subdued and the drummers beat softly.<br/></p>\n<p> (#F5A0FF) - The holy halls of the castle, now empty. The cavebeast has come and gone, off to new lands. You take up residence.<br/></p>\n<p> (#F6FE0D) - A muggy swamp, with tree-hanging moss so thick you can barely move.<br/></p>\n<p> (#FD4D01) - A meadow full of wildflowers. The peaceful scene is only marred by the unearthly glow emanating from the nearby cave.<br/></p>\n<p> (#FEA906) - A wide moat. The heavy drawbridge is down, allowing access to the castle beyond.<br/></p>\n<p> (#FFA97E) - The cave. The cavebeast falls to the glowing sword in your hands, and both unearthly glows flicker out.<br/></p>\n<p> (#FFFFFF) - This color will flash when you have reached an ending of the game.<br/></p>\n<p> (#FE0202) - This color will flash when you have died.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T22:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2e0064d5dfb52ac9119f18467c4fc4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ian Burnette"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
