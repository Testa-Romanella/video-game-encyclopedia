Then continue the input with the starting space followed by a dash \" - \" and the ending space.<br/><br/>An example:<br/></p>\n<p>Sa2-a4\u00a0 \u00a0-&gt; this would move the soldier from a2 to a4</p>\n\n<p>This Chess AI created in C++ uses the MiniMax and Alpha Beta algorithms to predict n-moves into the future and then calculates the optimal move to make by evaluating the moves and board states.</p>\n<p>Currently the AI vs AI mode is not operational but feel free to try the Player vs AI mode or even Player vs Player!</p>\n<p>The depth of the AI is set to 3 and it's using Alpha Beta. The calculated decision tree depth is easily changeable but for now I have set it to three so that the AI will mostly perform its move instantaneously.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:07:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/694/694bcf24fc9fb8e100e268864aa007d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mightysaurus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
