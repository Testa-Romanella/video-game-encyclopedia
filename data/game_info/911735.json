Buy products to sell in your store. The more expensive a product is, the more money it will make. Rack up as much cash as you desire, then transfer that money into your real-life\u00a0bank account.*</p>\n<p><strong>You win after making a million dollars. Post your time in the comments!</strong></p>\n<p>Made for the\u00a0Clicker Jam Winter 2023. I completely missed that there was an additional theme (Interdimensional). So this game doesn't really fit that. Just imagine it takes place in another dimension...<br/></p>\n<p>Note: This is my first time using the Phaser.js Framework, so a lot of time went into figuring out how everything works.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p>Music: \"In Your Arms\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p><em>* This feature will be available in a future updat</em>e</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T07:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/179/179f42eedaa53d26be8745e74c53bd43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["janistch"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
