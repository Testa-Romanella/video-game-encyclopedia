Each object you place creates a sound - you can choose with note it plays. This way you create harmonies in a 3D-environment and move through it. Watch and hear your world grow.<br/>But be careful - if you place a wrong note other fields may loose their harmonies.</p><p>The game has two modes: <br/><br/>- Sandbox mode: Play around and build your own worlds without restrictions <br/>- Online mode: Players are building a world together, but everyone can only place one object. <br/><br/><br/>Controls: <br/>Move (Arrows/WASD) <br/>Cycle through playable keys (M/N) <br/>Rotate View/placable object (Q/E) <br/>Open Menu/Volume Control (ESC) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/199/1992c3b84bca1a10454b311326391774.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Goodwolf Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
