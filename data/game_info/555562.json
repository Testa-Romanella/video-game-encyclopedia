IOS is more complex to reach, so that will be whenever it can be achieved later. But <strong>you can also visit this page on mobile and play already</strong>.<br/>Mobile release will be as seen here, but for a convenient install. Free, no ads added.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n|| CREDITS ||\r\n<p>\n<em>Game Design/Development:</em> Swift Illusion - https://www.midnight-tinkering.com/ | https://twitter.com/Swift_Illusion<br/>\n<em>Game art:</em> PixelBoy - https://pixel-boy.itch.io/<br/>\n<em>Music:</em> \u9f8d\u7684\u4ea4\u97ff\u697d/Dragonic Symphony - http://d-symphony.com\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:04:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/578/578c99922d6f63fd64b76c08a59664fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Swift Illusion"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
