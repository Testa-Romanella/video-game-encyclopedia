I may have not found much gold but look at this big shiny stone! What?! Are you trying to tell me that the stone is cursed and has awoken the ancient magical golems that are now trying to kill us?! WHAT?!\u201c</em></p>\n<p>Spirate is a <strong>co-op top down shooter</strong> that narrates a story of a silly adventuring pirate Captain Goldbeard, who unknowingly <em>\u201cborrowed\u201d</em>\u00a0 an ancient runic stone cursed with an old magic, and forest fox spirit Narahaya who lived on the island in harmony \u2013 until now. Together, you must return the stone to one of the powerful island\u2019s spirits living in their castles on different ends of the island as they might be, perhaps, able to do something about it since they seem to be somewhat connected to the power of the artifact.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You and your friend will cooperate together on pushing the runic stone through the unforgiving jungle full of obstacles and fighting vengeful golems that will try to destroy you for awakening them from their slumber. Unfortunately, the golems have already adapted to the energy of Captain Goldbeard and Narahaya so you must switch your only gun to be able to banish the specific, colour separated enemies \u2013 all that while pushing the stone to stop the chaos as soon as possible.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to<strong> return the cursed stone to a temple</strong>. The runestone glows magically to point out the way. The character holding the gun can <strong>shoot only when standing in shining rune-circle</strong> cast by the other player. The character pushing the stone can\u2019t shoot as they don\u2019t hold the gun, but they should<strong> use this time to push the stone</strong>. To <strong>exchange the gun</strong>, the character that does not wield it can steal it from their partner. Since there are<strong> two colours </strong>of the golems, you will need to work on simultaneously pushing the stone in the indicated direction and getting rid of the two colours of enemies that might overwhelm you.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Narahaya</em>:<br/>Movement: Joystick left<br/>\r\n Aiming: Joystick right\r\n<br/> Shoot: Button\u00a0 RT\r\n<br/> Steal the gun: Button RB\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Captain Goldbeard:<br/></em>Movement: W A S\u00a0D buttons\u00a0<br/>Aiming: Mouse\r\n<br/> Shoot: Left mouse button\r\n<br/> Steal the gun: Right mouse button</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gamejam</strong>\u00a0<strong>Topics:</strong></p>\n<p>Genius Loci: Spirits that guard the temples\u00a0<br/>Runes: Runic island, runic stone\r\n<br/> Zero: Zero progress\r\n<br/> Distance: Shooting</p>\n\n<p><strong>Our team:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Cozy Games Studio et al.</em></p>\n<p><em>Tereza Langov\u00e1 (Langosh)</em><br/>- art and animation<br/>- UI design<br/>- female dragon dubbing</p>\n<p><em>Sofie Kalinov\u00e1 (TenebrisTheFox)</em><br/>- character design<br/>- environment\u00a0art<br/>- spirit dubbing</p>\n<p><em>Jan Kut\u00e1lek (john333)</em><br/>- level design<br/>- programmer</p>\n<p><em>Dan Ju\u0159\u00ed\u010dek (ItsKita)</em><br/>- programmer<br/>- sound designer and music composer</p>\n<p><em>Filip Barva (Barevnej)</em><br/>- programmer<br/>- pirate and male dragon\u00a0dubbing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T10:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10a/10a188d12e84b783dba02ae5ab063b84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ItsKita", "john333j", "Langosh", "Barevnej", "Cozy Games Studio", "TenebrisTheFox"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
