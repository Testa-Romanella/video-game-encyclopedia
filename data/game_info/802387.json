PSLF is GTA reverse. Like lspdfr for gtav .</p>\n<p>Imagine that situation, when you want to player another shorter about gang\u00a0member, pressing play, so far looking good, but instead of became a gang member you become a police officer of NJPD.</p>\n\n<p>Basically it's a fps with some police mehanics. Storyline will tell us a story of a regular police officer, but with a speaker who had to tell the story of a gang member, but nowt had to tell the story of a player who became a police officer due to a \"mistake\" of the developers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sounds good? Awesome but game is still in early stage of development so join my discord server where actually a lot of my work not only this game.
