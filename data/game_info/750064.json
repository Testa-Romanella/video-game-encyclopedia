You will experience the life of the colony from the point of view of an ant, you\u2019ll have various tasks, and you will be able to freely explore the nest and the external environment near it.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player will be able, in the future, to choose the type of ant to control between worker, male and queen, at the moment only the worker ant is implemented. The experience is in first person perspective, and it is guided through missions that make the player live the life of the nest. Once the missions inside the anthill are completed, there will be new missions to be carried out outside. The experience is accompanied by voice overs that explain to the player, along with the missions and interactions with other ants, the life of the nest and the colony. Once the experience is complete, a diary will be available that collects all the information about ants contained within the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is in Italian, but if there is enough interest, we will add a translation.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n<p>The game is to be played with keyboard and mouse\r\n</p>\n<p>W / A / S / D: movements<br/>SPACE BAR: detach from ceiling<br/>E: interact with other ants or larvas<br/>LEFT mouse click: Attack or Drop grabbed object<br/>RIGHT mouse click: Grab object<br/></p>\r\nCreators\r\n<p>The experience is a university project developed by students of the Politecnico di Torino as part of the Virtual Reality course (2021-2022)\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Francesco Bonini\r\n</li><li>Emanuela Favasuli\r\n</li><li>Gianluca Ghione\r\n</li><li>Alessandra Linzalone\r\n</li><li>Daniele Miola\r\n</li></ul>\r\nResources\r\n\r\n<p>Rigged ant model by Ryan_Plyler\u00a0on\u00a0blendswap.com</p>\n<p>Cottage model by gerhald3d\u00a0on\u00a0free3d.com</p>\n<p>Tree model by atrodler\u00a0on\u00a0sketchfab.com</p>\n<p>Garden set models by Prudence on\u00a0sketchfab.com</p>\n<p>White flower model by tojamerlin\u00a0on\u00a0sketchfab.com</p>\n<p>3D model Rose by Stylesharp\u00a0on\u00a0turbosquid.com</p>\n<p>Rose Branch by Lassi Kaukonen\u00a0on\u00a0sketchfab.com</p>\n<p>Yughues Free Stylized Foliages | 3D Vegetation | Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>Flower model by 16874uy\u00a0on\u00a0sketchfab.com</p>\n<p>Tree branch model by oscarherry3d\u00a0on\u00a0sketchfab.com</p>\n<p>Book cover in diary system</p>\n<p>Spider model by: misfit410\u00a0on\u00a0sketchfab</p>\n<p>Mosquito model by: Branislav\u00a0on\u00a0sketchfab</p>\n<p>Dialogue UI by OpenGameArt</p>\n<p>Compass texture<br/></p>\n<p>Warning Icon by \u00a0Warning icons created by Smashicons - Flaticon</p>\n<p>Epic Boss Battle by Juhani Junkala | Music promoted by Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T10:50:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88f/88fa593e34a92c18627d5e7a64782cc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheRegnant"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
