You work for \"Peppy Pest Zappers, Inc.\" Responding to a run-of-the-mill extermination contract for a mysterious warehouse outside of town, you walk into a pitch-dark antechamber. To your consternation, the door shuts behind you and locks.\r\n</p>\n<p>You hear deep, rattling breaths all around you. Labored breaths in; long, weary breaths out. It seems to be coming from the ceiling, the walls, even the floor. \"Hello?\" you call out. \"Anyone there?\" Nothing.\r\n</p>\n<p>A neon sign on the wall facing you suddenly buzzes on. The message reads \"What is this place?\" Your thoughts exactly.\r\n</p>\n<p>By the faint light of the sign, you notice -- to your disgust -- that the ground is ... moving?\r\n</p>\n<p>You come to understand that this may be your most lucrative extermination gig yet. Your fee? Your life.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T11:45:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec6/ec6f842fa114e1e73a616c3123eac89d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mandayen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
