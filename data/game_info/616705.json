Choose your teenage character and run through the spooky graveyard streets in a Halloween theme. Collect coins along the way to unlock the rest of the characters. Use jumps, rolls and dodges to avoid obstacles in the form of hungry zombies, sticking out of the ground hands, cars with open jaws, and warning signs. The longer you run, the higher your speed and the difficulty of oncoming obstacles. Run as far as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T02:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f3b86c2cc07704657dd518f92073c6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuickBobber"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["QuickBobber"], "esrb_rating": null}
