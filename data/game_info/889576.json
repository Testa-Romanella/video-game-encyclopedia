With nobody\u2019s help but your own!\r\n\n<p>Feel free to join us on discord to discuss the experience,\u00a0<strong>every feedback</strong>\u00a0is greatly appreciated!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nWhat is Talk To <em>Me</em>?\r\n<p>Talk To\u00a0<em><strong>Me</strong>\u00a0</em>is a tool that helps you to deal with your life challenges. It can be about life, work, relationships, pets, choice of clothes - you name it. And the best thing? All the answers come from you - no external meddling, nobody judging you, no guru manipulating you. But your own :)\r\n</p>\n<p>During the experience you will speak with an advisor who will listen to your concerns. But the answers of the advisor will not be generated, you will step into the shoes of your advisor and listen to yourself from the advisor\u2019s perspective. After answering to yourself as the advisor, you will switch bodies again to listen to the advisor's answer from your original perspective, and the conversation may continue as long as you'd wish.</p>\r\nCompatibility\r\n<p>This is a Virtual Reality experience that will work on the Oculus Quest 1&amp;2.</p>\r\nBenefits\r\n<p>Thanks to Talk To\u00a0<em><strong>Me</strong></em>, you will be able to experience a conversation with yourself. This is not only fun, but more importantly: it's scientifically researched and shown to help people successfully unpack any issues they might have on their minds.\r\n</p>\n<p>Talk To\u00a0<em><strong>Me</strong></em> helps you to deal with your thoughts and emotions, instead of thinking over and over on challenges without solutions, you can finally deal with those challenges. You\u2019ll be able to identify what\u2019s not working and why.\r\nResearch shows that people typically give better advice to others than to themselves. Talk To\u00a0<em><strong>Me</strong></em> allows you to give advice to yourself like you would to another person. This way you can benefit from the greatest advice possible - from yourself!</p>\n<p>Finally, you will answer to yourself in the position of an experienced advisor, and the simple fact of being someone that looks smart and experienced helps to come up with reflected answers about challenges.
