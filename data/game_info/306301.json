Play the AI, or pass-and-play with a friend!<br/><br/> Tides of Time is a card drafting game for two players that takes place over three rounds. On your turn, choose one card from those in your hand, then pass your hand to your opponent. Each card is one of five suits and a scoring objective. Once all cards have been taken, players calculate their scores based on the cards drafted. Between rounds, you will choose one card to keep for future rounds, and one card to remove from the game. After three rounds the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>This is a long-awaited digital adaptation of the card game from Kristian \u010curla and Portal Games. With this version, you can challenge your friends with pass-and-play or compete against one of the three levels of AI. Unique challenges are also included to keep you on your toes!<br/><br/>Reviews for Tides of Time:<br/><br/> \u201cA great looking two player game that is quick to play and not too heavy on the brain, but with definite scope for strategy.\u201d \u2013 Nick Pitman<br/><br/>\u201cThis game is not complex at all, but it can be a challenge to master. Easily picked up as a filler with non-gamer friends and gamers alike. Highly recommended!\u201d \u2013 Tabletop Together<br/><br/>\u201cTides of Time from Kristian \u010curla is a marvel in minimalist design, creating tons of tension from only eighteen cards in a game that lasts no more than twenty minutes.\u201d \u2013 Eric Martin, Board Game Geek<br/><br/>\u201cThe more I play, the more I enjoy it.\u201d \u2013 Zee Garcia, The Dice Tower<br/><br/>\u201cVery thinky and quiet, but also very interesting. Staying in my collection for sure.\u201d \u2013 Joel Eddy, Drive Thru Review<br/><br/><br/>Featuring:<br/><br/>- Faithful digital adaptation of the Portal Games card game from Kristian \u010curla<br/><br/>- Every card matters in this deceptively simple game<br/><br/>- Local pass-and-play for fun on the go<br/><br/>- Three levels of AI to challenge<br/><br/>- Unique challenges to overcome", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T06:42:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703bdcb7de48ceeec4a17c9c4859b69e_BfwrITc.jpg", "website": "https://portalgamesdigital.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Portal Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Portal Games sp zoo"], "esrb_rating": null}
