I decided to try a re-imagining of an illustrated text-adventure that I released on the ZX Spectrum some years ago.\r\n \r\n</p>\n<p>The game was designed to be an accessible experience, so you can't die or make the game unwinnable. It may be a bit short and on the easier side, but we still hope you enjoy it nonetheless!\r\n </p>\n<p>The game was designed to run on real hardware but works fine on most accurate emulators. We suggest using the BGB emulator if you're running a Windows PC.\r\n </p>\r\nCredits\r\n \r\n<p>Code, Graphics and Design:<br/><strong>snorpung\r\n <br/></strong><br/>Music:<strong><br/>nordloef\r\n </strong></p>\n<p>In-game font \u2019Emmaline\u2019 by DamienG\r\n </p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n \r\n<p>This game is available for free here on itch.io and may <strong><em>not</em></strong> be sold in any form without the explicit permission from the game's authors.\r\n </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T11:24:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ced/ced012aecdf8b91e0fa9e345005c1094.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["snorpung"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
