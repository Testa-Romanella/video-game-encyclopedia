{"id": 883188, "slug": "taco-dragon", "name": "Taco Dragon", "name_original": "Taco Dragon", "description": "<p><strong>Taco Dragon </strong>is based on the conceit that Dragons Love Tacos<strong><em>,</em> as </strong>detailed in the fantastic childrens' books by <strong>Adam Rubin </strong>and <strong>David Salmieri. </strong>I don't want to infringe on the copyright or intellectual property as a whole, but I really enjoy these books as do my sons, Stormy and Rocky (both under the age of 7). <br/></p><p>In this initial iteration of the game, you control a small dragon collecting tacos.</p><p>In future, I intend to add enemies, a story, a big bad, etc., completely different from, but paying homage to, the books. Also intending to smooth out the controls, camera movement, etc. <br/></p><p>\u00a0This is my fourth game (I think), and the current build you see was created in a day (yesterday) which I'll detail more of in my devblog.</p><p><strong><em>CONTROLS:</em><br/></strong></p><p><strong>Mouse controls the camera</strong></p><p><strong>Left+click - shoot fireball</strong></p><p><strong>Right+click - breathe fire</strong></p><p><strong>W - forward<br/></strong></p><p><strong>S - backward<br/></strong></p><p><strong>A - left<br/></strong></p><p><strong>D - right<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Spacebar - jump / gain altitude</strong></p><p><strong>Q - take flight</strong><strong> / leave flight<br/></strong></p><p><strong>F - pay respects</strong><br/></p><p>This is most definitely a pre-alpha, rough draft  build of a game.\u00a0</p><p>It has a title screen, gameplay, a pause screen with options to resume, return to title, or quit outright, music, and some minimal sound effects.</p><p>I used premade assets extensively as I consider myself by far more of a designer/writer than coder. I'll go into detail about how they're used in my devblog, but for reference, here's a list of everything you see on-screen with affiliate links so you can check them out (plus, a lot of them are on sale for Black Friday right now!):<br/></p><p>Synty Nature Biome<br/>https://prf.hn/l/jWNEQWJ</p>\n<p>Malbers Animal Controller<br/>https://prf.hn/l/q54ARbe</p>\n<p>Malbers Dragon<br/>https://prf.hn/l/QxRnlwE</p>\n<p>Fantasy Map Creator<br/>https://prf.hn/l/413Ae1a</p>\n<p>FREE Casual Food Pack<br/>https://prf.hn/l/b3QYR3m</p>\n<p>Game Music Treasury Vol. 1<br/>https://prf.hn/l/dl2QNlq</p>\n<p>Prefab Brush +<br/>https://prf.hn/l/WJgnXyk</p>\n<p>Playmaker<br/>https://prf.hn/l/20PjBOO</p>\n<p>Polygon Arsenal<br/>https://prf.hn/l/RmRqPgJ</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T06:55:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a5/0a5f56555b1d9b3233dac437716e629a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["phazonxiii"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
