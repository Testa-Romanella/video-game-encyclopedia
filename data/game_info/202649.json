The idea was to solve the problem of \"chaotic button mashing\" that happens in most space shooter/shoot-em-up games in which the player has no incentive to not shoot as fast as possible. The rhythm system isn't perfect, unfortunately, but you can tell if you're \"on beat\" by getting the faster, more powerful, red lasers. Four on beat shots in a row gets you a triple shot. </p><p>We might return to this idea sometime. I think the concept of applying the \"Crypt of the Necrodancer\" formula to other genres holds promise.</p><p>James Vargas-Witherell: Music, Project Management</p><p>Tegan Valo/Kyle Sammons/Nicholas Jamison: Coding, Design</p><p>Garrett Hour: Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/231/231d6798a61c477b4144f11de6a24baa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tegan Valo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
