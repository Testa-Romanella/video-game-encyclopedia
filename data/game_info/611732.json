In 8-Ball, there are two opposing sets of 7 balls and one black ball (the 8-Ball). Of the 15 balls on the table (not counting the cue ball) the first 7 balls, which are numbered 1-7, are solid in color, while the remaining 7 balls, numbered 9-15, are stripped. One player makes all of his 7 balls, followed by the 8-Ball, at which point he is declared the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Unlike 8-ball, 9 ball uses only 9-ball, and the cue ball includes all of the solid colored ball and the striped 9-ball. In 9-ball, players must shoot at the balls in numerical order, starting with the 1-ball and continuing until all 9 balls have been sunk. Mostly, the game of 9-ball can be ended soon if it calls \u201ccombination shot\u201d, in which a player hits the next ball in order - \"say the 3-ball\" - into the 9-ball and pots 9-ball the hole.<br/><br/>Follow us and regularly update event on the fan page:<br/>\u25fd Fanpage: https://www.facebook.com/8balllegendgame<br/>\u25fd Inbox: http://m.me/8balllegendgame", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T04:31:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aad/aad377bd7463c3189a099857768e506d_cHSav5P.jpg", "website": "https://onetapstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Onetap"], "genres": ["Sports", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["ONETAP VIET NAM TECHNOLOGY COMPANY"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
