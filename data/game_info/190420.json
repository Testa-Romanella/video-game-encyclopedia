We looked at<br/>everything that other game makers make in the strategies - we did not<br/>really like anything, and we eventually made an excellent game<br/>ourselves). The game will suit fans of turn-based strategies with<br/>battles in the spirit of the \"Heroes of Might and Magic\", as well as<br/>to all lovers of economic strategies with battles. The game is called<br/>\"Casual Heroes\".<br/><br/>In our game there are not all these long-bored non-existent knights,<br/>dragons and goblins, but there are real grannies with slingshots,<br/>firefighters with axes and electricians with bare wires.<br/></p>\n<p>Ordinary people have got up on the warpath in the battle for resources<br/>and survival after global disaster! As in any good strategy, in the<br/>game there is a base on the island which needs to be developed. Our<br/>players can joined in clans to chat, help each other and to<br/>participate in tournaments.<br/></p>\n<p>Google Play https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.ru.vigr.heroes<br/>App Store https://itunes.apple.com/app/casual-heroes/id1297648650?ls=1&amp;mt=8</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e5/7e546806d2945d0e60b565b4e541fe55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pincoder"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
