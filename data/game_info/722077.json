Overall though, I'm pretty proud of the end result (especially game design wise). Ultimately, this game is the exploration of 2 very simple (but deep) mechanics and on that note the game delivers exactly what I wanted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:26:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/956/95619d0b56807b5b37f1ce130959dbe5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eric_Fulla"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
