After 10PM, when everyone is home, the virus attacks and someone must protect the faculty, and that\u2019s where you come in. You gotta survive 9 increasingly difficult waves of enemies from 10PM to 7AM. To make your life easier, a shop is open in between each round where you can buy items and lots of weapons to power up your character. In two special waves, the bosses Novaxx and XYN4 will make an appearance, and you will need to use all your arsenal and skill to keep up with them.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>You are able to dash in 8 directions. By dashing you can access harder places, move faster and dodge enemy attacks. You can only dash once each time you are in the air. You can also dash diagonally into the ground and keep your dash momentum forwards</p>\n<p>Each enemy will get staggered when they reach a certain life percentage. When they are staggered they are unable to move or shoot for a few seconds. If you dash through an enemy while they are staggered, the enemy will be executed, the dash will be reset ( you will be able to dash again ) and you will be healed. By resetting your dash, you will be able to reach areas with alternative paths.</p>\n\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25cf WASD - Moving (the dash direction is the direction you are holding)</p>\n<p>\u25cf I or SPACE- Jump\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25cf J - Dash\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25cf L - Shoot weapon\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25cf Numbers - Switch to weapon\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25cf K - Buy item, Start wave\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25cf ESC - Pause Menu\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25cf R - Reload shop ($GME mode only)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T07:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/930/93041d6727e9cd448a67e2a7cbfe9ced.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vextoff"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
