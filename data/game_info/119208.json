I hope this will help more\u00a0caregivers with teaching their young ones how to spell their names. Young players that play this game will also be exposed to the sound that each letter makes, hopefully making it easier for young players to learn the alphabet.</p>\n\n\n\r\nWhat do I have to do in this game?\r\n<p>In this game young players are on a mission to spell words by\u00a0gathering cubes that have different\u00a0letters on them. Completing all the words will help their new friend get back into space where his mum and dad wait. Players will hear sounds associated with\u00a0the letter as well as see visual representation of the letter hopefully making learning the alphabet a lot easier for our young ones.</p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\nKEYBOARD\r\n<p><strong>W</strong> = MOVE FORWARD</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>=MOVE LEFT</p>\n<p><strong>S</strong>=MOVE BACK</p>\n<p><strong>D</strong>=MOVE RIGHT</p>\r\nMOUSE\r\n<p><strong>LEFT CLICK</strong> = PICK UP BLOCK / PUT DOWN BLOCK</p>\n<p>*BREAK OBJECTS<strong>(WHILE IN ARM TOOL MODE)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RIGHT CLICK</strong> = CHANGE TO ARM TOOL / CHANGE BACK TO PICK UP BLOCKS</p>\n<p>*CLICK TO CHANGE BETWEEN FUNCTIONS</p>\n\n\r\nCREATORS -\u00a0MSio,\u00a0Skatus12", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d22/d228fbac2e183cc369bf240b23579b6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MSio"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
