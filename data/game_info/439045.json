The\u00a0art\u00a0was provided as\u00a0part of the\u00a0jam\u00a0(the\u00a0only art\u00a0allowed\u00a0in the game,\u00a0in fact). I went with a shoot-em since the sprite sheet had some sprites that looked alien-y, plus the non-overlap and grid based limitation according to the rules of the jam made it easier to go with a shoot-em up approach. All the movements are in 8x8 grid too.</p>\n<p>Please note the game resolution is 256x192 (nod to the ZX Spectrum ), so the game is best played at full screen, where it will be scaled up correctly - unless you prefer playing it in a tiny pocket of space on your HD screen!<br/></p>\n<p>Had fun working on this as this is my only second game for a game-jam. I'm still learning the art of working within limitations and time constraints so the game is quite simplistic admittedly. Nevertheless, hopefully you'll have some fun playing it!<br/></p><p>All code and sound fx by me.</p><p><strong>Music source</strong>Pocketmaster - Ride : https://freemusicarchive.org<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:48:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77a/77abc0f7b4c22b599f13d81ac8ff521f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["KnightOrc"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
