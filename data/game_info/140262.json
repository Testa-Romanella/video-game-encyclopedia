She had him since she was a child. <br/>We spent most of our time at her home playing with him, sleeping with him, talking about him, making photos of him and sending them to each other through social media. My girlfriend loves drawing and she draws our dog a lot.\u00a0Here's her dA profile.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm amazingly shit at drawing and making songs, but I can program.\u00a0So that's how <em>chickory adventures </em>came about - I used Bitsy to portray where could our doggo go and what could he do during a typical day when he was home alone. It's an awesome tool, giving you just enough to tell what you want to tell, so kudos to @adamledoux!\u00a0</p><p>Update 25.05.18:\u00a0Cykor is in a better place now. <br/>There won't be a dog like you anymore. We love you. This game is for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/3994e7cf9108868c5ccb373d11a19b57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Savage//Noble"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
