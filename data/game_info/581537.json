You finally got that Little Red \"Hot Hatch\" Hatchback turbo you always wanted. Time to take it on the freeway and open it up to see what it can do. Don't crash into any other cars though, you only have one life. The person who had the car before you says it's pretty quick, but it gets a little \"squirrely\" at top speed.\r\nUse the fire button as the accelerator as you maneuver your car around the other cars on the freeway. Pushing down on the joystick will hit your brakes. Feel free to mosey along with traffic, but this is a racing game and no point are awarded unless you're going faster than all the other cars on the road.\r\nThis game is has been entered in the\u00a0The C64 'Cassette 50' Charity Competition.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T14:48:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/696/6960c9073bac8fb625992f6e2c7cf428.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MikeC"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
