The theme was 'Fairy tales retold'.<br/><br/>I was teaching myself Twine as well as creating my first piece of interactive fiction, and had just a weekend in which to do it. Found it helped my writing block as I didn't have time to worry about whether it was good or not. Strangely liberating, and good fun.</p>\n<p>I had this 'wonderful' idea about the various stories that would be retold from the viewpoint of my main character, once established in the prologue. Each story would be a chapter. Problem? I had branch explosion, didn't even get beyond the prologue. To pull each prologue ending in to a usable number I'd have to create a lot of sudden ends - which would annoy me as a player. Hey ho!</p>\n<p>So - I learned a ton, had fun - but never heard what people thought of it. I think I've enough distance now to accept 'my god it's terrible'. I've since entered the games industry, and hopefully learned a lot since. It goes against *all* the in-house rules at the current company.  <br/><br/>Still kinda fond of my first flailings, though. Might one day see if there's anything worth salvaging. I'd edit a lot of words out now, for sure...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b97/b97e6b4abfb1fa9e0d3fb6cff625fbdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BabelFishWars"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
