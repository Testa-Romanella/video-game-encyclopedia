The theme of the jam was <strong>\"It's okay to fail\"</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Robolution is about a robot who loses parts when it moves around. The player should collect parts from other robots in order to keep the robot alive and moving. Every time the player dies, there will be a tombstone with a parts item which will give the player some more health in the next run thus helping them stay alive for longer. These tombstones can also be used as shield to block enemy attacks.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0The original idea had more weapons and multipliers on combo kills for better weapons. But this is a prototype showcasing the basic features to which there could be a lot more added. I didn't have time to code in the longest time survived and farthest distance travelled from all the runs;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Click to move the player around. There are bursts of bullets every second and the player must time his attacks and retreats and manage to stay alive by collecting the health dropped by killing enemies and previous run tombstones.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CODE:\u00a0https://github.com/shubhgawhade/AGDS-Game-Jam</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T06:04:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/074/074d22db05e607e0d114d51765268f48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shubhgawhade"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
