Armed with the finest warriors, the kingdom aims to make Stamplands another one of its conquests. They mark their intentions as just, claiming the territory houses savage, vicious monsters, yet none can confirm the validity of the claim. With another attack incoming, it\u2019s up to you to help your fellow ink creatures defend themselves against the Eraser Kingdom, and survive another day.<br/></p>\n<p>\n<em>Siege of Stamplands</em> is a tower defense game made for the Game Off 2022 with the theme \"clich\u00e9\".<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the left click mouse button to\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Click and drag metal clich\u00e9s that can be used to create stamps on the map.\r\n</li><li>Click the tiles and gain more information about the stamps you placed there.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Use the right click mouse button to deselect the clich\u00e9s if you don\u2019t want to use them any more.\r\n</p>\n\r\nInterpreting Clich\u00e9\r\n<p>Our main interpretation of the theme is based on the world of printing. In printing, clich\u00e9s can refer to \u201cthe carrier of the print motif, which is transferred to the object by the pad\u201d. This concept of clich\u00e9s inspired many of our systems, including a deck of clich\u00e9s, ink as a resource, and stamping as our main player action.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Clich\u00e9s can also be \u201ca phrase or opinion that is overused and betrays a lack of original thought\u201d. We included this more traditional interpretation of clich\u00e9, but added a twist. We took the clich\u00e9 of the \u201cgood guys\u201d fighting against evil monsters and protecting their home. However, we presented a different perspective: that of the \u201cmonsters\u201d. Not to mention, what\u2019s more clich\u00e9 than an indie team making a card-based game? x3</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><em>Siege of Stamplands</em> is brought to you by Team OnionStamps from @supkalgames.\r\n</p>\n\r\n Collin Anderson\u00a0(Instagram)Sound Designer, Audio ImplementerRob TunstallComposerVictor ZhouGameplay Programmer, DesignerKalpercioDesigner, Gameplay Programmer, VFX ArtistConallDesignerSupriseOrbProducer, Technical Artist, UI ProgrammerChaofan YuGraphic / UI DesignerBreakerHaleConcept/Environment/Prop Artist, AnimatorPaula Guerrero (Twitter)Concept/Character Artist, Animator, MarketingVananeSocial Media Manager", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T11:45:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d39/d39ef5fbc0e0a17d3455c3666b41ce47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["SupriseOrb", "Victor Zhou", "Kalpercio", "BreakerHale", "robtunstall", "canderson819", "Conall Barrett", "Chifle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
