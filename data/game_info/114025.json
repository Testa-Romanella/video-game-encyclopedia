Once you get the hang of it, try to collect all three Crystals, and skip all the checkpoints possible to achieve a perfect game!</p><p>Like the game? Let me know by sharing it and getting more people to download it! If there is enough interest in the game, I will improve and expand the world into a full-fledged frustrating-as-heck platformer!</p><p>Questions/Comments? Just wanna say hi?
