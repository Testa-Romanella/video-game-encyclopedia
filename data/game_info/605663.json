Everything starts inconspicuously. Exactly as if you have just started another boring shift at work. But you see that something is going on..<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Everything looks a little different here. Prisoners are disgusting swines who will do anything to humiliate you. They're starting to rule here. You want to show them where they belong? It won't be easy at all.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>For months of humiliation, execution and other stupid ideas, they will finally say \"enough\". Maybe today, maybe next month. Who knows? One thing is certain. Only you will stay in this shit. Yes, you. You're alone. It's up to you whether these reptiles go back to prison or you get out of this jail in a black bag.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Have you ever seen real fights? Fire everywhere? Prisoners destroying the whole prison? Or maybe your super-amazing coworker lost his keys a few days ago?<br/>Those will be funny days in this facility. For you, for sure.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Gameplay description</h3><br/>Prologue contains:<br/><br/>\u2666 New events<br/>\u2666 New dialogues<br/>\u2666 New routines<br/>\u2666 Redesigned environment<br/>\u2666 New soundtrack and sound effects<br/>\u2666 New models and items<br/>\u2666 Weapon mechanics and shooting<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You always wanted to shoot? Did you dream about weapons at night? Great. Grab a gun, because without it you can catch a ride into the afterlife. But if you think you're a fighter, you don't have to use it. Take your nightstick and go! Maybe you will get something special? Maybe.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Take part in negotiations, or at least try it. Maybe you can do it. Benches are burning in the yard, there is a battle for tables in the canteen and the workshop turns into a slaughterhouse. So what will you do now? Fight. You are a guard. You rule here. They're only convicts, they're sitting for murder, rape and theft.
