Explore a small interconnected world and generate a dynamic document of your journey!</p>\n<p>This game is intended as a low-stakes experience, taking inspiration from the Lenormand divination card deck and written with positive grounding moments in mind. Even if you're not interested in the poetics part, I hope that this world lets you spend some time actively engaging with a calm space.\u00a0 It has no designated end, so you are welcome to come and go as you please. Progress is not saved, however.<br/></p>\n<p>An Animate Oracle is played entirely using the keyboard of your computer. Use the arrow keys (or W, A, S, and D) to navigate the menu and the world. Interact with entities with the \"ENTER\" key. Pause using the \"ESCAPE\" key. Unfortunately, the mouse, trackpad, and touchscreen are not compatible with this game.<br/></p>\n<p>I would also like to note that I am still a novice in every aspect of this game. If you experience any errors or bugs, please let me know!<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created in the Godot game engine as part of an independent study project on the applications of interactivity in poetics.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T13:21:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e1/3e146ffad517ef4e60c07d5b6bee3719.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ichor and Honey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
