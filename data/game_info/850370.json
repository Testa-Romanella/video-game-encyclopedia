For that, I made a very simple Rube Goldberg Machine that aloud me to focus on the different ways all the objects can move around each other with different settings. The version I uploaded was simply one of the more logical renditions of the machine with all the mass and gravity settings, although I think the sneak attack on the pink cylinder\u00a0from the purple sphere on the right is quite interesting regardless.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T11:10:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f2/4f288815f8350b4610c56599ed208db9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["oam114"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
