You\u2019re lost, or so everyone says. After losing everything you cared about in your life, you wake up from a nightmare and decide you can\u2019t live like this anymore. Even though you aren\u2019t convinced you\u2019ll find yourself at first, you keep pushing. Will you ever find that soul that used to fill you at the end of the journey? Or is it going to be a meaningless waste of time? There\u2019s only one way of finding out: trying. And you\u2019re just determined enough to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Music by RockWizard</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T09:07:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cce/cce9ed3d3871f82e724937d8e0c22e5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HawKyre"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
