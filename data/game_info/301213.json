{"id": 301213, "slug": "yukorikka", "name": "Yukorikka", "name_original": "Yukorikka", "description": "<p><em>On the far-off world of Yukorikka, the docile Yuk-Beetle roams. A primitive species, the Yuk-Beetle seeks only food and warmth. And each year, as winter draws in, the beetles migrate southwards towards the great Okorikka River\u00a0in search of just that.\u00a0</em><em>Enter Chuck, a young Yuk-Beetle who finds himself separated\u00a0from the rest of his flock. Your goal is simple: Help Chuck finish the annual Yuk-Beetle migration, and reach his family on the banks of the Okorikka River.</em></p>\n<p><em>Yukorikka </em>initially started out as part of a small university project, with the key mechanic of the game being the player's ability to change colour in order to navigate certain obstacles.\u00a0Recently, I decided to revisit the concept, with the intention of fleshing it out into a full-fledged game. In the future, I will be updating the game with new levels and new mechanics. Please enjoy, and if you do, consider making a small donation.
