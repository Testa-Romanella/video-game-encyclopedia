When you switch away from a track, a computer racer takes over driving on that track for you.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the AI racers aren\u2019t very competent. In other words, to place well in every track you're racing on, you\u2019re going to have to hop track-to-track on a regular basis to account for the subversively cretinous computer cars.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s just some of the many reasons you'll love Drive!Drive!Drive!:<br/><br/>\u2022 Online multiplayer<br/>\u2022 Create your own tracks and share them online<br/>\u2022 Four different gameplay modes: purist mode, arcade mode, collection mode, and time trial<br/>\u2022 A campaign mode featuring 50 tracks<br/>\u2022 A bonus campaign mode featuring 50 additional tracks<br/>\u2022 An amazing soundtrack by synth/prog/post-rock band ZOMBI<br/>\u2022 Ten unique environments<br/><br/>1 player<br/>Network Players 2-4<br/>450MB minimum save size<br/>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
