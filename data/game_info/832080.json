{"id": 832080, "slug": "photocopier-explosion", "name": "Photocopier Explosion", "name_original": "Photocopier Explosion", "description": "<p>Photocopier Explosion is an ancient Construct 2 game about a photocopier that explodes because of evil bad art and you gotta recover the 5 missing gears. Or something.<br/><br/>It was made for a game design class in middle school. I think I aced the assignment.<br/>Here it is in its glory, except I replaced the music with music that I made because the original game used music from some sound pack I don't remember or know of, and I don't wanna get impaled by copyright for using music I don't know the creators of!<br/><br/>There's probably a bunch of bugs from compiling this game in the latest version of Construct 2. I don't know which version of Construct 2 this game was originally compiled in but I know it was pretty old. I think there's a bug with the lives counter but I'm not too keen on fixing up an game from middle school for any longer with a programming language I mostly forgot.<br/><br/>Most of the music comes from some of my old projects that didn't work out too well. The music will be uploaded on Youtube soon if I don't forget about it while I'm working on my far superior game Valleyway.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T07:56:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7d/b7d3f3e69a2ecc0b072187685c18b0af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bl0x"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
