The theme was \"Waves\". We thought of a character waving at people on the street, and ended up with this idea. The Global Game Jam is not a competition, but we won the Best Visuals Award in our local jam site, GranadaJam, yaaay! :-D\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tMeet the Bahamut Team\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe were a team of 6 people. Some of us knew each other before the jam, but we first met the others just before starting it. We decided that our team was going to be called <strong>Bahamut Team</strong>. Meet the team members, from left to right in the photo:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Adri Portillo</strong> (programming)</li>\n<li><strong>Elior \"Vanilino 6\" Dumont</strong> (music, sound FX)</li>\n<li><strong>Valerio Sevilla</strong> (programming)</li>\n<li><strong>Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez</strong> (graphic design)</li>\n<li><strong>Beatriz Bustamante</strong> (graphic design)</li>\n<li><strong>Alejandro Molina</strong> (programming)</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tThe game design was performed by the whole team :-)\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Additional comments</strong>\n</p><p>\nThe game had some limitations and issues when released for the GlobalGameJam. Some improvements and fixes have been made afterwards, but it is still a bit buggy. Anyway, we hope you enjoy giving it a try!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can download both the original version and the latest one from this page.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Related link</strong><strong>s</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Global Game Jam 2017 entry</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3b/d3bde3f231d9ec909c9064efbe9dbb21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Valerio Sevilla"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
