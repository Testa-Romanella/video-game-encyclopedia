As a werewolf, Talon has the unique ability to collect <em>wild berries</em>, and fortunately, most of her friends use the things like currency. </p>\n<p>Time to go collect the ingredients for a curse cure-all! </p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>LEFT/RIGHT - Move!</p>\n<p>UP - Jump!</p>\n<p>DOWN - Interact!</p>\n<p>SPACEBAR - Howl!</p>\n<p>ENTER - Confirm entry (on start screens and such)</p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.0 release notes (GBJam 5 has ended):</strong></p>\n<p>Well! Managed to get the game in under the wire, but currently we're missing a little bit of content.  For the purposes of the game jam, the game must stay as is (I believe?) until the voting has completed. </p>\n<p>Please bear with me, I will be releasing a V 1.1 with (hopefully) all remaining issues corrected (particularly the fact that the ending is currently impossible to access). </p>\n<p>It's been a blast working on this, and I'm taking a really quick breather before I start work on Yuri Game Jam. I hope folks will try this game out and enjoy themselves!</p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.1 release notes (POST-GBJam 5): (No longer available for download, see below!)</strong></p>\n<p>Now attempting to include an HTML5 version of the game, but having some trouble getting Itch.io to display it on the game page. If it doesn't work in that sense, I will wait till post-Jam voting time to fix it. (This update is not meant to reflect work done during the GB Game Jam, but post-Jam polish and fixes)!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Changes to this version of the game:</strong></em></p>\n<p>-Tutorial level is now implemented (may get some tweaks)</p>\n<p>-All music is now in the game!</p>\n<p>-All levels have a barebones layout that is actually playable now (if not their final layout and art assets)</p>\n<p>-Going in and out of rooms should be much more logical than in the GBJam release / feel better for gameplay</p>\n<p>-Game still doesn't seem to properly trigger finish conditions, but everything else seems to work</p>\n<p>-Cleaned up the 'Crossroads' where players choose between levels.</p>\n<p>Known Issues:</p>\n<p>-Tile 'tearing' in some levels (working to fix with next update)</p>\n<p>-Sometimes exits to rooms inexplicably stop working and the room will not let you leave. Repeated attempts might work, but they might not-- until I can figure out what causes this issue, I'm not sure how to fix it.</p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.2 Release Notes (10/15/2016; Final Release):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Players can now collect berries without having to press down. Just howl and touch the berries before they close again!</p>\n<p>-UI now reflects game progress; ending triggers properly</p>\n<p>-Room transitions completely fixed</p>\n<p>-Tile tearing should be fixed; please let me know if you experience it!</p>\n<p>-Soundtrack can now be downloaded. :)</p>\n<p>Please enjoy the final release of the game! Thank you so much. After voting for GBJam is over I'll make the final release available as a Windows download as well, since some animations do not trigger properly in HTML5! </p>\n<p><strong>EDIT: </strong>V1.2 Windows (.exe) version has been released as well! I would recommend this version. :) The 1.0 version has been taken down.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> HTML5 Version has a mysterious error that crashes the game if you get a game over! So until I'm able to figure out what's causing this issue, I am taking down the HTML5 to try to ensure the best possible player experience.
