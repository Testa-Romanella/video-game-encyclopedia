The aim is simple, make it to the end of the level and jump into the next one. The game has save states so if you are stuck feel free to leave and come back to it. These trails are fairly challenging, and the game is fairly buggy (I am a lone developer with school work) so please take it with a grain of salt.</p>\n\n<p>Shoot - Left click or Gamepad Right Trigger</p>\n<p>Move - WASD or Gamepad Left Stick</p>\n<p>Change weapon - Mouse Wheel or Gamepad DPAD UP or DOWN</p>\n<p>Interact - E or Gamepad Left Face Button</p>\n<p>Pause - Esc or Gamepad Menu Button</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:49:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdd/bdd8b97b9c2329b915d3cd24342d5cb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CorrosiveKiller"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
