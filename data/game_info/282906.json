A light-hearted and playful puzzle game about working together.<br/><br/>Play alone controlling both characters or share the experience with a friend. Bleep Bloop is extremely easy to learn, but that doesn't mean the puzzles will be a piece of cake.<br/><br/>- Enough levels to keep you entertained during a lazy Sunday, but not enough to make you wish the game had ended already.<br/><br/>- Beautiful soundtrack that makes getting stuck on a level a bit less painful.<br/><br/>- Perfect for single-player or two-player coop. Yelling at each other doesn't improve your puzzle-solving skills, but it's always fun.<br/><br/>- Features a small secret hidden somewhere. Go look for it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T01:47:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/302/302c3e66a62e13dc76c16f8d61121c8e.jpg", "website": "http://zerounogames.com/gamepublishing/bleep-bloop/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Ludipe & Friends"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zerouno Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
