It is the first part of the tetralogy, followed by the three sequels and one remaster. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game consists of two modes: survival and racing. The goal of the racing part is pretty much the same as in any game of its genre: to reach the finish through the variety of lap tracks. The one to finish the route first wins. There are always eight players on the map with the protagonist and seven other racers \u2014 the game does not divide players into teams, every racer plays for himself.  While the survival mode brings a new experience to the genre cause the winning player is determined not only by the amount of the damage it dealt to the others but also by surviving as long as possible. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The FlatOut is usually noticed for the realistic physics and the destruction mechanics, allowing the player to ruin their cars in many ways with the different types of collisions being caused by the different kinds of accidents accordingly. Apart from vehicle impacts the racing game also features realistic driver-tossing-out mechanics based on Ragdoll physics technology, which was previously used in animated cartoons and FlatOut is the first known title to utilize the engine in the video games.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2004-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T18:44:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b39/b39e0b98ac821bbc630948054b4e5041.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.04, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 77, "owned": 1573, "beaten": 320, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 142, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 372, "suggestions_count": 421, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 374, "platforms": ["Xbox", "PlayStation 2", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Bugbear Entertainment"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Strategy First", "Empire Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
