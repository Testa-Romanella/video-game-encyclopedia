The bee\u2019s secret weapon is its honey hook, which allows it to grab items or weapons to progress through the hive, grab the queen and fly away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our core gameplay revolves around avoiding collisions with walls, traps, projectiles and enemies on your way in, but also being careful of not hurting the queen on your way out, as it\u2019s more challenging as she\u2019s swinging from your hook!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Features:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>8 levels with increasing difficulty</li><li>Honey hook allowing the player to grab different tools and the queen\r\n</li><li>Gate system requiring the player to bring a heavy mech-honeycomb on a pressure plate to activate it\r\n</li><li>Spiders blocking the way walking across the passages\r\n</li><li>Spiders shooting towards the player\r\n</li><li>Laser traps triggering every few seconds\r\n</li><li>Fireball dispenser providing the player a weapon to hook and clear a path\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T16:01:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05c/05c91aff7f4dc80d8bbbdc46b3fcee51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NedRichard"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
