In order to spice things up, seaguls are lerking predators above the coastline. Hide from them or run when they dive for the kill!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Armin Theisz\u00a0 - Code\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ruben Horn - Code</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Joel Laqua - 3D Art&amp; Tech Art</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anastasia Pomelova - Code and 2D Art</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Litha Bacchi - 3D Art</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T04:40:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/363eac26816e5f26a574415efebbd582.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Esdreika"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
