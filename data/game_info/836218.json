Why don't you have fun with our collection of normal summer activities, such as smore roasting, swimming,\u00a0 or stacking ice cream (yes that's all I had time to make sorry). Have fun, relax, and gain tokens to redeem for decorations, achievements, and bragging rights. </p>\n\r\nHow Do I Play?\r\n<p>Download by scrolling down. I guess. No web version..</p>\n\r\nWhere Content?\r\n<p>Content? Oh yeah there is content in the SUPER COOL DOWNLOADED VERSION but you know I'm not advertising it. In the SUPER COOL DOWNLOADED VERSION you can get cool secrets like a challenge thing\u00a0and other stuff. This game will get you 30 minutes (most likely) to 3 hours of fun times. This game was made using my own sweat and tears. Also, I decided to not make a WEB version because I'm running out of sanity.</p>\n\n<p>Game made in about a bit shy of 35 hours considering vacations, family stuff, and classes.\u00a0 Worked one hour a day (on days i could work on it). So, uh, yeah.
