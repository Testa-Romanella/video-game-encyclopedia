The best thing about those early flight sims was the up-close dog-fighting with guns, so I've tried to capture that feeling here.  </p>\n<p>There is no auto-aim, there are no missiles, just pure dog-fighting skill over procedurally generated landscapes, with procedurally generated missions.</p>\n<p>Set across three different time-periods, you'll fight bad guys using biplanes, jet fighters, and futuristic spacecraft, each with a very different feel.  </p>\n<p>Controls are keyboard or joypad (tested using the PS4 dualshock 4 pad).  I recommend using a joypad for the most enjoyable experience but the keyboard works just fine. (note: there are no mouse controls and this is a deliberate design decision, so please bear that in mind)</p>\n<p>Critical Alpha was a collaborative project, developed in the Gamkedo club.  Check it out for loads more free games developed by folks collaborating from all over the world.</p>\n<p>Please note that the terrain has been updated to a low-poly, flat shaded style since the trailer was created. The screenshots are a better representation of the actual in-game visuals.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d29/d2942e9c8395596014493b76a6a6bc2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Stone Baked Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
