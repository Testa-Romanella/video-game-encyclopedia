Summery</strong></p>\n<p>I think this assignment is mainly about how to implement Camera to the Engine. And how to move your objects and camera view as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think I have a better understanding about reference by fixed the bug I had when changing the shape of the object. And I changed my structure again. I created the object class, including geo, effect, rigid-body. So now\u00a0instead of\u00a0submit effect and geo separately,\u00a0 I\u00a0submit the object to Graphics to render. I think this is a better design for user to use.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>2.
