This is a new story that will re-introduce some of the old points from the first TLOTT story, like you're\u00a0 just hearing of it for the first time. More new Pok\u00e9mon have started make an appearance in the region along with even more new Transgene Pok\u00e9mon discovered by Professor Ray, Dynamax Dens have now emerged and along with an ally, you can take down the Dynamax\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon that live in there and get a rare Pok\u00e9mon with some useful items. New Dynamax Energies have been discovered that change more stats of the Pok\u00e9mon besides just HP! New people and adventures await!</p>\n<p><em><strong>(IMPORTANT!!!): Everything you see here is subject to change! Things like the current new Pok\u00e9mon/Trainer sprites are temporary and will be recreated from scratch to\u00a0match the quality of the rest of the already existing sprites. Also you can't search for the area of where to find a certain\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon\u00a0in the Pok</strong><em><strong>\u00e9</strong></em><strong>dex since when coding the areas in, the game crashes when opening the\u00a0<em>Pok<em><strong>\u00e9</strong></em>dex</em>\u00a0</strong><strong>. So for some old Pok\u00e9mon\u00a0they'll have their\u00a0preexisting\u00a0areas set.\u00a0</strong><strong>This will be fixed in future updates! Also there may be a few\u00a0typos inbound..</strong></em></p>\n<p>This is a non-profit Fan Game!\u00a0All materials used to help make this game belong to their original creators!
