Jump over tall \n      obstacles with a \"HOPPER\" and blast past your rivals at incredible \n      speeds with \"NITRO\"! What multiplayer game would be complete without \n      attack items? Use a forward-launching \"GRENADE\" or a backward-dropping \n      \"BOMBER\" to blow up and knock away your rivals!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
