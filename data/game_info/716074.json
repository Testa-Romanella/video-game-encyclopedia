It is designed to mimic a fantasy video game console, by emulating the harsh hardware limitations of the video game consoles around the 1980s. The harsh limitations of PICO-8 are carefully chosen to be fun to work with, to encourage small but expressive designs, and to give cartridges made with PICO-8 their own particular look and feel. The coding is accomplished through a Lua-based environment, in which users can create music, sound effects, sprites, maps, and games.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Arrows</strong>\u00a0- walk around |\u00a0<strong>Z\u00a0</strong>- change color palette |\u00a0<strong>X</strong>\u00a0- shoot</p>\n<p><strong>Gamepads are supported</strong>\u00a0as well, if you prefer to play that way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T05:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab3ae70c97bf946ca5d6155cb79aba4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Luiz Vieira"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
