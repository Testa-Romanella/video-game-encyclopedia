Every 15 seconds, the time will loop back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each character will do again the same movement but one, the Time Traveler, remembers his path and will slightly modify his action. Go Back in time over and over to look for his error and find him. There are 5 objects in the house that you can trigger to catch the characters' attention. The Time Traveler will remember your action even in the next time loop and will act in consequences. Use this at your advantage.
