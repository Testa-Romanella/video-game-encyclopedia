Hunters believe that the Source&#39;s magic is dangerous and consider it their duty to destroy it.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, two characters are created, which the player will control. You can choose the gender, appearance, features and skills of the characters.<br />\nThe game world is totally interactive. Almost all items can be transferred. For example, to make a barricade of them at the entrance. You can create strong combinations of objects. For example, tie a knife to a broomstick and get a spear.<br />\nIn the game world, much is connected. If the enemy is wet, it will be harder to defeat him with a fiery spell. The player&#39;s actions also do not remain without consequences, especially immoral, such as looting and murder.<br />\nBetween the characters is a dialogue. If it concerns a joint action, but the characters can not agree, the game itself will decide for them. It is interesting that the relationship in this pair can also develop in a romantic direction.</p>", "metacritic": 94, "released": "2015-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T20:41:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/33b/33b825c76382931df0fd8ecddf5caebe.jpg", "website": "http://www.divinityoriginalsin-enhanced.com/", "rating": 4.26, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 323, "owned": 3834, "beaten": 510, "toplay": 161, "dropped": 397, "playing": 117}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 108, "ratings_count": 977, "suggestions_count": 418, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 987, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Larian Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Focus Home Interactive", "Larian Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
