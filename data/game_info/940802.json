In the past I was never really setup to do a\u00a0 game Jam but that wasn't the case this time around. I've really worked around the clock to get what I got completed.\u00a0 There's still so much I had to leave out due to the 7-day time frame given.\u00a0 I'll go over what\u00a0I had to leave out and then I'll highlight what I plan on doing to this title\u00a0after the competition .</p>\n<p><strong>The Planning:</strong></p>\n<p>Day 1,\u00a0 I sat down and wrote out a list of all the features I wanted to try and get in.\u00a0 Needless to say the list grew extensively.\u00a0 I then categorized by crucial features, needed features, polish and fluff.\u00a0 Being a single person team I had my work cut out.</p>\n<p><strong>What I didn't finish</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Flee option ! If you turn a corner and bump into a lvl 10 mob then you'll have to fight him all the way as it is. I wanted to add Flee mode so you have a chance to get away,.</li><li>UI and proper\u00a0game options menus</li><li>Ground clutter and additional armor pickups.</li><li>Additional tile plates for more extravagant dungeons. Right now there are only 6 plates in the game and it still turned out pretty well.</li><li>Story - Mode ! I didn't even get a chance to touch a story-line and I had an excellent one in mind to.</li><li>Side quests and additional things to do.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>If enough interest in this project develops then I will continue work on it. Probably wouldn't take much more than a few months to turn into a full-fledged title release. Adding things like additional tile plates for fancier dungeons,\u00a0 more mob types, playing cards, story driven quests and a proper UI, not to mention bugs I wasn't able to get out in time.<br/></p>\n<p>In closing I would like to thank the people at <strong>7DRL</strong> for their loyalty with this game jam.\u00a0 This is the first time I've joined their jam but I hope it won't be the last ! Until next time. Good bye.</p>\n<p><strong>For game instructions hit F1 in game.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T12:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf5/cf50d903a76a1823a86cec830cc3be6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ronilivid@abinary.life"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
