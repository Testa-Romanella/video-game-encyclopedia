What will happen as they draw nearer to Celestia and aim for their wish?\u00a0Find out in One Final\u00a0Wish.</p>\n\n<p>One Final Wish was created for the Touch the Stars Game Jam, and thus was created in limited time. It's not as perfect and well polished as I would have liked, but it is completable from start to end, which is the first time I can say I've made a game be finished.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It uses no outside resources or plugins, instead relying on only what comes with base RPG Maker MZ. With a theme of the game jam being to show off what MZ can do, I wanted to take that to the limit and create a game using what everyone has access to, to show that anyone can create a game even without special art, or user plugins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I offer a huge thanks to Komodo for allowing us a copy of RPG Maker MZ to use for the game jam, and credit them all the work they've done with the music and other assets in the game, as without them One Final\u00a0Wish would not be possible.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T06:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45c/45ca9091030e542f85a552c06f817368.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meowsticks"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
