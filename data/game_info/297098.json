The Ancient Greeks described many\u00a0different kinds of love and we want to highlight these and enforce the message that 'Love is blind' and love is for all, no matter what you look like or who you are; male, female, gay, straight, human or animal.<br/>For the scenario we used a funfair at a seaside pier with a Ferris wheel so that a variety of elements could be added to the aim aspect of the game.<br/> A secondary theme of the game is based around silent movies of the 1930\u2019s so we gave the game black and white colours and text boxes used in black and white films. In addition this is achieved through the use of piano cabaret solo music which is very specific to the time period mentioned above.<br/> We wanted to give the player the option to experiment without the black and white filter and different music so we added options in the settings menu to allow the player to play their way.<br/>There are alternate messages\u00a0for each enchanted combination\u00a0so we encourage you to try to find the all of them.<br/><br/>Controls<br/></p>\n<p>Aim - Space</p>\n<p>Shoot - S</p>\n<p>Tilt - A + D<br/></p>\n<p>All on-screen buttons can be clicked with mouse</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/24187c741d9c5ddbd9ff754c81704899.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OctopusSoftworks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
