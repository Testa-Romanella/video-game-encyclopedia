A morning where every one of the nuclear plant thought it will be like every other day.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>No one knew there was a leak in the radiation chamber. When the door was opened....</p>\n<p>All those people of that plant were buried in the same Graveyard and a maze was built around it so no one can get into there. The keys of the Graveyard are under the trees of the Maze.</p>\n<p>But now. The guards of the maze are afraid. They are hearing noises from the maze. It looks like the effects of the radiation are coming in real after all these years. <br/>You have to get into the Graveyard.
