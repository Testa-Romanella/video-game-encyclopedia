Touch all the targets to beat the level and try to do it as fast as you can. There are 16 levels in total. They all kinda suck and it might be hard to know where you are supposed to go. So if you get frustrated and give up that's cool. Anyways, if your at all curious about how this game got made, I made a <strong>video</strong> on it. <br/></p>\n<p>Be cool, stay in school!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T05:32:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72c/72ce388bfad1370d73301c5d0fd0f756.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NewFutureKids"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
