The intention of the song was for it to be able to transmit the feeling of Russia during the Cold War, a society in full development, but living in constant fear caused by nuclear threat and a race against the world for the conquest of Space.\r\n</p>\n<p>So, to achieve this, we though that the main melody ought to be composed using only the notes of the chord F major but just as a kind of mask, actually the song is on minor chords. We also added \u00a0a little military drum to indicate that, even if there weren\u2019t active weapons, it was still a war.\r\n</p>\n<p>As the melody is in F major, it sounds amiable, we could even dare say a happy tune. What we do next is \u201ccorrupt\u201d it. While the melody represents the progress of society and suggest a content life, adding the minor chords A and F to the background we obtain a feeling of uncertainty to it, which captures the essence of the Cold War.\r\n</p>\n<p>The second part is the special race. We wanted it to represent the constant \u201cup and down\u201d through the journey to conquer the moon. Sometimes CRB is on top of the race, sometimes is in the last place. So, the melody travels ascending and descending the scale of G minor, which we choose so it could be epic/enigmatic.\r\n</p>\n<p>To link the two parts, we put a little figure in hopes it became easy to identify, as it is present most of the time in the song through the harmonics and it would grow in importance in the next songs.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Dark Side of the Moon\r\n</p>\n<p>It is supposed to an obscure and simplified version of the main theme, representing the established power of CRB.\u00a0 For a start, it is constructed on two peculiar chords, a G# major augmented and a D minor dismissed. This with the purpose to cause a sense of disturbance, but to add a glorious piece to it. The figure introduced in the main theme shows itself in key points of the song, and the arpeggio is the same we heard in Space March too, just in the correspondent chords.\r\n</p>\n<p>Moonlight\r\n</p>\n<p>In contrast to The Dark Side of the Moon, this is the defeated version of the main theme. It is composed on the key of C minor. It starts with the representative figure of CRB, but there is a catch on the second time it sounds, into the background there is another figure trying to emerge, which is the representative figure of the Capitalist Blue Eagles (CBE). The melody of the song is the same as it was in the second part of Space March, but it lacks certain parts and its chords are different, the sequence is becoming more and more like the CBE one, we even hear another figure of CBE at the middle of the melody, a figure that is ascending while that of CRB is descending. The race is now over, we hear the representative figure of CBE takes over the CRB.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Capitalist Blue Eagles\r\n</p>\n<p>Rise of the Eagle\r\n</p>\n<p>This is meant to be the main theme of the Capitalist Blue Eagles (CBE) and as such, we wanted it to represent the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d and their determination to win the Space Race, their desire to be on the top.\r\n</p>\n<p>So, we start with the first representative figure of (CBE), a raising sequence, a stair going up, like an eagle flying high to trap its prey. It also has a military march, to show us the war but also the discipline their goal needed. It\u2019s a Dorian scale, so it could sound epic and dreamy but also a bit mysterious. The other representative figure starts with the main melody, it\u2019s the complement of the first one. While the first is the eagle rising, the later is the eagle maintain the peace and then descending to catch the prey.\r\n</p>\n<p>The chords march complementing the melody, raising with it and maintaining the peace, it has almost an heroic sound, a desire to raise in power but with the charge of the fate of an entire country.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Taking Flight\r\n</p>\n<p>The victory song of the CBE. It\u2019s full of hope and cause of celebration for them. It\u2019s made alike the main theme, but where on the other was a F minor, now stand a proud F major. This makes the song a cry of victory, makes it sound happier than heroic, precisely because the uncertainty of war has been removed. But at we approach the end, the F minor returns one last time, to remind us that the war, even if it didn\u2019t have active weapons involved, still affected million of people, no matter if they won.\r\n</p>\n<p>Broken Wing\r\n</p>\n<p>The defeated song of CBE\r\n</p>\n<p>It starts with the second figure, the eagle trying to catch it prey, but the tune is a sad one, and when later we heard the first figure trying to raise once again, it is cut before it could reach the next note, it never takes flight again and remains incomplete. In addition to it, the song is marching on the two chords of the CRB song, and as the theme progress, we even start hearing the CRB sounds more and more. We end the song with the figure of CBE descending to a flat F, in which the representative figure of CRB is constructed in dominance.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Credit song\r\n</p>\n<p>Approaching the Unknown\r\n</p>\n<p>It needed to represent that one of the sides finally won, so it is an ascendant scale that starts in C, the base of the most common scale. The respective chords that accompany it are C minor, F minor, G minor and a Ab major. When it reaches the top, it repeats again, but this time stronger cause it has the complete chords as base.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the beginning we just hear a single instrument doing the arpeggio, whoever won, got into the space, unsure of what it would face. But then, the ascending scale repeats, this time it has \u201cbackups\u201d, because one thing is certain, the space is the future, and they reached it first. So, in the second part of the song we now have a melody, although the arpeggio of the chords is still played by other instruments. The melody is a legacy, it\u2019s the journey they did that brought them to the moon and back to earth.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Right-click to select a character.</li><li>Escape key to deselect a character.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:07:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2af/2afae1d083b76ff8af8233d11e96c8de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ang Bury", "Aranzua", "AmeGK", "IronPrime99"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
