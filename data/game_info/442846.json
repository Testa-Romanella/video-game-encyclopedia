For example, with the default controller configuration, moving the right analog stick up and to the left will cause the fighter to throw a straight punch with his left hand, while holding down the right trigger while performing the same movement and then holding R1 will cause the fighter to raise his guard to the left side of his head, ready to attempt a parry.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2004-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-24T19:43:18", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox", "GameCube"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts Canada", "NuFX"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["EA SPORTS"], "esrb_rating": null}
