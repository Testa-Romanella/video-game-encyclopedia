The theme for this jam was, \"Intentional Bugs\". My idea was to mix an actual computer bug with a play-on-words of \"bug\".</p>\n<p>After a computer glitch throws you into the world of bugs, you must survive using your own two--bug spray cans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is only my second game jam, and I am still fairly new to game development. My previous jam was for Ludum Dare 45. With a limited time frame, my game happens to have a couple bugs, however, they are unfortunately not intentional. I will try to further improve my skills, but for now, enjoy this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fe/0fefe63cee62180da3be8d5f66db3c8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BankShotZombies"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
