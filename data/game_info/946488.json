The player must use echolocation in order to see objects in the world, as well as ping and activate stations. Once all stations are activated, the player wins the game. However, there are agents patrolling who wish to stop the player. Agents will chase the player and deactivate any activated stations. If the player runs into them too much, they lose the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Made by:</strong></p>\n<p>Mason Kubiak,\u00a0Randy Le,\u00a0Elroy\u00a0Saltzherr</p>\n<p><strong>Sound\u00a0Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Freesound - \"bass 16b.wav\" by Veiler</p>\n<p>Freesound - \"Bass octave tones V03 Dry 02 C1.wav\" by josefpres<br/></p><p>Freesound - \"robot or machine destroy.wav\" by nsstudios</p><p>Freesound - \"Level Up\" by ImATaco<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T17:10:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aac322b16ec3c58e46db810922a723d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Koobysnack", "Tei Hek", "esaltzherr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
