This project is a kind of 3D platforming collectathon(?), this may change (again idk). The controls are simple, you can use either w, a, s, d or the arrow keys or a joystick controller to move. To jump currently only the space bar has been tested. To move the camera, move the mouse around the screen. enjoy this demo and I'd really appreciate feedback (cause first time and all). YAY! (P.S I've provided development screenshots cause why not)</p><p>UPDATE: There is now a Windows version of the game. so have fun Windows users \u00a0 \u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:44:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d054a92a5109b0270c2ecf5226020d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Misty"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
