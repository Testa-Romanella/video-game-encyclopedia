This will eventually progress you up a level increasing the amount of demons that spawn and the rate in which the demons spawn.</p>\n<p>This game was developed\u00a0for my Web Game Development Module at University, hope you enjoy it!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T15:35:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc6/bc65c7fc95ea5116380dba939baf4f1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["li0nleo"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
