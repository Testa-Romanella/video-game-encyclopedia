There are 5 different levels, an infinite mode (maybe a secret level, why not ?), and a shop with various skins.<br/>It took me 3 weeks/1 month to make it so I hope you will enjoy, even if it's just a little. I did all the graphics and the development, and i used free musics by \"airtone\", \"Fupicat\" and \"myfox14\" (thanks to them).</p>\n<p>I'm a beginner so if you find bugs, please report them to me to improve the Game.</p>\n<p>I used GameMaker to make the Game, Pixel Studio for the graphics, and jsfxr for some sounds (everything is detailed in the Credits of the Game).</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to my friends for their support but specially to my parents, and to Ilyes, Augustin and Benjamin.</p>\n<p>I really hope that you will enjoy this short Game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T07:37:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d42/d42f792f6bb69ee1ca18658f8b554b25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ulysse"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
