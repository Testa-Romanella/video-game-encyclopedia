Your main goal is to reach the exit terminal with the nanobot in each room.</p>\n\n<p>Along the way you will find terminals and robots to help you reach your goal. If you fly into a terminal, it will become \"active\" and you can spawn nanobots from it.</p>\n\n<p>When you activate a terminal, a nearby robot will also become active. An active robot won't disappear if you leave it. You can tell a robot is active when its eyes are purple.</p>\n\n<p>You can use the Q and E buttons to scroll between active robots and terminals. You'll find all sorts of interesting bots along the way. They all have unique abilities, so play around with the controls to see what they do!</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Have fun, and thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a03/a038a2abc774b559ae9f0e96c99cf026.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["FabledForgeGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
