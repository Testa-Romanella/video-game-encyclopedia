The game is not in an early stage of development per say, but there's still lots of work that can be done and will be done in the future to flesh it out more.</strong></p>\n<p>ranDOOM is a first person shooter mainly based on the two original DOOM games that were released in the 90s. It also takes some inspiration from modern DOOM games and some of their mods, like the Enemy Randomizer Mod for DOOM Eternal.</p>\n<p>Enemies aren't the only thing that is randomized in this game though. The levels you play, the music that plays, the weapons that spawn as well as the powerups are also random. They will always spawn in the same place but will always change in almost every playthrough.</p>\n<p>The game currently features 2 unfinished levels, 2 different music styles, a wide variety of\u00a0demons, secrets, cheats, all the classic weapons and more.</p>\n<p>I do not own any of the music, textures and sounds used in this game. The textures &amp; sounds belong to id Software. The music belongs to Bobby Prince and Andrew Hulshult.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T15:28:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d8/2d8869ac24be5abba46e9b1a27c3777b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JS"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
