This is currently a prototype, but\u00a0I intend to keep updating the game over the next few months and potentially onwards.\u00a0<br/><br/>Things to know ---<br/>- Currently Unfinished: There is currently no way to actually beat the game. Reaching level five will allow the player to\u00a0loop back to level one so you can play the game again.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>- I do not expect you to reach the goal of 6,000 points: Reaching the end goal of \"$6,000\" would be an arduous task that I do not expect you to actually achieve. I do however challenge anyone with that kind of free time to go for it.<br/><br/>Feel free to play the game as much as you want for free, but if can spare a dime (or 20) its greatly appreciated and you'll be supporting a dream.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy, and I look forward to updating this content as I continue my development journey!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Assets Used:</p>\n<ul><li>Sky background | OpenGameArt.org Paul Riva\r\n  </li><li>country field | OpenGameArt.org Sam\r\n  </li><li>Pixel House and Fence | OpenGameArt.org www.instagram.com/fethalis\\\r\n  </li><li>Mini Pack - Money | OpenGameArt.org photoshopwizard\r\n  </li><li>Lunchbox SVG | OpenGameArt.org Jordan Irwin (AntumDeluge)\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T17:01:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e52/e524df01f497f971fb57848e0abb36a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SunnyJay"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
