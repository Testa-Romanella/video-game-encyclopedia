We didn't make a very good game because the programmer(me) lost motivation and we weren't very organized. We still learnt a lot of valuable lessons. Maybe next time we can make a playable game. Anyways, sorry about how I kept on saying the music is good in the video and how you couldn't hear it properly. I was really tired and I said some pretty stupid stuff.\u00a0Thanks for the fun and see you guys next time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12d/12dea70992574ea4b2e5ca460d611473.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheButler3000"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
