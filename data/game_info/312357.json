I'm afraid we're having a bit of a problem up here, and I think you might just be able to help.\u00a0You see, some of our stars have gotten lost. The constellations are all out of order, and the lost stars aren't shining as bright as they used to. But I'm sure you could put them back where they belong.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why don't we try it out with that little lost star right next to you? Just stand next to it and give it a push towards that pink target. And remember, if you need help remembering where the stars need to go, just press X for a hint.\"</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move, bump into objects to interact with them. You need to get all the lost stars in their proper place\u00a0to fix the constellation. Once you put a star on a target, it won't move again. The hearts in the top corner show how many hints you have available.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>There are 6 constellations that need fixing - repair them all to beat the game.\u00a0If you make a mistake, press Z to undo the last move you made. If you get\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0stuck, press R to\u00a0reset the level.\r\n</p>\n<p>Game made in\u00a0PuzzleScript, music made in BeepBox.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a05b6ae29b1525ae839d1042254db8de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["andimlenny"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
