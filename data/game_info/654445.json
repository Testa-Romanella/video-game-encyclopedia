{"id": 654445, "slug": "sd-card-battle", "name": "SD Card Battle", "name_original": "SD Card Battle", "description": "<p>This prototype (5 consecutive battles)\u00a0is based on Tu-Jeon \ud22c\uc804 (or widely know as Sutda \uc12f\ub2e4 in Korea), a traditional Korean gamble\u00a0which has many similarities with Poker, and I have mixed it up with Texas Holdem rules. This is my very first submission to any game site and I am still quite nervous about it while writing this detail section :P\r\n</p>\n<p>The idea behind came from the old classic mobile game Sword &amp; Poker, which has been taken down long time ago and I just wanted to create a similar experience that S&amp;P gave me long time ago.\r\n</p>\n<p>I would be really grateful if I could get some feedback on specifically the battle system and whether the battle is fun or not, as I am still uncertain whether I would want to continue to develop\u00a0it (with better graphics and ui and procedural map and\u00a0everything else that require more and more work)\u00a0to make a full rogue-lite style card-battler like Slay the spire... I know the UI and presentation is kind of a mess right now, but the whole idea on the battle system\u00a0is in there :)</p>\n<p><strong>- How to play -</strong></p>\n<p>Drag and drop your card (lower lane) on to the community cards which are in the middle lane to make a match.\u00a0The result will be calculated and compared with enemy's pair for attack decision. Your card and enemy's will be deposited to the community card which both enemy and you can use in the next turn,\u00a0so you must consider next step when you choose your card.</p>\n<p>There are several skills you can utilize as you see fit as well, in order to lower the dependencies on luck and chance. Make sure to check out the damages and effect of card rank\u00a0your weapon has as weapon changes almost every stage. Understanding the mechanics will help you progress much easier.</p>\n<p>Each round consists of 3 turns, and after each round, all cards are shuffled and your (tiny) shield bar will be refilled.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0Rules (the Ranks)\u00a0-\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Royal Pair &gt; Pair &gt; 0 as Ones place &gt; other combinations</strong></p>\n<p>There are three royal cards, 1, 2, and 10. When two of them are paired, they are the strongest pair you can make.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A simple pair (1+1, 5+5, 10+10) are the next in rank.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next in rank is sum of two cards ends in 0 on the Ones place. (1+9, 2+8 ... 4+6) The order within this rank depends on the higher number (9 is highest) and whether it contains a royal card (so 1 royal + 9 is strongest)</p>\n<p>Lowest rank is simple combination where number doesn't add up to be 0 in Ones place. (3+4, 10 + 5 which will be 5, 9\u00a0+ 5 etc.) And bigger the stronger.</p>\n<p>There are certain special combinations, a pair counter (10 + 9) which is a 9er when up against everything other than pairs, or an immunity (9+4) which nullifies all damages up to pairs.</p>\n<p><strong>-\u00a0Others -</strong></p>\n<p>I've included traditional mode (sutda) where the rank calculations are a bit more complex and has a special suit which has a bit different effect... and you can enable it in the option menu. But! the descriptions and outcome text will change to Korean, since I have no clue on how to translate the original terminology into English, or even if I did it could only bring more confusion. Anyhow, you are always welcome to try it out if you need more challenge. :)</p>\n<p><strong>- Credits -</strong></p>\n<p>I've used many free assets from itch.io from awesome artists such as\u00a0</p>\n<p>LuizMelo\u00a0- Enemies</p>\n<p>Elthen's Pixel Art Shop\u00a0- Enemy<br/></p>\n<p>Clembod\u00a0- Protagonist</p>\n<p>cafeDraw\u00a0- Card template</p>\n<p>0x72\u00a0- Weapons<br/></p>\n<p>I can't seem to recall where\u00a0I got the pixel UI assets.. sorry (please let me know if you think it's yours)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T12:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dab/dabdc0f0663a918887f8d93845e1e701.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["vonhoon"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
