We grew up creating games with RPG Maker 2003 and once we learned how to program we decided to move to other engines. Now we are creating <strong>Ashborn</strong>, a story-driven action RPG with rich world-building.<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@astra_dei\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n<p>We think that it would be very interesting to work together with the community to build and improve our game. This is why we plan to relase alphas frequently and get some useful feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>First Combat Alpha Demo</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Our first alpha is based on one of the core game mechanics of our game: combat. We want to create a game with <strong>satisfying </strong>and yet <strong>challenging combat system</strong>. To achieve this, we implemented several mechanics that are not usually seen in 2d action RPGs like the posibility to <strong>parry </strong>and <strong>face </strong>the enemies. In this alpha, you can test some of those mechanics, but take into account this is just a preliminary version and only the most basic actions are implemented. No skills, no experience points, no special combos, no range attacks...<br/></p>\n<p>The demo is divided in two parts: first a <strong>tutorial </strong>to learn the controls and then an <strong>arena </strong>where you will face waves of enemies of increasing difficulty. In addition, we implemented a <strong>online high scores ranking</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>You can check your score here:</strong><br/>http://astradei.com/hslist.php</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we created a poll to know the opinion of the players. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Please, give us your feedback</strong> HERE <br/></p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n<p><strong>General features</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Multilanguage: English and Spanish</p>\n<p>- Controller and Keyboard support</p>\n<p>- Tutorial and interaction with NPCs</p>\n<p>- Statistics and online ranking system</p>\n\n<p><strong>Combat features</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Real-time potion drinking</p>\n<p>- Targeting system</p>\n<p>- Dash</p>\n<p>- Parry and executions<br/></p>\n<p>- Block</p>\n<p>- Attack (with multiple animations)<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:39:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/ded71a9ba6068d9572ba6c664ffab0f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AstraDei"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
