I didn't have time at the time of the jam, so started preparing it earlier, just to see what I could do.</p>\n<p>Pick the cards to damage your opponent as best as you can!... or exchange the cards to form powerful combos to damage them even more!<br/></p>\n<p>Additional playing tips:</p>\n<p>- Using cards of the same color give you a slight boost<br/>- The combos work only when you send out only the parts of the combo to attack</p><p>There are more tips to write, so I'll add those in the future.</p>\n<p>The game is currently available only for Windows. If the game freezes while waiting for Player2, try changing the difficulty to \"Practice\". I've yet to learn what is causing this issue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T11:10:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/598/598e5543899bd60a5d3e3c4d24cfe373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rosomak360"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
