To fix these sectors, the player must reach the red boxes at the end of each level, turning these into green.</p>\n<p>This is inspired by real-life hard disk analysis programs, which usually plot the hard disk sectors as a grid in which the correct sectors are marked with a green cell, and the incorrect ones with a red cell. From the gameplay perspective, Project Daemon is mostly a 2D platforming game, with some influences of rhythm-based games.<br/></p>\r\nWalkthrough\r\n<br/>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Move: WASD, Gamepad joystick</li><li>Jump/Advance Conversation: Space, Gamepad button \"A\"</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made by Samuel Soutullo Sobral</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Retro Future Music Pack (by IMAscore):\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/electronic/retro-futur...</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Data wing</li><li>Super Mario Galaxy</li><li>The Impossible Game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T05:34:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/516d36f91cd17958a2c4cb9f13bec6f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samuel Soutullo Sobral"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
