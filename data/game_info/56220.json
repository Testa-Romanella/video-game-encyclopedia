The basic premise of the game is that the plot, settings, characters, and other mechanics consist of essentially mixing and combining the like of Gundam, Mazinger, Getter Robo, Zettai Muteki Raijin-Oh, and many other mecha-based anime and manga series into one universe. The Super Robot Wars series has existed for a fairly long time, dating back to the Nintendo Game Boy, and has had many releases since then, across possibly all of the mainstream platforms since then, including the SNES, PS, PS2, GameCube, Game Boy and later iterations, among other platforms. It was ported to the Xbox 360 under the title Super Robot Wars XO (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5927\u6226XO, S\u016bp\u0101 Robotto Taisen Ekkusu \u014c), which had an online mode called Super Robot Competition (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u5bfe\u6226, S\u016bp\u0101 Robotto Taisen).</p>\n<p>The Super Robot Wars universe features a great variety of anime series, and below is a list of such.
