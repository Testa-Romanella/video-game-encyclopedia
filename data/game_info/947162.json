The platforms are infinitely generated, I really hope you enjoy the game :D\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, the song for when you are actually playing (not in main menu or death screen) was generated by an AI because I could not figure out how to make a song that fit it in piano so I\u00a0just got one that sounded good from an ai song generator... even though it is not a piano song... Anyways, this is the first game I\u00a0have ever finished and my second project ever, so expect it to not be amazing, but I think it is pretty good (although I am definitely biased).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T08:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1da/1da897d131a0acb6c4599967b56fe770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mopanion Studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
