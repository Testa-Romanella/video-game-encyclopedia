You stayed out of his way before, but now you are on a quest to take him down. It plays like a turn-based game, but isn't actually turn-based. It will make more sense once you play it.</p>\n<p>Tools Used:<br/>GameMaker: Studio<br/>Audacity<br/>Cosmic DJ (Only for one song though)<br/>Hydrogen</p>\n<p>Everything was made by me because I am so hip and cool.</p>\n<p>Cheating<br/>The game is a bit lengthy and very difficult, which kind of takes away from the theme. To make sure everyone can get to the final boss, I added a level skip.<br/>Hold enter, hold Q, and press shift to skip a level.<br/>I strongly recommend playing the tutorial first.</p>\n<p>Features:<br/>24 Levels<br/>3 Bosses<br/>7 Songs<br/>Controller Support<br/>A true heart-warming tale with riveting dialogue and revolutionary story telling.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef6/ef61cd2d427903bc2f04e572f3c59665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steven Miller"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
