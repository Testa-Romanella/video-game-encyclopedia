The player takes on the role of a robot sent to investigate a member of a subversive organization.</p>\n<p>The game was made in Unity as part of a class at the Royal Danish\u00a0Academy's Games and Interaction Design program. Play time is about 10 minutes, and in some ways it is more of a proof of concept than a fully fleshed out game.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Esben Holk Nielsen: Art direction, concept art, 3D assets, 2D assets, procedural generation</li><li>Yixin Song: Level design, narrative design</li><li>Ella Tamara Albeck Grandjean: Concept art</li><li>Stine Boesgaard: 3D lead, level design, 2D assets, asset management</li><li>Jo Dalsgaard: Programming lead, narrative lead, production management, level design, sound design, music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T18:55:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e5/3e575f305441238f640d59364cb9deeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JoDalsgaard", "stineb"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
