You think beer pong just grow on trees? It takes cash, cold hard cash,\u00a0but that's where you are in luck. The local frat is selling some goodies, which are yours for the taking. Which can lead to new dialogue or even new scenes...or you can just keep them in your inventory.\u00a0I won't judge you.</p>\n<p><strong>RNG:\u00a0</strong>Life is a lot like poker;\u00a0each player plays the same game,\u00a0but no two players will have the same hands. The same could be said for\u00a0SG,\u00a0as throughout the game many things are randomized, such as a\u00a0simple greeting to the very people you meet. Are you going to sit on the sidelines or draw a hand to see what Lady Luck has in store for you?</p>\n<p><strong>Boys:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0<strong>SG</strong>\u00a0features six romance options, three of which are present in any given run, with some of them being tougher shells to crack. However can love bloom in the courtyard? Tell me, I'm dying to know.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Endings</strong>:\u00a0There's a slight sadness felt as you near the end of a book. However, it doesn't always have to be sad.\u00a0As such,\u00a0<strong>SG\u00a0</strong>features multiple possible endings(the total amount of which I can't divulge at this time). You'll always start out as a girl in your first days of high school. Where you end up, well, that's part of the fun.</p>\r\nWho made this?\r\n<p>JasonCLA-Responsible for Visuals/Writing (Twitter/Instagram)<br/>Malemaidcafe-Responsible for Coding/Music/Writing (Twitter/Bandcamp)<br/></p>\n\r\nGot a problem?\r\n<p>If you have any problems or need to ask me something in relation to SG1in7M.
