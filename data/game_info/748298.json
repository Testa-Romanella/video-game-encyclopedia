Explore a small village and its surrounding\u00a0areas now\u00a0overrun by undead, uncover the cause of this rise, and purge the land of this\u00a0creeping darkness.</p>\n<p>Defeat enemies of varying difficulty, overcome small but tight platforming challenges, and uncover secrets sprinkled throughout the zones.</p>\n<p>-----<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Move left/right: A/D, Arrow Keys, D-Pad</p>\n<p>Climb up/down: W/S, Arrow Keys, D-Pad<br/></p>\n<p>Jump: Space, Button-East</p>\n<p>Interact: E, Z, Button-North</p>\n<p>Shoot: Left-Click, Left Ctrl, Button\u00a0South</p>\n<p>Dodge: Right-Click, Left Alt, Button-West</p>\n<p>Pause/Menu: Esc, Start</p>\n<p>Zone\u00a0Stats: F, Select</p>\n<p>-----<br/></p>\n<p>This is a small game with between 15-45 minutes worth of play time.
