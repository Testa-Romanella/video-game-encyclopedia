It can be played alone, but that is weird. And difficult.</strong></p>\n<p>Are you out of controll-ers but still want to play a multiplayer game? Do you also want to have very little control over that game? Cool. Then play this game.<br/><br/>You control either a frog or a parrot shaped like a ball and your only way to control is to flick your control stick like a sling shot and hope for the best. Try to knock the other opponent off the map to score points and try to prevent yourself from falling. Whoever has the highest score after two minutes wins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:56:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41a82a12273807d0a6829453ae216395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["luketpena"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
