{"id": 12284, "slug": "glider-island", "name": "Glider Island", "name_original": "Glider Island", "description": "There are 3 maps and each map comes with unique scenery, soundtrack and surprise event. You much complete each map sequentially to unlock the next map. The first map is Forest Island with 150 hoops and every two minutes a thunderstorm occurs and you must fight the wind. The second map is Volcano Island with 175 hoops and every two minutes a Volcano erupts and you must dodge lava bombs! The Last Island is Desert Island with 200 hoops and every two minutes a Dust Storm occurs and you must fly with limited visibility and wind. <br/><br/>Plot your course carefully to try and collect all the hoops in the fastest time possible. You will earn Bronze, Silver or Gold depending on how fast you complete each level. <br/><br/>Glider Island is designed for Virtual Reality but can be played perfectly fine without it too! There are 4 ways you can choose to control the glider:<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Vive/Oculus Hand Controllers:</strong> Use your hands to grab the glider and control the glider through your outstretched hands!<br/></li><li><strong>VR Head Movement:</strong> - Move your head up, down, left and right to control the glider, this way is a little easier and causes less motion sickness. <br/></li><li><strong>Xbox controller: (No VR Required)</strong> - Use the Xbox controller to steer the glider while looking around with your head.<br/></li><li><strong>Mouse Flight: (No VR Required)</strong> - Simply use your mouse and keyboard. This is the easiest flight method and does not require a VR headset.</li></ul><br/><strong>BONUS*</strong>: FREE ACCESS to Glider Sim Prototype! This is a much more simulated hang glider experience also developed by 5D Realities. It is a work in progress and will most likely be our next VR title on steam.
