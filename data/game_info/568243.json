I know the quality is not much but I hope you enjoy the game. The idea that seeds the game is simple: make death be the goal; and I kinda needed to brainstorm some ideas to make dying challenging and I came out with the idea of needing a lot of fall damage to die.</p>\n<p>Control: Arrow keys</p><p>In this version submitted for Wowie Jam, there are 4 stages in total with simple mechanics of falling from high places being the goal.</p>\n<p>Btw I think\u00a0stage 4 is very difficult but I can assure you it's possible; I've tested it.</p>\n<p>Really wanted to add some music but... with only ~1hr left by the end I finished all the features and contents I wanted to put into, I just can't; I can't make any music in just 1hr...</p><p>P.S.: Ich liebe Jonas Tyroller</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:03:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/328967a842704f79dcd9dcd95891a390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ran d'Reille"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
