Compete on <em>side-by-side playzones</em>, where competitors fight for the next available piece. Puzzle pieces are different to traditional  Tetris tetromino pieces, making for extra unique gameplay. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Defend against opponent </strong>attacks by <em>clearing single lines</em>. This\u00a0boosts your power meter and slows your drop rate giving you more time to place your puzzle pieces.</p>\n<p><strong>Attack your opponent </strong>by <em>using combos</em>. There are currently 2 combos available:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Multi-line</strong> - clear 2 or more lines at the same time</li><li><strong>Solid-line </strong>- clear a line with all one colour</li></ol>\n<p>Single-player gaming is also available - compete against the computer AI. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T03:18:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/8975ce1efc4710e4f6cf763170b064d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cagedjedi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
