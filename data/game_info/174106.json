Your score is determined by the time and damage you took, as well as the average temperature for the entire run. To maximize score, be quick and evade enemies while keeping your temperature high --- but be careful, high temperatures empower your enemies.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Enter to Start Game/Return to Menu When Game Ends<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0- WASD or Arrow Keys\u00a0to move Up/Left/Down/Right</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Left Shift to Increase Speed</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Left Control to Decrease Speed</p>\n<p>- F11 to toggle Fullscreen</p><p>- R to Restart Level</p><p>- Escape to Quit</p>\n\n<p>Hints:</p>\n<p>1.

Once an enemy has line-of-sight, it will track you briefly without line-of-sight.
