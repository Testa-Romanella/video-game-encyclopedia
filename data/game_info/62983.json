To survive one must navigate the complex web of cities and pair with the denizens dwelling within: team up with the best, prioritize tasks, and weigh choices to guide the world towards the desired end.Meaningful Progression:<br/>While equipped with a main plot that spans over 20 hours and 60 thousand words, the game provides much more than simply level grinding in its progression. Herbs, alchemy, trading, and other methods all provide means to develop your characters. Dungeons and battles are distributed to enable variety in tactics and character customization. We want every battle and dungeon to be meaningful.An Open World:<br/>Time might be the essence in a failing world, yet the game never punishes the curious. Explorations and ventures into the undiscovered are encouraged: key dates and deadlines will be extended upon side-plot completion. The individual stories and overarching plot would not be missed for those aiming to dive deep into the clockwork behind the world.Contents:<br/>1.6 playable characters, each with their own ideals, backstory, and side-plots.<br/>2.a main plot spanning 40 thousand words, with 20 thousand words of side-plots and settings<br/>3.a battle system that focuses on variety and strategy, with a wide arsenal of items and skill combos<br/>4.plant cultivation, hunting, mining, studying, lottery tickets, bank robbing\u2026<br/>5.emerging relationships between your characters that can be furthered and developed into romancesFeatures:<br/>1.immersive plot focused on progression and role-playing<br/>2.a full fantasy world decorated with details<br/>3.unique art style that adds flavor yet never distracts<br/>4.an OST crafted with loveAbout Us:<br/>ETS game started as a group of college students. After distributing our first game in Nov 2016, we shifted our focus to developing and honing this current project. The current product you are seeing right now has already been through remake five times during the twenty-one months development period.<br/><br/>Because our previous game have remained free throughout, we are still limited in our resources. As we have already graduated from our colleges, we have invested much into this game, hoping a moderate success would enable a career into what we all love. Thus, we wish that all players could enjoy this game to help contribute to our fledging game development career.<br/><br/>[Translated by LBQ]", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e6/1e61f94ba065899b892c32a62fa68299.jpg", "website": "http://www.falsemen.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5403\u4e86\u5c31\u7761\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["\u5403\u4e86\u5c31\u7761\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
