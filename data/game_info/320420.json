It is your job to go in and shut it down.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nProtogenesis features a more accurate representation of firearms handling, including multi-step reloading, and screen-space aiming. The level is randomly generated during play and players have a phisicaly based inventory system. Players get rewarded in game credits for destroying targets found in the level that they can then use to purchase more magazines and ammo. The game also features a firing range so players can practice aiming and judging distances outside of the level before entering the level proper.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/049/04946067e6d785207144705269172e12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Sigma Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dark Sigma Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
