(Aidanb416)", "description": "<p>This is a Diner Dash type game, where you try to fill as many orders as you can to get more points. In this game however, you have a control meter, the less control you have (more lost orders, wrong orders, pending orders) the less control, and the higher multiplier of points you will get. Watch out, though, because if you lose to much control, you will go into 'Out of Control' mode and start rapidly losing points. Unfortunately\u00a0this is quite a buggy game, (orders will overlap, sometimes scenes wont load), so if you find a bug try to just push past it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Aidan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:16:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c39/c390863f2078da4e73889df47141ebf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Aidanb416"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
