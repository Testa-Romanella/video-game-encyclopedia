You may start off weak - <strong>but soon enough that will change...</strong></p>\n<strong>MEET THE WILDLIFE</strong>\n<p>YOU!</p><p>You're the star of this show- an adorable little slime monster now, but soon to be something much bigger, much more powerful. For now, though, just look at how cute you are! And who knows, maybe you'll still be just as cute three mutations from now.<br/></p><p> ABGAB CORALS</p><p>These flora are common all across the planet, as you can see, and they produce a strange noxious gas wherever they go. Not that it's any bother to you, but it does look funny. They also secrete a thin film of slime around them, and slowly breathe up and down if you look closely. Charming.<br/></p><p> DANGLEFRUITS</p><p>These tough, vinelike plants are fairly inert and harmless, but are famed for their delicious organonitrous fruits - they're explosively good! Whilst they mostly grow down from the ceiling, some more exotic varities have been known to grow upwards, to the relief of farmers across the galaxy.<br/></p><p> SPITBUG</p><p>These hostile fauna may seem always angry and aggressive - but they're really just misunderstood! They're very protective of their homes, but won't bother you if you go elsewhere. Remeber, they're just as scared of you as you are of them! Just watch out for their corrosive spit.</p><p> <strong> </strong>SPIKELICHEN<br/></p><p>These thorny fellows are actually large colonies of fungus and algae, in a lovely symbiotic relationship to help each other out. When trimmed, they can be used as a harmless decorative plant, but when left untrimmed for too long, they form into nasty spikes, so watch out around them, and if you're going to grow some then don't forget to prune it now and again!<br/></p>\n<strong>MY THOUGHTS</strong>\n<p>This is probably one of my favorite games I've made so far! Personally, I really like how the artwork turned out, particularly with only six colours, and playing around with the player exploding into chunks was great fun too. I feel like I could've maybe integrated the theme a bit more clearly; evolution on a living planet is sort of related to the theme Signs of Life, but I would've liked to make it even more closesly linked. Still, I'm happy with what I've got, and it was a blast to make it in only 48 hours. And hopefully, you enjoy the game as much as I do! Thanks to all the folks over at Area of Effect for making this all possible. And why not share your time with me too? See if you can beat my record of around 4m 40s. Go on, I'd love to see you try!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:01:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be7/be78afe4c425bda21a1160a200ec28d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cakestorm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
