I could add something to recharge life, but that would facilitate too much, prolonging play sessions without need. Also, filling the energy would diminish the risk of using the shield explosion, since the trade-off (opening your guard for a moment to unleash an attack) could be mitigated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5a/d5aa8e68ecfcc6ebd41cc1665589bbdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bruno Assarisse"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
