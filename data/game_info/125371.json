The controls are simple, space for jump and mouse for firing and aiming. The goal is to simply avoid enemy missiles and bullets while spikes and obstacles to gain a highscore. There is an easteregg in the game if anyone would like to try and find it. I would like to add that the game is quite hard to play so you'll likely get frustrated with it playing it.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, there is an issue with the game where most anti-virus programs will flag it as a potential threat or virus as it's an unknown executable, if anyone knows a fix for this besides putting the game on steam and launching it through that\u00a0(a trusted program) I would much appreciate it :)</p>\n<p>I do plan on finishing this game and packing it put with nice UI, leaderboards and saves and also building it for Mac, Linux and Android devices.</p>\n<p>Just an added side note: The music in the game is a cover I made a song from Undertale, it's not that great of a cover but I included it as the game was dull without the music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee0/ee0cf616b941db581ef3af0130a0bf60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex666"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
