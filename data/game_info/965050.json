Will he be able to save the kingdom from his brother's maleficent scheme?<h3>A New Take on Metroidvania</h3>Fallen Prince is an atmospheric, combat-focused metroidvania game. It combines retro elements (e.g. no inventory, pixel graphics) with a modern, souls-like combat system (adapted to the needs of a platformer). Our hero is a warrior, risen from the dead. Wielding just a shield and a sword, you must help him find and defeat his brother, after overcoming his undead spawnlings and the many obstacles present in this wretched, barren land. The fate of the kingdom lies in your hands!<h3>Development Team</h3>Eridanus Games was formed on account of a 'Game Development' online course, provided by the Hellenic Open University. Fallen Prince was conceptualized and developed in the span of three months (on zero budget), and it is also our first joined effort\u2014so please go easy on us!
