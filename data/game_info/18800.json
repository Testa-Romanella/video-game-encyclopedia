Each player has the same amount of cards from the beginning to the end. There is no f2p/pay2win model, you all have same chances at the start. <br/><br/>Before you start the game, you will need to create your deck. Deck needs to have 1 hero and 5 playing cards. You can have as many decks as you wish to have. These 5 cards are all what you have during one game. You do not sacrifice any of them.<br/><br/><strong>Key Features:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Singleplayer (PVE)<br/></li><li>Cross platform multiplayer (2-4players)<br/></li><li>Simultaneous turns<br/></li><li>Realtime turns<br/></li><li>Co-op (1vs2, 1vs3 2vs2) (players vs players &amp; players vs AI-bot)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c1/8c1a4c94750835dc276f017c04d1b3c4.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/wolfwarsgame/?fref=ts", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 22}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter Hrdy"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Peter Hrdy"], "esrb_rating": null}
