Gets even more pissed off when you move your mouse. Tired of moving around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no idea how to give this kinda-game a good description, so I'll just say it as it is: attempt to click a dot using your mouse/trackpad. It sounds incredibly easy, until, yeah you get the idea. The dot types also vary in playstyle and difficulty, some simple, some complex, some hard but possible, some you'd have to, yeah, give up. Y'know the saying \"easy to learn, hard to master\"? Yeah, that but in dots and mice.</p>\n\n\n<p>Made with wick editor:\u00a0https://www.wickeditor.com/#/</p>\n\n\n<p>oh, and dont forget to be careful with the virus one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:02:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a9/8a9dc941629cab9f58788f600a73ffc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lazybutter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
