Fight against the\u00a0monsters by commanding your people and building buildings to protect and attack the monster!<br/></p>\n<p>This is a boss rush real-time action strategy game made for TOJam13, with the help of Martin Bernie (@itsPusher) doing audio, and Hes Bell (@Hes_Bell) doing the art that actually looks good.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's a tutorial in the game that explains the rules and controls of the game.</p>\n<p>You'll also need a controller to play this game. I've only tested it with a XBox 360 controller, but maybe it'll work with other controllers?</p>\n<p>Please note that this game currently only supports one resolution of 1280x720. You shouldn't have to worry about it since it'll start like that automatically, but if you try to muck around with the resolution unfortunately the game won't look very nice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b58/b586b275dab9314e9d6085a73be93bfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tondo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
