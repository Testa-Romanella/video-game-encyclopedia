{"id": 164641, "slug": "amnesiacs-act-i", "name": "Amnesiacs: Act I", "name_original": "Amnesiacs: Act I", "description": "<p>Amnesiacs is a response to the magnified emotions teenagers feel when they assume adult \u00a0responsibilities and deal with depression, anxiety, insecurity and loneliness. Amnesiacs addresses these fears and allows teenagers to experience these problems by putting you in the shoes of four characters suffering from mental health issues. Our target audience are teenagers, who do not struggle with depression or anxiety. Teenagers with these challenges have a hard time asking for help because people often disregard their difficulties as a part of teenage angst. Therefore, our goal is to build empathy, awareness, and validation for people who do struggle with mental health. We are developing this game in order to raise awareness and provide a medium for people to experience what it means to have these challenges.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/530/530a685f688936e27de41be023ca6340.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gameheads", "SoBright", "mournsky"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
