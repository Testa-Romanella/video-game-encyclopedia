He has the ability to split himself apart and reform himself, which makes him a good candidate for tasks with the other astronauts. Sadly, an accident sent five of his pieces into space! Can you find them all so he can return to normal??</p>\n<p>Use WAS to move (No moving backwards, sorry!) and space to shoot. get 5 points to win.<em>\u00a0Also, there is a glitch that causes your points to say 0 whenever you destroy an asteroid. This is only visual, as the next Mushi you find will return your score to normal. I have no idea why it happens.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Made in the Unity Playground for a school project. Everything but the player character are of my own design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/903/903cf83f759b4ebe3a4f31dc54a20e2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CometCreations"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
