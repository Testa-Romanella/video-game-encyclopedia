{"id": 928391, "slug": "ricocheteer", "name": "Ricocheteer.", "name_original": "Ricocheteer.", "description": "<p>Ricocheteer is a fast-paced, action-packed game that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You take on the role of Rico, a small cube, who is tasked with surviving as long as possible by deflecting enemy bullets back at them. The gameplay is simple and intuitive, but don't be fooled by its simplicity, this game is challenging and requires quick reflexes and strategic thinking.</p>\n<p>To defeat these enemies, you must time your deflects perfectly, so that the bullets are sent back in their direction. Deflecting enemy bullets will also cause them to drop gems, which you can use to purchase upgrades.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ricocheteer was inspired by the\u00a0Juice Jam 2, where the theme was 'Paying The Price', with a focus on creating a 'satisfying/juicy' game. Unfortunately I\u00a0at the time did not have time to enter the jam, but still wanted to make something in the spirit of it later when I\u00a0had the time. This game is the result. Inspired by the theme, every action has a consequence.Time slows down in the game, but when you move, it speeds up, making it even more challenging to dodge bullets and deflect them at the right time. On top of that, every upgrade you purchase will provide a benefit, but it will also come with a debuff. This means that you need to think carefully about when to upgrade, and when to use the gems you've collected to heal yourself, as the only way to regain health is to buy it.\r\n</p>\n<p>To deflect bullets in Ricocheteer, all you have to do is press the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON when a bullet is near. You must aim your deflection by pointing at the bullet using the MOUSE, so accuracy is key. You can also use the WASD keys to move and the SHIFT key to dash, adding even more depth to the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T22:33:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b5/5b543aaf47e04380f2845ac6ecee2c79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Samuwhale"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
