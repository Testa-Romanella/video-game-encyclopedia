To solve each of the <strong>150 levels</strong> you'll learn how to <strong>push</strong>, <strong>pull</strong>, <strong>rubiks-slide</strong>, <strong>defuse</strong>, <strong>mirror-bounce</strong>, <strong>stealth</strong>, <strong>heat</strong>, <strong>freeze</strong>, <strong>climb</strong>, <strong>dig</strong>, <strong>teleport</strong>, <strong>tornado</strong>, <strong>clone </strong>and <strong>sneak</strong>.<br/><br/>Every level has a new idea. Starting simply, you'll soon learn how to use each of the <strong>16 different bonus powers</strong> to manipulate the interactions between the <strong>30 different types</strong> of block. Things slowly get very complicated, especially given that <strong>every level wraps</strong> the top and bottom, left and right of the screen. Fortunately the <strong>hint </strong>system spells out how to complete every level, so you won't get stuck.<br/><br/>Add to that a simple to use <strong>Level Editor</strong>, and a customisable <strong>Random Level Generator</strong>, so there's that...<br/><br/>150 levels are waiting for you...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T03:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d112509b2f47c026b6c968f5837fc085.jpg", "website": "http://www.mazeofbears.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stuart Bray"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Snappy Fingers"], "esrb_rating": null}
