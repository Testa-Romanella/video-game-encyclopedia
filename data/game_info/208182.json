The game is a short, retro-style 2D platformer intended for score-attack and time-attack gameplay.  Certain actions you take in the first level may affect things in the second level.  See how quickly you can finish with a high score!</p><p>For those on Windows, I recommend the downloadable Windows version as opposed to the WebGL version, only because I have yet to iron out the timing of a few of the sound effects in WebGL, making the Windows version closer to the experience I wanted.  Windows version can be downloaded at https://www.dropbox.com/s/kb5gxlewiamny1u/Seasons_Change.zip?dl=0</p><p>Please refer to the ReadMe file for an expanded explanation of the in-game controls and objectives pages.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a37/a37e42464d04d3f6da2c334781165d3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cidermonkee"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
