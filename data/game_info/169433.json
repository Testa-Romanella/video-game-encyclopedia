The object of this game is to get out of a maze inside a planet. The maze is comprised of different rooms, and, more often than not, each room has a monster that you need to avoid. When you come in contact with a monster, or use your jetpack, your fuel level decreases. When the fuel gauge is empty, you will lose one of your lives.
