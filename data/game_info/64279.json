{"id": 64279, "slug": "a-fine-mess", "name": "A Fine Mess", "name_original": "A Fine Mess", "description": "You find yourself on a strange island where the civilization has ended. Up on the sky you see the moon shattered, distant cities destroyed and a mysterious woman in an age-old outfit, biding her time on the beach as if none of it happened.<br/><br/>As you traverse this uncanny surrounding, you start to unravel its mysteries.<br/><br/>This is an impressionist art-game about love and loss, a tribute to our dear friend <strong>Deger Deniz</strong>. In order to piece all the puzzles, you might need to search beyond the game itself.<br/><br/>The game lasts about 30 to 60 mins, depending on how keen you are to find all the secrets and unlock all the achievements.<br/><br/>Music by Cava Grande.<br/><br/>https://soundcloud.com/cavagrande<br/><br/>Follow Santima Games Facebook Page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/santimagames/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4f/a4fc61073508f78fd0b30fe06a261809.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 15}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 304, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Santima Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Santima Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
