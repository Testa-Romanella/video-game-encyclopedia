It's the Friday before a long weekend. \u00a0You've been asked to clean the main mixing room before the next shift begins. They start in 5 minutes so it can't be anything major. As you arrive at the mixing room you're informed that there was a minor incident requiring cleanup. How bad can it be?</p>\n<p><strong>One Minor Incident\u00a0</strong>is the eighth chapter in my <strong>One day at a time</strong> series.\u00a0The series was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:</p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order. <strong>One Minor Incident</strong>\u00a0is based on the 2015 Global Game Jam theme of \"What do we do now?\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:09:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/1271e14560f8cfbc24f1c08e26e3235a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
