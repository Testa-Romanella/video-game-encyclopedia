At the moment it is still in early development, so very little of this is evident.</p>\n<p>It was originally my entry for the RemakeJam (June 19 2017 - June 26 2017), and is rather distantly based on an rpg that I wrote on the ZX Spectrum back in the 1980s. It was essentially an overground rogue-like, although that term didn't exist when I wrote the original, and at the time I hadn't come across NetHack or indeed any other rogue-like. It was a sandbox game, with no specific goal other than to collect wealth and fame, at least as far as I remember.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/2901fb6bd8e7b63f9e0f673b70af54ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chrisatthestudy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
