{"id": 897931, "slug": "lost-seasons", "name": "Lost Seasons", "name_original": "Lost Seasons", "description": "<p>Lost Seasons is a 2D Puzzle Platformer with Metroidvania-like elements. The Player is on an island called Sesona, where the mystical season amulet broke into its four fragments. Fragments are now shattered over the island, causing the surrounding regions to only have\u00a0one season over the whole year. It is the task of the player to re-collect all four seasonal\u00a0fragments and bring back balance to the people of Sesona.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each fragment that has been\u00a0collected gives the player certain powers (e.g. the winter element gives the ability to freeze\u00a0elements). For solving the puzzles in the game, the player has to use these season-fragments\u00a0carefully to advance further in the game.</p>\n\n<p>Part of GDD1 course at TU Graz.</p>\n<p>Game Developers: Michael Baier,\u00a0Husein \u010cau\u0161evi\u0107, Simon Ranftl and\u00a0Ilma Lu\u0161ija</p>\r\n\r\nUsed Third Party Assets\r\n\n\n<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Animated Campfire by krial (modified)\r\n  </li>\n<li>Portals by LetargicDev (modified)\r\n  </li>\n<li>Four Seasons Platformer Sprites by analogStudios_ \r\n  </li>\n<li>Four Seasons Platformer Tileset by analogStudios_ \r\n  </li>\n<li>Burning Crate by devnewton (modified)\r\n  </li>\n<li>Polar Bear Platformer by ZomBCool \r\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sounds</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retro Games Sound FX by Bright Shining Star\r\n  </li>\n<li>RPG Essentials Sound Effects by leohpaz\r\n  </li>\n<li>Street Love - Free Music for Games by Bravewarrior\r\n  </li>\n<li>\r\nBee Sounds from Pixabay\r\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free Pixel Font - Thaleah by Tiny Worlds\r\n  </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T15:00:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/393/3937e640bd9d042050b6ea526fa20c5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Evolus", "LostSeasons"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
