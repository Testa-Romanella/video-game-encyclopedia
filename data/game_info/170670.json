If you want to try to defend the vessels, (they won't last long) it's also an easy way to pull your enemies off of them from across the room. Pulling the hook back to you will also pull all chain links you've created back to you. Any chain links that touch an enemy will become charged, filling \u00a0your soul meter when they are returned to you. Your soul meter will automatically power the shield around you, which will damage enemies that touch you, but will be drained each time it damages an enemy. The soul chain can also pull the soul well to you. Any enemy that touches the soul well, living or dead, is instantly reduced to ash.</p>\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong>\u00a0Firing your hook and chain can be used to pull enemies away from your vessels, skewer and stun enemies in your way, pull the deadly soul well around, and lay down links to charge your shield.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________</p>\n<p>Build to run on PC.</p>\n<p>Built using Game Maker Studio v1.4</p>\n<p>Song used - \"Comfortablement installe-e\" by Monplaisir</p>\n<p>http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Monplaisir/<br/></p>\n<p>Game was made by Nathan Simms.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Taylor for constant support, encouragement, and for finding the music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/807/8070f70f9660a62e983a5e21724b6660.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NayN64"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
