This game is a top-down tense stealth game and it was very exciting to design.  The essential experience of this game was that the main character is an expert thief who sneaks through dark and dangerous locations (which will bring lots of tension) to steal valuables and get out undetected. The gameplay factors of Heist Meisters are that it is a top-down 2D game; there will be a detection element where the detection rises fast and falls slowly. Dark - can switch from normal vision to night vision. I decided to not my make my thief hurt/kill guards because my character is a thief, not an assassin (this game is not Thief or Dishonored). Essentially, my character is a cat burglar because this game is inspired by the board game burgle brothers (a cooperative board game where you assemble a crew, make a plan and pull off the heist).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T04:05:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea4/ea44d7286866491f64bb7bffbe66e889.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
