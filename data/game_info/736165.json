{"id": 736165, "slug": "power-shovel", "name": "Power Shovel", "name_original": "Power Shovel", "description": "<p>Based on Taito&#39;s Japanese arcade game, Power Shovel puts players behind the controls of three earthmovers in a variety of construction-oriented events.</p>\n<p>Three modes of gameplay are available: Arcade King, License Mode, and Level Editor.</p>\n<p>Arcade King includes missions from the coin-op, such as demolishing a car, knocking over houses, and pouring large amounts of curry sauce over rice. Money earned in this mode is used to unlock more mini-games, artwork, music, and other items. Two players can also compete against each other in these events in a best of three competition. Players take turns completing each task until a winner is declared.</p>\n<p>License Mode provides a series of timed tests (like knocking over poles, parking and digging sand) that must be completed in order to gain your operator&#39;s license.</p>\n<p>The Level Editor lets players design their own courses on a 6 x 6 grid, with obstacles such as holes, electric fences, cones, and sheds. The three available shovels vary in their size, speed, capacity, and digging ability. In each event, players have the option of a first- or third-person perspective.</p>\n<p>Features<br />\n<em> Includes missions such as demolishing a car, knocking over houses, and pouring large amounts of curry sauce over rice<br />\n</em> Unlock mini-games, artwork, music and other items<br />\n* Design your own courses on a 6 x 6 grid, with obstacles such as holes, electric fences, cones, and sheds</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T16:32:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ec/5ec089431095d3cbc007c933783d8e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["D3 Publisher", "JVC Digital Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
