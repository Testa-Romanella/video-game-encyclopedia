The game was inspired by the real-life Bosnian War.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>This War of Mine is set in a fictional country Graznavia during an ethnic conflict similar to the siege of Sarajevo. The player controls a group of one to four characters caught in the middle of a war. Each protagonist has a unique set of abilities and weaknesses, some of which are hidden. Their goal is to simply stay alive. It requires them to scavenge food, meds, and other necessary supplies, keep their house warm during the winter and avoid the military. </p>\n<p>By day, the city of Pogoren is filled with snipers who shoot at everyone indiscriminately. The player can explore the city only by night, though it is not safe either, as the characters can encounter hostile looters and marauders. Survival also requires crafting new items from the scavenged junk. One of the most useful items to build is the radio that allows the player to keep track of the events outside. To win the game, the characters have to survive until peacetime which may come at random times.</p>\n<h3>Expansion features</h3>\n<p>The Little Ones expansion pack allows the player to include a child in the group of survivors. It adds a new layer of complexity to the gameplay. The child is helpless and needs an adult to take care of him or her. However, the kid can eventually learn to perform simple tasks, such as cooking. To avoid depression, the child has to assemble new toys from the junk the adults have scavenged and meet other kids to play.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2016-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-24T15:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711a4f90f16e2a07c5e731922ea27ca8.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 3.58, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 75, "owned": 1151, "beaten": 98, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 141, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 312, "suggestions_count": 445, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 314, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Deep Silver"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
