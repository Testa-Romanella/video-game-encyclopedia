This is not a normal plattformer it's a plattformer where you can't jump but instead you change and \r\n\tmanipulate gravity. You play as a robot who is basically looking for a way out of the cave that the game takes place in. On your way through you will encounter various enemies as Skeletons, giant hybrid humans and flying eyeballs. The game was cut short due to lack of passion for the project but i decided to finish and tie it up as it was before I completely lost all passion for the game.
