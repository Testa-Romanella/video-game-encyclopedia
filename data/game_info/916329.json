For humanity this has come in the way of machines. Technology has kept us afloat for millenia, the thumb design in our hands is a mark of evolution we seeked to replicate in machinery with the invention of a dual-thumb design, representing the next great evolution in humanity history. Now not only are we able to grab and hold onto rocks, but even onto something on the scale of an asteroid.... oops. Turns out there is a calamity-level meteor fall coming for our martian colony! Try your dual-thumb hands with a mech and protect humanity, this is your duty as METEORA the star pilot of the planetary defense force!+</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T15:38:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5f/f5f1b44589a2a2c23b4b99d48f081fec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["lila-k", "IDK9", "elektrikid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
