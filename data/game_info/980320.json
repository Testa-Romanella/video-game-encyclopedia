The particles interact with each other through forces, resulting in unique emergent behaviors.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Explore unique artificial universes in 3D or 2D.<br/></li><li> The user interface can be hidden for a more immersive experience. This is also useful if you want to take screenshots or record a video.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Create your own simulations easily with up to eight different particle colors.<br/></li><li> Each particle can exert attractive and repulsive forces on the other particle colors.<br/></li><li> The simulations can be saved to the computer so you can keep the simulations that you find interesting.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Simulations can be randomized which can yield unexpected results and help you discover new artificial life forms!</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Adjust different simulation settings while the simulation is running. The settings can have a large impact on how the simulation evolves!</li></ul><br/><br/>This game uses compute shaders which might not be possible to run on older hardware.
