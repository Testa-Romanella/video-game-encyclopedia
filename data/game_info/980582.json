To repair the station, you need to repair equipment and solve the puzzles. <br/>\r\nBeware of gremlins! They are not dangerous for you but they'll break everything you've repaired so far. They are also a part of a puzzle: you not only need to scare them away but you have to do it the right way!<br/>\r\nThis is a metroidvania based on puzzles instead of battles. You open locations step by step. And you may freely navigate throught the unlocked locations. The station has a vast network of railcars. They will help you to move quickly between its compartments.<br/>\r\nOn some levels you may try different machines: cranes, cable cars, manipulators etc. They may be controlled with special control panels in the bottom right corner. <br/>\r\nSometimes you may see astonishing alien landscape behind the window or occasionally find forgotten diaries and documents in the underground compartments. They will not only help you to go through the puzzles but will also reveal the story behind the abandoned station.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T07:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15c/15cd85e084764343695372792d36cf4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pavel Gorev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pavel Gorev"], "esrb_rating": null}
