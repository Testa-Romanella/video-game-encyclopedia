To rehydrate you need to drag the wine above his mouth, which refills the bar. If the bar empties it's game over. At the same time food approaches GapeJaw, you need to drag his mouth open with your mouse to make it fit around the food's shape. If you are unable to get it around the incoming edible in time GapeJaw will start to choke, which blocks any attempts to drink wine until you clear out the obstruction with butter. Similar to the wine you just need to drag the butter squeezer above his head to clear up your throat.If you succeed in eating an item without choking you'll get the chance to spit out the uneaten remains. If the remains land in the bucket, you get a point.
