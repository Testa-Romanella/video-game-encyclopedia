It is the fifth canonical installment, and sixth main installment, in the Tekken series, marking the tenth anniversary of the series. The game was upgraded to Tekken 5.1, which had mostly balance changes to the gameplay, and later an update Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection which was released for arcades in 2005 and later ported to the PlayStation Portable as Tekken: Dark Resurrection and on the PlayStation 3.</p>\n<p>The game removes several major gameplay changes introduced in Tekken 4, such as uneven stage terrain, in favor of a faster gameplay akin to the older games in the series. It is also the first game in the series to feature the ability to customize characters with accessories, clothing, and other aesthetic items purchased with in-game currency. There are up to 32 characters to choose from, including seven new fighters. The home version includes a mode known as Devil Within, a variant of Tekken Force introduced in Tekken 3. Unlike Tekken 5.1 which merely tried to balance the game, the update Dark Resurrection adds a host of new content, especially in its home version for the PSP.</p>\n<p>Tekken 5 was a critical and commercial success, selling over six million copies. A sequel, Tekken 6, was released in 2007.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2004-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T23:43:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ff8/ff8bdb62481960550013c57025d47812.jpg", "website": "http://www.bandainamcogames.co.jp/cs/list/tekken5", "rating": 4.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 44, "beaten": 161, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 47, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 143, "suggestions_count": 377, "game_series_count": 16, "reviews_count": 143, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["NAMCO"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Namco", "SCEE"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
