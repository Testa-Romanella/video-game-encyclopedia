So keep in mind that it's for educational and study purposes.</p><p>To play, simply click the answer you think is best in order to advance in the story. Also, it's probably best to enter fullscreen.</p><p>Without giving too much away, the point of the game is to make you, the player, conscious of the mechanics of text-based games, forcing you into a different perspective. </p><p>Hopefully by the end of this you'll be thinking about the influence the creator has on the game, the role of the game's narrator, the role of the player, and the agency the player does or does not have in games. Maybe by the end of it you won't just be thinking about this is regards to text-based games.</p><p>I think this is a kind of procedural approach to the subject; the way you're to understand what I mean is through how I designed the game. I even get a little preachy in the end when I try to make my point.</p><p>The most IMPORTANT thing is to have fun!</p><p>I apologize for any typos, misspellings, or any overall mistakes. It's my first game, but I welcome <strong>constructive</strong> critique in the comments below. Or if you just want to say it's fabulous, please go ahead and leave comments like that too!</p><p>Thank you for reading! Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["peppypenguin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
