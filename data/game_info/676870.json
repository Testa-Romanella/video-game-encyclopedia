You play a pirate ship trying to make a living upon the high sea. British Navy ships will spawn to attack you, and Cargo ships will spawn and try to just sail past.<br/><br/>Cannonballs are persistent (and apparently made of styrofoam, since they float), when they've stopped moving any ship can claim them for their own. Each ship has a limited supply of cannonballs, and a maximum number that they can hold. To refill them pick up floating cannonballs (or a cannonball powerup). Be wary of the wind, it can slow or speed you - the colour of your wake will reflect this.<br/><br/>Game Controls:<br/>WASD - Move Ship<br/>Arrow Keys - Shows firing lines while held, fires on release (If Control is held when releasing the shot will cancel)<br/>Spacebar - View Whole Map<br/><br/>NOTE: The Web version of this game used less stable than the Windows version, so if for some reason the Web version crashes - please try the Windows release (if you can). This version is ported from GM1.4 to GMS2, with a couple of minor bugfixes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:12:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1aa/1aa34af02881adcc89fd2c66905642ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Glenugie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
