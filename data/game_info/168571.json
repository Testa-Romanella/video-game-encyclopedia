The goal is simple: create card combinations with the same values.<br/></p>\n<p>To create card combinations, you must increase the value of the cards of your choice. Rapping on a card increases its value by 1. But you only have 4 points to spend, it's up to you! The game ends if you have failed to make a combination.<br/></p>\n<p>With the combinations you make, you increase your score and restore your action points. The longer and higher the value card chains, the more points you earn.</p>\n<p>The principle seems simple to you? It is ! But be careful, the game is much more strategic and deep than it seems.</p>\n<p>Moreover, many special cards, with very different effects, help you to survive as long as possible. Only if you use them correctly of course...</p>\n<p>It's your turn to play! What score will you be able to achieve?</p>\n<ul><li>Completely free</li><li>No ads</li><li>Easy to understand, difficult to master</li><li>Special cards with stunning effects</li><li>English and French</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04e3e096647bdb5e42a1e6fba428f553.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Citron Curieux"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
