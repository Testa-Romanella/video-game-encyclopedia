It has a lot of inside jokes from previous games I made during that class so things that seem out of place are just jokes you don't get (unfortunately). Obviously this is a parody of Dark Souls (one of my favorite games). This was made In Game Maker 8.1 Lite as you will see with the annoying watermark. I hope you enjoy this short souls-like platformer!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Right/Left Arrow = Move</p>\n<p>Up Arrow = Jump</p>\n<p>Z = Attack</p>\n<p>X = Roll</p>\n\n<p>There are some secrets in this game too...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/008/0085fa443f0fb1c66ec25f548d4075d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jake McCarthy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
