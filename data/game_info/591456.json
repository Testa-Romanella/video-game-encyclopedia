You must build ladders, torches,\u00a0 air ventilation systems and more in order to get further and further down.</p>\n<p>Find hidden epitaphs and flowers along the way that you can use to adorn the grave of your lover once you reach the bottom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Monitor your air and health levels carefully because there are no save points and dead means\u00a0<strong>dead</strong>.</p>\n<p>X Feet Under was created for the LDJAM #48 which had the theme\u00a0<strong>Deeper and deeper.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>The game is a first person perspective survival game where<strong>\u00a0</strong>the main loop consists of\u00a0picking up blocks and recycling them to make room to dig further down. Blocks can be deposited into a recycling bin to make room and also to upcycle them into something more useful such as lanterns and air vents, which are needed for the farthest depths.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will find shrines throughout the game where you can leave the urn of your companion, but the best shrines are at the deepest depths. Don't settle!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>X Feet Under uses standard FPS controls (sorry no gamepad support)</p>\n<p><strong>Look:\u00a0</strong>Mouse<br/><strong>Move:\u00a0</strong>WASD<br/><strong>Pick up/Place Block:\u00a0</strong>Left Click<br/><strong>Rotate\u00a0Block:\u00a0</strong>Tab Key<br/><strong>Interact</strong>:\u00a0E Key<br/><strong>Jump\u00a0(hop):\u00a0</strong>Spacebar<br/><strong>Toggle Y\u00a0Axis:\u00a0</strong>Y<br/><strong>Respawn: </strong>Delete</p>\n<p>You can turn the music off by interacting with the radio on the surface</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final\u00a0Thoughts</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Wow,\u00a0 this was a tough LDJAM.\u00a0I loved the theme, but I pushed it right to the end.</li><li>The graphics were intentionally kept simple and I left out shadows to keep WebGL performing.</li><li>I wish I had time to implement some save state functionality - like remembering if you\u2019ve seen a popup.
