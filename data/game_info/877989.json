As in its predecessor, the player's main goal is to get to the top, but thanks to completely new mechanics as well as improved physics, this task should be a bit easier.<h3>Overview</h3><br/>-<strong>New Mechanics</strong><br/>Many new mechanics have been added to the game, like the air current, in which our brave goat can move in 4 directions. Or special rock shelves that she can grab onto to slide down quietly without bouncing off walls. More graphic effects have also been added, for example, the player can choose between two graphic palettes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-<strong>World Exploration</strong><br/>Goat's Tale 2 puts much more emphasis on exploration than its predecessor. At each stage, you can find buried treasures or npc's who will advise you on how to get over the more difficult jumps and drop a penny for their help.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-<strong>Cooperate with friends</strong><br/>The game features an all-new mode that allows you to cooperate together in passing levels. The second player takes on the role of a special helper, who can put up platforms that the first player can jump on, making it easier to pass the game's more difficult stages.<br/><br/><h3>Goat's Tale 2 is:</h3><br/><ul><li> <strong>A new bigger adventure</strong>.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Even more immersive gameplay</strong>.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Great music</strong>.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Fun with friends.</strong>.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Beautiful pixel art graphics.</strong>.<br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Challenge only the best players.</strong>.<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T04:21:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b77/b77eb0fc3ed70668edc5b1628175a5aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FoxSox Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ManyDev Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
