That means you type in commands and the game responds with text, telling you what result your command had in the game world. Do not expect flashy graphics. The action takes place entirely in your own imagination.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is based on a game written by Robert Lee for Antic Magazine back in November 1983. I\u00a0adapted it from Atari BASIC into a console application for\u00a0Vb.net.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n<p>37 years ago, my uncle typed code for a game into his computer from a magazine. It took a few days, but he got it done. Later, my cousin Dale and I tried it out. We were\u00a0lost in a world of action and adventure for days. We made a paper map that covered the entire living room floor,\u00a0and listed where all the special weapons and treasures were located. We figured out the secrets. We had fun, exploring, leveling up, solving riddles, and fighting monsters!</p>\n<p>Fast forward nearly 40 years. My uncle has since passed away. I've become a programmer with an interest in game design. I remembered the fun times we had together and decided to Google the old game. I\u00a0found an emulator version of the original code. I\u00a0found an archived copy of the magazine my uncle typed it out from. So I went to work, re-creating the old game as best I could for anybody from modern times who might be interested in the retro experience.</p>\n<p><strong>ADAPTATION</strong></p>\n<p>I\u00a0had to change a lot from the original code. Some of the game mechanics were just plain silly and frustrating. For example, if your intelligence stat was low, exits from locations would randomly disappear, and you'd have to waste precious moves trying to find your way out of an area with monsters beating the hell out of you. It was not fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So I\u00a0added in a magic system instead. Now you can buy fireball spells and your intelligence stat effects how much damage they do. I also added some quality of life changes. Certain menus were clunky. Hunger and Thirst were more annoying than anything.\u00a0Shopping was a slog and inventory management was bonkers. I also put in an entire potion system so you can buy healing items. The game is far less punishing. You can actually make your way through the world without dying every two minutes.</p>\n<p>NOTE: You may still die every few minutes, but the experience is based on a rogue-like system. You keep XP and get stronger and stronger every time you restart. Just don't run out of food and drink. There are survival elements, too, which was pretty intense for a game from 1983.</p>\n<p>Other than that, the experience is the same. I\u00a0hope you enjoy it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>FUTURE</strong></p>\n<p>I haven't added a Save Game system yet. If you've explored enough, you'll have your map and know where everything is, and you should be able to get through a game in one sitting. I may include saving in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I did all the programming in a few days, and did the play-testing myself. There may still be a few glitches here and there. If you find any, let me know. Otherwise, have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>DISCUSSION BOARD</strong></p>\n<p>I'm adding a discussion board to this game for anybody who's lost and struggling to solve the puzzles.
