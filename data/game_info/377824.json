Here in this guided tour you will find them all, glistening with promise, awaiting the click of your mouse and ready to edutain you! Please enjoy.<br/><br/>Except for <strong>The Button</strong>. The Button is not for you.<br/><br/>. . . . . . . . . . <br/><br/>Interactivity: The Interactive Experience is a short meta-narrative experience about how our interaction with game worlds is limited by convention, in equal parts of awkwardly-funny and oppressive. Explore the gallery in first-person, solve a handful of simple puzzles, and find a way to push <strong>The Button</strong>.<br/><br/>Interactivity was previously released on Itch.io. This remade version has new details, textures, tweaked puzzles, more endings, achievements and haunting music by Miles Tilmann.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-14T20:26:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c18/c18ff6e141e9e4ae964a3fd7ea1b9c4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 17, "beaten": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aetheric Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixeljam"], "esrb_rating": null}
