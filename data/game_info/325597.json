The small but working prototype puzzle has multiple solutions of varying complexity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc8/bc8277c384b3dbdbddbb0a62bb017eba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hwilson"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
