When you pick up a weapon of different type the old one will be discarded.</p>\n<p>Enemies activate when you enter their line of sight. They will also activate any other enemies they see.</p>\n<p>Doors will open automatically when you attempt to walk through them.</p>\n<p>Camera controls: LMB to pan, RMB to rotate, mouse wheel to zoom.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d9272063f919d22b9e5d03128a65a88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["recl"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
