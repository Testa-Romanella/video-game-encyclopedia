This is a reaaaaally short game about our identities online and how our actions in social media can have great consequences. This game was actually just a school project so there's really not that much to see here lol, but if you're into games like Sara is Missing or Simulacra you might want to check this one out(but then again, don't get too excited since the game was put together in roughly 5 days).\u00a0</p>\n<p>To anyone who is wondering, we were suppose to make something artsy related to social media and stuff so since I am sooo quirky I decided to develop a game. Btw, if you can't figure out the password take a look at the game's folder, there should be a text file with the\u00a0 password in it.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T05:31:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ca/4ca7504fc2e1365ef28f2a396775367c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mateus Ikezaki"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
