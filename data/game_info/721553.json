Manage your arsenal using either mouse controls or voice recognition\u00a0- <strong>this game can be controlled entirely via spoken commands</strong>! Simply speak aloud the labels on buttons, or string together phrases to build, inspect, upgrade or sell turrets at a grid's location.</p>\r\nWhat are your orders, sir?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T06:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42a/42aa69fd9e7e95e52d60a7ba36042761.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Haydn Warne"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
