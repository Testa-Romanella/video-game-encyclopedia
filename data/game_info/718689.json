Disasters will strike in increasingly difficult waves of unfortunate events, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Meteors - Defend with baseball bats </li><li>Buildings on fire - Extinguish with rain clouds</li><li>Zombie attack - Fry with a magnifying glass or two</li><li>Alien invasion - Catch and throw flying saucers</li></ul>\n<p>How long will your city survive?</p>\n\n<p>* Virtual Disaster has been developed primarily for the Quest and will be available soon through App Lab. This is for the PCVR version, currently only tested on Quest + Link. Should work well with any Oculus headsets. Support for other versions coming soon.<br/></p>\n\n<p>** We intend to plant a tree through #TEAMTREES for every donation over $5, and two trees for every additional $5 ($10 = 3 trees, $15 = 5 trees, etc). Basically if you want to give us money but hate the environment donate &lt; $5. If you want to plant trees but not give us money go to teamtrees.org. We do not have any official affiliation with Team Trees.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T05:59:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fca/fca4b71ee0b7513d6a7ba5288605a5a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Tree Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
