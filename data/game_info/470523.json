All you need to is left click on any of the yellow or blue blocks to place towers. You have 100 seconds to hold the enemies of before you win the game. Also if you lose all your health you will lose. You will have a limited number of towers. After placing all of them if you click anywhere the first tower you placed will move to that location. In case the font confuses u a bit, you need to press 0 to begin the game. Sometimes however this might not work while you are in full screen view so you might need to exit full screen press 0. If you quit the game from the main menu you might get an error. Just press on OK and leave the game. Remember, you cannot place any towers on the enemy path.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I will release future updates for this game which will include more levels.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thanks and Good Luck playing Space Defender.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In case you love to play FPS games with a bit of horror then this game is for you:-</strong></p>\n<p>https://nikthegreat2020.itch.io/the-living-dead</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T03:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/003/0035bf18c2d53dc945c9bc3032ecb07c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nikthegreat2020"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
