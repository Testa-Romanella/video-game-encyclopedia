Well you found it here!<br/>Welcome to your new summer job as a security guard in the Asylum, an abandoned hospital for kids. While there you notice something strange about the old robots used for surgery. They are decorated with old clown makeup for the sick children, and seem to come alive at night. Your boss warns you that if the robots find you during your shift, they may think you are a patient that needs immediate dissection. <br/><br/>From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night. That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if the robots are moving around, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself!<br/><br/>Can you survive five nights in Asylum?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T03:26:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/2242bc5daaae0f26b217902a41768a55.jpg", "website": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/henry-sorren/id490673725", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Henry Sorren"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Henry Sorren"], "esrb_rating": null}
