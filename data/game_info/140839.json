It's a defense-type game in which waves of Old Idea Zombies, Downer Fish, and, of course, El Glitch, approach you and deplete your attention span (ie. health). You can smack Flying Burgers (yes!!) to gain more health. But be careful, smacking New Idea Fairies spawns more Zombies!</p><p>All art by @TheMeatlly: http://meatlyjam.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aeb/aeb479e7b53742b005b19e56e06e9be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["asleepypenguin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
