I Sure Do!</p><p>Back in 2005-6 it was the first game engine I ever developed on, and predates user friendly development kits like Unity, Lumberyard and Unreal Engine 4 in terms of enabling bedroom coders to make our own games. It was crude, simplistic with a drag and drop editor and segmented 'paint on a grid' walls and floors but it was customizable and its where I learned my craft in terms of variable management, collision meshes etc it taught me a lot.<br/></p><p>I used this Engine from 05-06 til around 2015 where development for this particular game finished.</p><p>I Spent far too many years using FpsCreator to develop games and finally moved onto Unreal Engine 4 around 2017, so I thought I would list it here so not only can people support my future projects if they want to but can also gain an insight into my development History.</p><p>So if you have heard of FPS Creator and always wondered what people could do with it if they tried, or even if you havent and you are just curious and want to support our projects, feel free to toss a couple dollars our way and in return gain access to this rather odd gaming curio from my past!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T05:32:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/678/678f0fa3fee35d5bf2e3bf5fe44d2028.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrumpyMunkyIndy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
