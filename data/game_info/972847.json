Make sure to check out the roadmap below for more information on what's next:<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Build and Expand</strong><br/><br/><br/>In <strong>One Tile Mode</strong> you only have access to a single tile at a time, connecting tiles the right way grants points, points level you up and levels give you more tiles to build with. There is also a <strong>Multiple Tiles Mode</strong>, where you get tiles much faster, and you can also place any of the tiles you have. The <strong>Custom Game</strong> Mode allows you to set your own rules to the game, allowing it to be anywhere from the easiest game you've played, to an impossible challenge.<br/><br/><strong>Unleash your Creativity</strong><br/><br/><br/>If puzzles are not your taste, you can play in <strong>Freebuilding Mode</strong>, where you can build anything you want using all of the in-game tiles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T06:54:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/236878f97babc866df5fd5ff46d9d2d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tiny Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tiny Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
