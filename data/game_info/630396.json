Development took place across just over 2 weeks, and forms the basis of a top-down shooter prototype that I intend to later re-use.</p>\n<p>I developed this game as a gift for my partner on our anniversary, starring our puppy as a protagonist. This is just the initial game jam release and development will continue into the next month.</p>\n<p>===== ===== ===== ===== =====</p>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS</p>\n<p>* There is no handling for player defeat/loss. Please exit the executable if you lose.</p>\n<p>* There is no win condition currently - nothing will happen on defeating every enemy.</p>\n<p>* Game time system is just visual at the moment - nothing will happen on time expiry.</p>\n<p>* Shot audio plays simultaneously for every split shot projectile - it can sound crackly.</p>\n<p>* Under certain conditions you can glitch into the wall if you aim your blink dash beyond the wall.</p>\n<p>===== ===== ===== ===== =====</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>Art and Sound assets largely provided by Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/)</p>\n<p>Space boss battle theme provided by Matthew Pablo (https://opengameart.org/users/matthew-pablo)</p>\n<p>Other development entirely by Daniel Newby</p>\n<p>Developed in Godot Engine v3.2.2</p>\n<p>===== ===== ===== ===== =====</p>\n<p>BRIEF</p>\n<p>Take control of Shrek, a Puppy Time Police cadet who has gone looking for his missing friends, who have gotten lost in various time streams.
