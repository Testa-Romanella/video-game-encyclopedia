{"id": 740316, "slug": "death-wish-maskedintrovert", "name": "Death Wish (MaskedIntrovert)", "name_original": "Death Wish (MaskedIntrovert)", "description": "<p>You play as Kayla, a young high school student placed under a \"Death Wish\" - a curse spread by other students wishing a person dead on a blog site. Sensitive and aware of the deadly curse, Kayla must fight back by trying to purify the curse in her mind... or die trying!<br/><br/><em><strong>The Mechanics</strong></em><br/><br/>Death Wish is based on a board-game design approach. Instead of a steady progress through a story, you're playing short matches on a randomly generated map.<br/><br/>You summon towers and crystals to try to clear a room, and your enemy summons monsters that attack and try to destroy you and your crystals. If you managed to lure them away and keep them away long enough you gain the room and certain advantages. If you manage to control enough of the 'board' you win!<br/><br/>Definitely check out the tutorial in the Single Player mode to get the basics down, then try a few matches to get the hang of it. Multiplayer is lots of fun, so find a friend and try using the \"Host\" and \"Search\" Internet style games for the easiest time connecting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:58:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/569855cf2efe8f2f3a04637a261f5b0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaskedIntrovert"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
