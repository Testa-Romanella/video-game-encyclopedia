Hire 3 Mercenaries and protect Christmas with all your might!<br/><br/><br/>Set in the Year 242 A.R. (Arcane Renaissance) in the World of Vyen. Mayor Nelly of Utania Village has started decorating everything with Christmas lights and pretty stars. She had everyone in the village prepare delicious meals and treats for the holidays, and they planned on celebrating Christmas Eve together as a whole village. But one day, the biggest Christmas hater of them all, Frinch, the Goblin King, threatened Utania Village that he would ruin Christmas and destroy everything. We must protect the holidays at all costs! Thankfully, Mayor Nelly found Mercenaries willing to lend their aid in protecting Christmas and preserving the holiday spirit. Help Mayor Nelly and her friends by forming your Heroes of Christmas to fight King Frinch's army! <br/><br/>But wait, how are we sure that King Frinch is the only adversary to the holidays? What if a certain Lovecraftian lord is yearning to end the festivities? Or a jealous demoness with burning desires to destroy the Goddess' festive creation? Or a mere simpleton who's more than meets the eye, pulling the strings? We will never know unless we fight all of the haters.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Boss Rush Mechanics</strong>:<br/><br/>Generally, most modes follow this setup, except for Jam Mode, which is easier and faster to finish. You face a wave of mobs, then a boss, and afterward, rest at a camp to buy items, talk to your mercenaries, visit your home to decorate or unwind, save, and open the menu.<br/><br/>After completing three sets of mob waves and bosses, you will face the Final Boss. Upon victory, you can claim rewards and unlockables and keep all the Vyse (Gold) and equipment you've acquired. If you wish, you are then taken back to the mercenary select screen to play another round of the game modes.<br/><br/><strong>Visit your HOME to DECORATE and UNWIND</strong>:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Mercenary Types</strong>:\u00a0 As you pick your 3 Mercenaries to battle the Christmas-haters and become Heroes of Christmas, you will be able to pick between three types of mercenaries.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Tank</strong>: Tank-type mercenaries have high survivability to protect themselves and the party. They can provoke enemies to target them in their allies' stead. Their defenses are initially strong, but most tanks aren't fit to deal heavy damage to enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Nuker</strong>: Nuker-type mercenaries are the main damage dealers. They can dish out heavy physical or magical damage to the enemy ranks, but they lack the survivability to protect themselves from enemy retaliation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Support</strong>:\u00a0 Support-type mercenaries are versatile characters who can heal allies HP and MP, give party buffs and shields, and debuff enemies (Depending on the support character's skills.) Their survivability isn't as great as a tank's, and their damage-dealing is not as great as a nuker's, but they're rather decent at both aspects.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Elemental Triangle</strong>: Both players and enemies will have Elemental Affinities (Physical,\u00a0 Force, and Arcane) and will be affected by the Elemental Triangle weakness system.<br/><br/><strong>Get to KNOW YOUR MERCENARIES.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>- Fast-Paced Turn Based Battles<br/>- Home decoration<br/>- Fight Challenging Mobs and Bosses as you progress<br/>- Replayability<br/>- Customizable party combinations and gears<br/>- Unlockables<br/>- Fun Character interactions<br/>- Christmas Spirit is everywhere!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T09:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21c/21c46dc032e3231def29f2f35f501cec.jpg", "website": "https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/heroes-of-the-seasons.163869/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Starmage"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Starmage"], "esrb_rating": null}
