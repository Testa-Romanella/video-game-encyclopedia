Set in Dark Ages England, you will enter the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex during a time of turmoil where you will choose your path and do what you must to make your mark on the world around you, for generations to come.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have the freedom to be who you want and to play the way you want - trader, business owner, worker, landlord, thug, watchman, abbot, and more. The choice is yours.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>SAELIG is a hobby project being developed in my spare time when I'm not at my day job. I love this game and am creating something that I'm proud of and that I enjoy. The Itch.io version of the game is DRM free. SAELIG\u00a0is currently in Early Access which means it is still under development, is not feature complete, and there can be bugs.<br/></p>\n<p>SAELIG is heavily inspired by The Guild 2. So if you're into that you may very well be into this.</p>\n<p>Have questions or need help?
