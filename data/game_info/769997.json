If a werewolf\u2019s power comes from the moon, would being <strong>on</strong> the moon imbue them with an unimaginable amount of selenic energy and make them unstoppable? Basically, we started with a monster and worked backward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As I worked with one of our artists, Liz Allmon, to develop the space station\u2019s layout, I realized that some of my ideas were going to be a little too complicated to execute given the space limitations of a one-page dungeon. So the station became more disc-shaped, and the science behind its gravity changed to something more akin to \u201cdon\u2019t think too hard about it!\u201d I\u2019m still delighted with our end product, and Liz contributed a lot of good ideas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even though I was trying to move away from high-fantasy tropes, I couldn\u2019t totally get away from them. The space station is a mining station operated by, of course, dwarves, so they built a replica tavern to make them feel a little more at home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I rewatched \u201cAlien\u201d to get a feel for how I wanted the werewolf (who we\u2019ve dubbed Space Wulf Daddy in the office) to skulk around the station building tension for the party\u2019s exploration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of different ways to get through this and, really, the werewolf can have his final stand wherever your want. This is where I started writing these to be a little more open-world with options for the party to do different things and travel different paths rather than focus on a linear Point-A-to-Point-B narrative.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T09:14:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdf/bdfb03aad3ade842e15a0d5ebddaad24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Goblins and Growlers"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
