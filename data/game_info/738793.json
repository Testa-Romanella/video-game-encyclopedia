The houses release CO\u2082 (in the web version of the game it shows CO instead of CO\u2082) while the trees absorb it.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>You can play this game completely with your mouse : the right click moves the character, the scrollwheel switches between house and tree and\u00a0the left click places a house or a tree. You can also use '1' to select the tree and '2' for the house.</p>\n\n<p>If you have some suggestions or see a bug feel free to share it in the comments.</p>\n\n<p>Here you can find one of my other games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T06:44:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c58/c58c4930b5f0d28f9c2b03a587466178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Broguld"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
