This is the downgrade of GB Space Jump, which I originally developed in GB Studio 3. But due to a bug that disabled the game to detect collissions, I decided to rebuild and finish this prototype in GB Studio 2. The old (and incomplete) files of the GB Studio 3 version are still available on the original project page.\u00a0So feel free to give it a try.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://hellfansing.itch.io/gb-space-jump</p>\n\n<p>GB Space Jump -2.0 on YouTube:</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p>Motion - (&lt;-) (-&gt;) // [A], [D].</p>\n<p>Jump - (A) // [K]</p>\n<p>Shooting - (B) // [J]</p>\n<p>Use Upgrade - (Select) // [Shift].</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T11:27:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b2732f04e0642364e3f89f63e01151f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hellfansing"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
