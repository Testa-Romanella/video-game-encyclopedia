I did it to play with friends, the awesome Horoscope Zine community on Discord.</p>\n<p>I love Sword &amp; Sorcery and FMX\u2122 is the perfect match for my Shadowlords\u2122 Dark Fantasy setting gaming sessions. It\u2019s easy to learn and play. It\u2019s also brutal and exciting! I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Proofing: Rossi Ant\u00fanez,\u00a0Sean F.
