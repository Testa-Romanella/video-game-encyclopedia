It was my first venture\r\n into the world of game development, created for an \r\nElectronic Game Design competition in high school.<br/><br/>In the game, you control Trollbean. Is he a troll? Is he a bean? These questions, and many, many\r\n others will go unanswered during your quest through the world of \r\nTrollbean. Hop on platforms! Turn red, for some reason! Feed live \r\nbunnies to creatures that are supposed to be bats! Anything is possible!<br/><br/>It\r\n was designed to be completed in under 20 minutes, and if you're good at\r\n games it likely won't take you ten. It was definitely a learning \r\nexperience, and I'm a lot more comfortable with game design now. That \r\nsaid -- some parts of Trollbean are awful awful bad. Some are \r\nsurprisingly impressive for baby's first Game Maker game, though, I think.</p><p>Wouldn't dream of charging for it, but if you want to donate -- you're insane, basically.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6d/d6d385abadcbb9cc7682c448b3104ff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TerminX"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
