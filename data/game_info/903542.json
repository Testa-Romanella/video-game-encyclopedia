Make and release a small game, something I've never done on my own. So after about a week of development here's Breaking in the New Year!! A  short arcade style game where you clear out bricks to help bring in the New Year.<br/><br/>It's a very simple game that I may update in the future with some additional polish, quality of life features, and platforms to play it on.<br/><br/>Until then, I hope you have fun with it and that you have a Happy New Year!!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T11:54:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b1/2b1353359b6b1957375e5babd17a78ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr_Taters"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
