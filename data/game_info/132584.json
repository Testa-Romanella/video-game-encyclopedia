You do this by using your speed and agility to knock the big birds out the sky, or by spitting at them the very seeds they crave for!</p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Simple, clear pixel art graphics.</li><li>Fast-paced gameplay</li><li>Ever increasing difficulty</li><li>Online highscores</li></ul><p>Controls:</p><ul>\n<li>Z - Spit seeds</li><li>X - Dash</li><li>Arrow Keys -  Movement</li><li>Enter - Submit highscore</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b1/5b14536cea812178ebbb117e245e434c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JackOatley"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
