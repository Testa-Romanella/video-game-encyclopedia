Dysfunctional is putting their messy history lightly; more aptly, perhaps, they're a collective failure.</p>\n<p>Thala Wandestinee is destined for greatness. It is a great shame that he will die by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>Confronted by potential change, Em must decide how he thinks the future should be-- or, indeed, whether fate is really what he thought it's always been. All that, with Thala's fate and life in his hands.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbbc5dad36a968fe9ec10c421c5ad742.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["UNICORSITY"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
