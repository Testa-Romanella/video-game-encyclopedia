The pod has very limited movement, so it's up to you to manipulate your surroundings, enabling both you, and the pod to navigate the terrain.<br/><br/>To do this you must use a 'Gravity Gun' type device to utilize many different objects, each with their own properties. One will explode, enabling you to destroy large rocks, kill enemies, or propel the pod into the air. Another one will freeze things, making their movement slower.<br/><br/>Sometimes the pod is a hindrance, other times it's a necessity. At some points you will be split up and forced to take separate routes. But at all times they must work together to get to the end of the mission.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Hidden Objects.<br/></li><li>Unique camera system, looking at the 2D plane from a 3D perspective.<br/></li><li>High resolution, hand drawn graphics, enhanced by super-sampling.<br/></li><li>HDR (on supported TVs).<br/></li><li>Customizable controls.<br/></li><li>Fully voiced dialogue.<br/></li><li>Original soundtrack.<br/></li><li>Designed for a controller.
