Situated on the fringe of the world and without national border security, year after year this nation unwillingly invites countless nomads. Among them is this man, Jinbei Kaname.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25c7\u25c7Game Overview<br/>\r\nWINDSHIFT is a game with elements of both a strategy battle RPG and an adventure.<br/>\r\nNote: Controllers supported<br/>\r\n\u25c7Strategy Battle RPG (Command-Operated)<br/>\r\nBattles are coming your way, triggered by certain events or while you move about the game field. Fight your battles with easy-to-operate commands, and earn experience points and money by defeating enemies. Experience points will advance you to higher stages and let you master powerful lethal moves.<br/>\r\nMake the most of your powerful lethal moves to beat your enemies.<br/>\r\nBe careful though! Using certain lethal moves will drain your attack power (AP), and without it, your probability of successful attacks will dramatically decrease. It\u2019s important that you build a strategy by carefully considering when to use your lethal moves and recovery items.<br/>\r\nAs you proceed with the game, you will encounter characters who will become your companions. The skills they learn are different from the main character\u2019s, so be sure to make the most of the accompanying characters and their powers as well.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25c7Stores<br/>\r\nYou can obtain recovery items at town stores and village stores. Stock up frequently on these items so that you can fight battles with the upper hand against formidable enemies. Items may also be found within treasure chests in other places such as dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25c7Adventure<br/>\r\nThe adventure scenes of this game are fully voiced in Japanese with English subtitles. The adventure part alone is over 2 hours long in total. Be sure to immerse yourself in our world of extraordinary stories, brought alive by Japan\u2019s first-rate voice actors.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25c7Game Length<br/>\r\nThe average length is approximately 20 hours, which may look rather short, but this game has plenty of features to satisfy all kinds of completionists. We hope this game will be an addition to your long-time favorites.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25c7End Credits<br/>\r\nTheme Song: \u00abSuisei (Comet)\u00bb<br/>\r\nPerformed by Saya Horigome<br/>\r\nWritten, Composed and Arranged by KUM+<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u25c7character voice acter<br/>\r\nJINBEI KANAME\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbKIYOMASA ITOU<br/>\r\nSUMIRE HIMA\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbYUZU NAYUKI<br/>\r\nOHATSU \u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbSAYA HORIGOME<br/>\r\nRANKA\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbASUKA ITOU<br/>\r\nENGO \u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbTATSUNORI FUKUSATO<br/>\r\nPHOENIX\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbKAZUKI YOKOTA<br/>\r\nCHIGUSA\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbSAWAKO SHIRAKABE", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0e/b0e26c14e52cb39e3db8079f214ff132.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/BladeWindshift", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["REAL"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["REAL"], "esrb_rating": null}
