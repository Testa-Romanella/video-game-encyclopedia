The inspiration behind the project was to discover how to create a proceduraly generated\u00a0dungeon.</p>\n<p>The game was designed to be modular, so that anyone who has the project files can easily add new rooms, bosses, and items.</p>\n<p>When creating this game my goal was to first explore melee based dungeon crawlers. My personal goal was to build tools for myself in order to make development easier in the long run. As it stands there is a base enemy script that all enemies derive from, a base item which can be edited to apply different buffs and debuffs, and a system that allows for an editor to easily add more room pools, and rooms to each pool.</p>\n\n<p>Key Features:</p>\n<p>Procedural dungeon generation</p>\n<p>Item pools of varying rarities</p>\n<p>Room pools to dynamically change difficulty\u00a0on floor generation</p>\n<p>Rooms designed to accommodate\u00a0melee oriented gameplay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd3/bd3671c2139fab874e725207d919d3f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["water_kelpi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
