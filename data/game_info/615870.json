Person vs. person, person vs. self, person vs. fate, and many more.\u00a0But now,\u00a0 the ultimate conflict can be resolved: person vs. pit!</p>\n<p><em>Pit Brawl</em> is a local multiplayer endless runner where one player is the person and the other controls the pits that person must avoid. It was made in\u00a0Construct Free Edition as a game design exercise, and stylized after the sort of super amateur and\u00a0unpolished but also super unique and inventive\u00a0flash games you could only find on the 2000s-era Internet.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Pit Brawl</em> is a two-player game only. (I mean, you could\u00a0<em>technically</em> play it by yourself, but you'd be playing both roles and that's not nearly as fun, is it? So playing with a friend is highly recommended.)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Aidan\u00a0Andreasen ...\u00a0Program</p>\n<p>Aaron\u00a0Vuong ...\u00a0Art</p>\n<p>Kunal\u00a0Chandel ...
