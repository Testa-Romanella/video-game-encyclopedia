{"id": 172943, "slug": "come-together", "name": "Come Together (itch)", "name_original": "Come Together (itch)", "description": "<p>COME TOGETHER is a multiplayer game about communication and innuendo played over two computers.</p>\n<p>When zones on your screen glow or become not black, they are ACTIVE and can be CARESSED with the cursor to feel pretty good and have your pleasure bar fill up. The faster a zone is caressed, the faster the bar fills up.</p>\n<p>However, the cursor on your screen is controlled by the other player\u2019s mouse. Your own cursor is on their screen.</p>\n<p>Communicate with each other to figure out where to move your cursor and where you need to caress.</p>\n<p>Try to reach maximum enjoyment at the same time!\u00a0</p><p><strong>UPDATE 24/01/18:\u00a0</strong>More refined art from Pewka Zilla.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>COME TOGETHER was created over 48 hours as part of the #Heartbeat18 game jam, run in Byron Bay by Blushbox Collective. We wanted to explore ideas of communication and navigating/exploring bodies in intimate moments with a game that would also just be lighthearted and really funny/awkward.<br/></p>\n<p>Mahli-Ann Butt (@MahliAnn) - Design, Art, Academic diagnosis</p>\n<p>Pewka Zill (@PewkaPew) - Design, Art, Music</p>\n<p>Cuauh Moreno (@oddgoo) - Design, Network programming</p>\n<p>Brendan Keogh (@brkeogh) - Design, gameplay programming</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:</p>\n<ul><li>Joining games is a tiny bit of an obtuse process. Refer to the README file for getting it setup. Comment here if you have any troubles!</li><li>Probably a good idea to make sure both players run the game at the same resolution so your friend can reach all your zones.\u00a0</li><li>If you're running the game on Mac, the game is best played in Windowed mode rather than full-screen. Otherwise your cursor sometimes reappears on your own screen and it's very confusing.</li><li>There is a giant alien bug in the game, and we know about it.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da4/da4634ef3b95d932fb00080c706782a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
