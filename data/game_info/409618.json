Obtain a growing and selling license and sell that weed to make cash and slowly but surely rise to become the owner of the whole street.<br/><br/>Buy and renovate dilapidated buildings to launch businesses, hire staff and make even more cash. Expand and upgrade those businesses to grow your cash stack and become richer and richer.<br/><br/>But never forget your roots. Grow weed and make edibles in your upstairs grow-ops. Expand and upgrade those grow-ops and the weed hungry customers looking for medicinal or recreational marijuana will flock to your street in great numbers.<br/><br/>It is not all going to be carefree though. Cops will stop by to check your license, gangbangers will want a piece of your success and wreck your shops. If you stop and just rest on your laurels you will be eaten alive. Never stop growing.<br/><br/>And once the street becomes too small of a playground for you, expand to other streets and slowly take over the whole world!<br/><br/>Jah be with You.
