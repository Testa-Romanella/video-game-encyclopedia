He's haunting the best bar in town, and it's time for him to leave.</p>\n<p>Use your accordion to challenge him to a duel. Mimic his melodies to stay alive. Harmonize with his guitar to send him into the depths.</p>\n<p>Use A, S, D, F to play notes assigned to you as they cross the bar. Harmonize through the all 3 choruses\u00a0to win.\u00a0Make more than 5 mistakes and you're toast.
