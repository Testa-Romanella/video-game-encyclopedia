It was made using rpgmaker mv! You can play it in browser, or download MAC and WINDOWS builds to play on your own computer.</p>\n<p>The game takes a minute to load when you first start it up! When the RPGMAKER logo pops up, you are good to go. If it does not, try closing it out and loading it back up again!</p>\n<p>Very proud of this game, and very grateful to the folks on the team!<br/>-r</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T04:44:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/254/2548e962d2b7cc6864fc855e93dc7fac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Ruune"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
