Tired of superficial and problematic modern social media, we wanted to create a more wholesome and conversation-focused platform.\r\n</p>\n<p>Bzl App allows users to make short-lived posts categorized with keyword tags, creating an ever-changing feed of content. With the ability to sort the feed using Hives, users can display only posts relevant to their interests. Other features include commenting, avatar customization, and boosting posts to increase their lifespan.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the future, we plan to add more game-ified elements such as user points and a shop where users can purchase items to display in their rooms. Sending gifts is also on our list of upcoming features.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>[IoS/mac currently not supported]</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T17:09:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/151/15177a58206559827bb4df643f413431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["azakaela"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
