The most notable of these features being animals; the lack of animals means that there is no need to craft weapons as there is nothing to fight.</p>\n<p>Goal:</p>\n<ul><li>Due to not having time to finish the ending I planned,\u00a0the goal is to survive as long as you can.</li><li>Keep yourself alive by keeping the hunger bar (green), thirst bar (blue), and the health bar (red) above 0.</li></ul>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Crafting Items</li><li>Day &amp; Night Cycle</li><li>Melee Weapons + Bow &amp; Arrow</li><li>Procedural World Generation</li><li>Cook meat over the fire</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to\u00a0Move</li><li>Shift to run (care your get hungry!)</li><li>Mouse to look around</li><li>Tab to Open Inventory</li><li>Mouse 1 to use the tool in your hand.</li><li>F to interact with objects</li><li>Click on the crafting icons to craft and the icons of food to eat them.\u00a0\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>I\u00a0had a lot of fun working on this game and proud of it from a technical aspect; I might continue developing it in the future.
