Then the server moderators put the scene together to be released on Halloween. This project is not quite a game, but more so\u00a0meant to be a showcase of different work, skills, and art styles by the members of the server. It was also meant to be a\u00a0way for each person to challenge themselves with something a bit different than what they're currently working on.</p>\n<p><strong>Many thanks to all of the participants!</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Ann</li><li>Spacenomad</li><li>Andy Bae</li><li>Pinballkitty</li><li>Mac</li><li>Cyan</li><li>Spoonie</li><li>acid</li><li>OceanDeep</li><li>GameDevKyle</li><li>croak</li><li>Asix Jin</li><li>Jonathanian</li><li>Snuti</li><li>mutilateddragon</li></ul>\n<p>And much gratitude and appreciation to Ryan and Simon for their contributions to the project. Ryan did some magical scripting, environment setting, ghost integration,\u00a0UI, and got the gravestones bopping to the music. And it was Simon who composed the spooky tune you hear in the game! So many thanks to both of you &lt;3</p>\n<p>All non-ghost assets are from the magical Kenney.nl</p>\n<p>As for me (Julia) - I did the level design, player controller,\u00a0and finishing touches on the scene. And I hid a little easter egg in there too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you like it!\u00a0And if you're interested in joining the Game\u00a0Dev Friends Club or participating in the 100DaysofGameDev challenge, you can find more information about it here :)</p>\n<p>Much love, happy Halloween, and\u00a0happy devving!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:19:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/286/28611c68633bc416f65ce39ddd21cf46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Julia"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
