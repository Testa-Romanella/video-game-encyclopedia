Sorry not sorry. There is a clue or two though.<br/>Just so you American folks have a chance at the clue, remember that a \"full stop\"\u00a0is a period.</p>\n<p>By the way, when a link is a different colour it only means that it goes to somewhere you've been before.</p>\n<p>This story was made as a Christmas present for my little sister some years ago (I was using the Harlowe Twine format, that's how long ago it was). It was the first game I ever finished (actually a branch or two of the story were unwritten at the time I finished it, which I recently wrote into the story, and apparently one branch was chopped off by criss crossing backup files and had to be replaced, and I added some audio at the end, if you can find it).</p>\n<p>It turns out that this story, when you count all the branches, has almost twice the word count of my little book.</p>\n<p>If you find these games interesting,\u00a0I would certainly appreciate any\u00a0little support by way of Patreon!</p>\n<p>God be with you!</p>\n<p>Your servant,<br/>Patrick</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905c5945ee6d9825aea98c36d0d3f714.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["patrick-lauser"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
