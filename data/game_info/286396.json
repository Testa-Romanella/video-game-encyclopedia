The idea is that the tank the player controls\u00a0\u00a0overheats when it takes damage or when\u00a0the player shoots\u00a0too much, resulting in glitching all over the screen, less accuracy when firing\u00a0and ultimately death.\u00a0I was heavily influenced by Vlambeer at the time, especially their lost project\u00a0Glitchiker (link:\u00a0www.youtube.com/embed/P1h95LNDjw8), and I'm proud of the aesthetic of the prototype. The gameplay itself is nothing revolutionary, and the glitching kind of makes it terribly hard not to die once you are near death, but it was super fun to work on.</p>\n\n<p>The excellent sound effects and music was made by my dear friend Martin Kvale.\u00a0He elevates everything he works on by a mile, and he did a great job on this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T04:14:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d0/5d0d390c5b82b8225c7529dd70b78faf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Krisjet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
