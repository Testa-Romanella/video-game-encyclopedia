Each turn looks like this:\u00a0\r\n1) Shop\u00a0new monsters.\u00a0\r\n<p> You can buy as many as your bank will allow. You can arrange their formation by dragging them using your mouse around the spawning grid.</p>\r\n2) Fight\u00a0with your monsters.\u00a0\r\n<p>Or more like, let them fight for you as this is an auto battler.</p>\r\n Get emotional\u00a0as you see mayhem unfold.\u00a0\r\n<p> Maybe all your units died. Maybe some survived and are getting ridiculously faster. Maybe you forgot to buy units and are happy to find out that you gained some money to spend on better monsters next turn.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<strong>Axel Nordanskog</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>programming<br/><strong>Dino Liki\u0107</strong>2D art<strong>Erik Mans\u00e9n</strong>programming<strong>Markus Grejer</strong>Roman consultant<strong>Thea Carlqvist</strong>programming\r\n<p>with assistance from<br/></p>\n<strong>Jacob</strong>\r\nprogramming<strong>Valdemar Wadstr\u00f6mer</strong>3D art", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T08:16:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/746/7464761284e9f134f47dbc7a52b5bf43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Axerosh", "Ethamerax", "Iridescene"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
