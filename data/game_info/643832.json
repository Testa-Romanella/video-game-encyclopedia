If you get hit, you have to 'blow off steam' by playing a platformer game\u00a0at your phone. When playing on the phone the timer will count down. If you manage to pick up the heart in time, you'll live. You can also find a power-up on every platformer level. Possible power-ups are damage (big bullet), shorter reload time (three bullets) or a shield.</p><p>I forgot to put this in the credits, but the TV shader was made by\u00a0leon4aka from godotshaders.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T05:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cb/1cb8a7aae4517db51a4d58e05a51ead5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Meehaww"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
