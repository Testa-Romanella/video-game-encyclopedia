Collect items that tell a rich history and follow along as the farmer discovers his true purpose as a key character in this world's epic tale.<br/></p>\n<p>This is the first chapter in the Tales for Erda saga.  It is meant to be played in under thirty minutes and gives the player a good foundation for where the next Tales from Erda game starts off.  Dungeon Fall is the perfect introduction to this world where everyone is not a hero, but has a purpose.</p>\n<p>All proceeds of Dungeon Fall will go to the currently-in-development The Darkspeaker's Prince, which is the next game in Tales from Erda.
