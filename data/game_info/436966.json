As always I wanted to have witty dialogue and absurd situations. You shoudl move on a map, point your gun at different people to keep them in check, or keep your gun down if they so wish. Then i got the glorious idea to make a card game out of it to add more replay value and randomness to the game. Unfortunately that was the beginning of the end. The dialogue must be written in a way, that dont really depends on the items you have, like a gun or not a gun, but on a system taht uses card values that determine your answers when speaking. Eg: a gun ist threatening, a coffee is a friendly gesture. Sometimes the dialogue can acknowledge your items decision and uses the items name in the text dynamically. The goal was, to choose your card packs like police badge, gun and coffee and try to solve the situation. You should have been able to use the coffee either as a friendly gesture or to throw it at your enemy.All depending on your previous choices. That didnt work out, because the delayed impact of your cards, resulted in being relly friendly while trying to use the gun etc<br/>Writing these systems took way too much time and i think are inherently flawed. Nevertheless would i like to persue this system and eventually make it work, with or without cards.<br/>On the plus side, im really happy with the images. card movement and the little bit of dialogue there is. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T05:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bffb6191de94d80868183303fdab41cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ancientpixel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
