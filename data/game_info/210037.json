It is <strong>played in rounds </strong>versus an AI.</p><ul><li>Each round you and the AI <strong>place a bet </strong>of one coin. </li><li>You go first, and <strong>roll  dice</strong>.</li><li>At first you roll 2 times. Then you decide if you want to add, subtract, multiply or divide the rolled values to <strong>calculate your preliminary score</strong>. (Note that you can only select the division if the calculation does not give a rest. E. g. 6 divided by 2 is ok, but you cannot choose division if you rolled 5 and 2.)</li><li>Then you roll 3 more times. After each roll you select one of the remaining operators: <strong>plus, minus, multiplication or division</strong>.</li><li>If the division was not chosen before the last roll it will get chosen then, and a possible rest simply gets ignored.</li><li><strong>Then the AI </strong>places its bets, rolls and chooses operators.</li><li>Whoever has the <strong>highest score </strong>at the end of the round <strong>wins the bets</strong>.</li><li>You <strong>win </strong>if the AI loses all coins, and <strong>lose </strong>if you lose all coins.</li></ul><p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cd/3cd9f1b2d45d01eaaefa4d4a43a25c26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Jireugi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
