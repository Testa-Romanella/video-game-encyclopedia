Designed by the legendary Hideo Kojima, it spawned a huge franchise in stealth gameplay and is considered one of the top games from the platform. While there are ports for the NES, Spectrum and C64 they were missing a lot of the key details from the original game. An Amiga version was once advertised in a magazine but sadly was consigned to myth and legend. That is until now.<br />\nBased on a full and commented disassembly by Manuel Pazos of the original MSX2 game cartridge, this Amiga port has been built to ensure as near a perfect conversion as possible. Gameplay elements remain intact while additional features have been layered on-top to ensure the fullest experience possible of Metal Gear on the Amiga.<br />\nCode ported from Z80 to 68000 assembly by Hoffman<br />\nGameplay adjusted to work at full 50hz/60hz<br />\nNo slow-downs or sprite flicker<br />\nMultiple game modesEnglish Remix Fan Translation<br />\nOriginal European Version<br />\nOriginal Japanese Version<br />\nNew Spanish Translation by Akira<br />\nEnhanced Amiga Soundtrack and SFX by Hoffman<br />\nOptional emulated MSX / PSG Music and SFX<br />\nFull support for CD32 gamepad for keyboard-less gameplay<br />\nAdditional character graphics by Toni Galvez<br />\nAll new ending / credits section<br />\nFor any Amiga with 512kb Chip Ram + 512k Other Ram<br />\nBootable disk image for low spec Amigas<br />\nWHDLoad installer by Psygore</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T10:07:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a51/a5176f4bf129fa5d50db5300e93f1f0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["h0ffman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
