It all started when they set up that oil refinery near your island. This must not stand! Banding together with your fellow Pengs, you'll travel around in your Peng Base and lead your feathered friends to victory across 10 levels. But be careful \u2014 chasing power may come with a hidden price...</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Spawn Pengs from your base and control them across the map to fight off waves of enemies. When you kill an enemy, you'll be rewarded with any fish they were carrying, which can be used to hire more and stronger Pengs to fight for you! Defeat all the enemies in a level to win, but don't let them destroy your base!<br/></p>\n<p>The last level you completed is saved. When reopening the game, you'll start from the beginning of the next level.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move your cursor.</li><li>X to select a Peng or confirm an option on the menu.</li><li>Z to cancel.</li><li>Enter to open the pause menu, letting you move to the next day.</li></ul><p><strong>Other Credits</strong></p><p>Gizmo199 created the font used in the game.
