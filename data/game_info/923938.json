You create lines that the ball can bounce on, and make sure that the ball doesn't fall down or hit the side of the screen. Occasionally, red lines will spawn that you have to avoid using unique line placement to survive. If the ball hits the red line, GAME OVER! Game was inspired by Dafluffypotato's Lynez game and completely made in python using the library pygame.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T11:10:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a3/7a3b8d27e83e0aa86185af6acd4c8a59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MysticalPiano"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
