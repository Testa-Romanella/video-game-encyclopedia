As it was my first Jam I\u00a0definitely learned a lot but bit off a bit more than I\u00a0could chew, and had life interfere with the scheduled development time. I would love to return to this concept and finish my initial idea, and if I\u00a0find the time I\u00a0will document that progress here.</p><p>** DEVELOPMENT BREAKDOWN TO COME **</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T05:00:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f7/2f72da667dc812782a11a3e7d17daa00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cainrodgames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
