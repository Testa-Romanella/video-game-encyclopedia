The game was made around a cooperative experience, one person controlling the knight and another\u00a0controlling the sprite, but can also be played solo. The idea of the knight is being the brunt of the party, being able to fight enemies and act as the main player that moves between stages, while the sprite is the helper that opens pathways for the knight by adding and removing spirit blocks. The game uses custom scripts for the player and level movement,\u00a0and Unity's grid-based tile system for level creation built by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc3/fc3696e643b77013d1e25f05829a878c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SolarSnowball"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
