You're also equipped with an inventory of spells. Apply these spells to the towers to create some extremely overpowered monstrosities.</p>\n<p>Careful, though, your towers are just as deadly to yourself as they are to your enemies. So make sure not to go *too* overboard, otherwise you'll just get yourself killed.</p>\n<p>And finally, make sure to light the torches in each room, unless you want the enemies to become more powerful. Each torch is only active for 10 seconds, so make sure you can path between them to keep them lit.</p>\n\n<p>Font is VT323.</p>\n<p>Music by Juhani\u00a0Junkala!</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action\u00a0&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T06:35:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6dba78f6d6f28d02482b46ec821b151.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["puddlepep"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
