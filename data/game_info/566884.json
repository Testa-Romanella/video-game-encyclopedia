{"id": 566884, "slug": "dr-rogers", "name": "Dr Rogers", "name_original": "Dr Rogers", "description": "<p>In my short story Dr. Rogers, I wrote I feel like I tried to depict many different things in the story. I came up with the story after putting several different factors, but I wanted his powers to relate to things that people do every day, in my case I talk to my dog every day. The thought I had behind it all was, what if I could actually drink talk to animals and then have super strength to do things I can\u2019t on top of that. I didn\u2019t want my characters powers to be overpowered like I could have, I made him fairly balanced and able to fit in with ordinary people.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I came up with the want because every superhero wants some kind of normal lifestyle and many can\u2019t have that. While on the other hand the world needs him to stop the evil in the world. When the evil comes to find him and take his power, he finds out his and the worlds needs overrule his wants. His wants and needs differ because they are opposite of each other. While on one end he wants to use his powers minimally, but he needs to use them to not only save the world but save himself.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are around a half dozen decision points and branches in the story that can either change the path of the story or find out more about Dr Rogers. I did it in this way because you are essentially building your own story and building a different type of character to be able to get towards the end of the story. These decisions take place starting from the beginning of the story to the end and I created multiple stages of decisions that affect the decisions from stage to stage.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I came up with the story beats that made stage to stage make sense by using the bottle technique. Where the story started in a single lens it then expanded to paths, I wanted to give the reader options as feel like they are in control of their story. The main thing that I wanted to stay consistent throughout the story is to both have a good and a bad choice as they advanced, which even at times didn\u2019t stay consistent. At the very beginning where Dr Rogers is having flashbacks both for example, both of the paths have negative paths because they his path wasn\u2019t necessarily good which leads him to where he is now in both real time and in the story.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I tried to show the readers interests by giving them options between paths. They could choose the right paths to a happy ending where the main character prevails, and everything works out right. Or the other paths which have different endings which all can be bad or loop around to being good. I made sure to leave options open, but with a majority of the passages and paths in the story the player has the option to go back to fix a decision they may or may not like.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, the story itself gives the player many different paths or options that even at time overlap others. Through all these it is meant to appeal to a very sad and sadistic series of events that led him to the place he is now but gives Mr. Rogers the opportunity to both prevail and fail.\r\n</p><p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T07:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d25e63a350e06a77cae754ed557738f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheTrinity10"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
