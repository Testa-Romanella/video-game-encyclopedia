The levels of the game will teach the user individual German words in an entertaining way. \"</em>\r\n\ud83e\ude84 Learn the secrets of the wasteland \ud83e\ude84\r\n<p>In Spellcaster, players take on the role of a young dwarf on a journey of adventure through the wasteland accompanied by a fairy. Each level involves using magic to solve puzzles, interact with objects, and use or combine items. Along the way, the player will encounter various, mostly peaceful creatures.</p>\r\n\ud83e\ude84The days of oblivion are over \ud83e\ude84\r\n<p>In the Age of Oblivion, 4610 years after the Second Chaos War, the dwarves of Gamm Moggulir begin to reclaim the wastelands to the north of New Mora. They do not get very far, however, as the wasteland is barren and contains few visible resources. These uninhabited lands have been used primarily as a testing ground for dwarven experiments and inventions, but in recent years expeditions have uncovered the remains of a lost and forgotten civilisation.</p>\r\n\ud83e\ude84Get to know a new language \ud83e\ude84\r\n<p>Each level represents its own lesson in different German words. The first time the player interacts with an unfamiliar object, a quiz interface opens. The user can choose from four different words. If the correct German translation is chosen, the object can be interacted with. After completing a level, a kind of vocabulary trainer starts automatically. In a test, the correct German translation has to be assigned to the English words learnt in the level.</p>\r\n\ud83e\ude84Controls\ud83e\ude84\r\n<p>The player can control the entire interface and gameplay using a mouse. This simple control scheme is designed to allow the game to be played quickly, even by users with limited motor skills and movement.</p>\r\n\ud83e\ude84The Team behind Spellcaster\u00a0\ud83e\ude84\r\n\n<p>The game was created by Team Spellcaster, a group of students from the SRH Hochschule Heidelberg.
