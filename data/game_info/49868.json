Instead the game was developed by Traveller&#39;s Tales and published by Universal Interactive Studios.<br />\nThe story begins when we see Dr. Neo Cortex&#39;s space station and Uka Uka awakes the Destructive masks who each have a power over Earth, Fire, Water, and Air.  If they unleash their power then Cortex will be able to power his secret weapon which could be capable of crushing mountains, demolishing entire cities, and even destroy Crash.  Crash with the help of his sister Coco Bandicoot and Aku Aku need to find a way to stop Cortex and the destructive masks before Cortex&#39;s weapon is powered.   The Wrath of Cortex is the first game to feature Crunch Bandicoot, one of Cortex&#39;s creations who turns good by the end of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-27T15:08:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/01448cb1ddc74e6a2bf032c4ffc7922e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.81, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 39, "beaten": 84, "toplay": 20, "dropped": 31, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 73, "suggestions_count": 460, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 73, "platforms": ["GameCube", "Xbox", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Traveller's Tales"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Vivendi Universal Games", "Vivendi Games", "Universal Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
