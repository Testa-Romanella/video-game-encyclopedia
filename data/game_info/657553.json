The world has descended into chaos. A company you work for has developed a drug that can temporarily prevent people dying from the infection and becoming zombies. This could be a game changer. You need to transport the drugs across town to a military base. But your truck crashes so you need to protect it until reinforcements can arrive and help you.</p>\n<p>There is a turret sequence where you must protect the base using a high tech military turret.</p>\n<p>-- A build taking up less storage will be posted soon ---</p>\n\n<p>This game was created in about 6 days for the brackeys 2021.2 game jam. I worked solo on this game all code and art is by me.
