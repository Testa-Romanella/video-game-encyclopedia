They can't do simple math\u00a0correctly, they cut costs by not using necessities (bolting beams together) and they have truly idiotic innovations (making\u00a0floors out of Balsa wood). The beams and floors they have used on their recent projects haven't been secured properly,\u00a0i.e. they're quite ***Unstable***. The beams and flooring they installed in a moronic layout will fall after they take\u00a0on weight (you step onto them). The differences between difficulty\u00a0levels are noted below.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Levels</strong>:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Level 1 - Intended to be atop an under construction high-rise in the city,\u00a0 it\u00a0ended\u00a0up being floating beams in the clouds.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Easy </em>- Beams fall 10 seconds after contact.</p>\n<p> <em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Medium </em>- Beams fall 6 seconds after contact.</p>\n<p> <em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Hard </em>- Beams fall 3 seconds after contact.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Level 2 - Above water and adds new elements such as floor pieces and vertical\u00a0beams.</p>\n<p> <em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Easy </em>- Beams fall 10 seconds after contact.</p>\n<p> <em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Medium </em>- Beams fall 6 seconds after contact.</p>\n<p> <em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Hard </em>- Beams fall 3 seconds after contact.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong>:</p>\n<p> The theme \"Unstable\" can lead to a lot of different ideas. It could be an unstable person, unstable climate / weather,\u00a0unstable structure, etc. I went with the latter of those ideas and was off to an ambitious start (3.5 hours late). I did\u00a0what I could and learned a ridiculous amount in the process. I learned that I simply can't create audio via SFXR and Audacity.\u00a0So for the first time in 5 years I busted out my acoustic guitar! I got super creative with SFX and menu background, general art,\u00a0menu background, etc. At first it seemed daughnting, but all in all, 48 hours is actually longer than you would think.\u00a0I wish I had spent more time in the past 2 days creating a better game by adding more levels and adding more to the\u00a0construction theme, making more of a variety of unstable objects.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T07:08:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51f/51f838b295386fa428ab8a62c2a1865f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flubek"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
