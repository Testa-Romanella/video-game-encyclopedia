What Heracles 2 does is basically take the game engine behind Dragon Warrior 2, improve the graphics, add a dash of Greek Mythology and mix it all up. Sure, maybe the geography isn\u2019t quite right (Athens and Minoa, on the same landmass? Where\u2019s Crete?), and maybe some of the mythology is a bit off\u2026 but hey, it\u2019s a game. It doesn\u2019t have to be real. If I wanted it to be that real I\u2019d read an atlas and check out the Mythology section of the library. What it is, is FUN\u2013and that\u2019s what counts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-01T09:40:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1a8/1a8ad54dd151bf5c12a473d03474eae5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Data East"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Data East"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
