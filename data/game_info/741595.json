Yes, this is a story about poop, and farts, and idiotic, pointless adventures, in fact, the whole adventure will be a pointless adventure, but maybe it will be fun...?<br />\nInvestigate the world, meet weird characters, stop the evil plot of a mad genius, unlock Poop vehicles to reach new islands, level up and get better equipment, farm a little, fight secret bosses if you want, and if not, don&#39;t do it!</p>\n<p>&quot;This sounds very dumb.&quot;</p>\n<p>Look, kids are all like &quot;haha fart&quot; and &quot;haha poopy!&quot; okay? Don&#39;t judge the creativity of a kid, griw! It may look like a very dumb game, but there&#39;s a lot of work, time and soul put on it and I really tried my best to tell an interesting story.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-20T23:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/834/834c09861a7fe07a979ece0115bd1ed3.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/12005/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
