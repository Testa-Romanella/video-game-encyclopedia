This was my cousins first game jam (and he rocked it!) and it was amazing to be able to develop something together.\u00a0 The game has it's flaws, but we learned a lot, and we're happy that we have a playable game (if not a bit buggy) with a start, game loop, and end.</p>\n<p>We called it \"Git Good\" to pay respect to the struggles we had in our own \"Stuck in a Loop\" experience using Git to collaborate.\u00a0\u00a0Neither of us had used Git before, and we really were thrown for a loop (for a good part of the first day) before we could figure it out.\u00a0 It's also a nod to the challenge of this 5 level game, which requires some skill to beat.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>tl;dr<br/></strong><strong>Git Good Dungeon </strong>- Our Hero is 'stuck in a loop' in a dungeon, where in each loop the enemies spawn in the same position (the loop), but with each iteration more get added.\u00a0 Green Fireballs helps boost the challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Attack (Mouse Left)</li><li>Roll\u00a0(Mouse Right)</li><li>WASD (Movement)</li><li>Kill the Skeletons, Avoid their Attacks, Fireballs hurt</li><li>Escape Key (Quit)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Bugs</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Probably lots</li><li>Screen-Size is used to 'bound'/clamp enemy movement (1920x1080), so probably doesn't play well with other resolutions.</li><li>The game loads Level 2 Enemies into the First Loop (but only when the game is built into an .exe and not in development for some reason)</li><li>??????
