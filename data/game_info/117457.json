Requires two people to play!</p><p><strong>Custom Content</strong><br/>You can create your own maps of 40x30 tiles.  A 0 means space, and 1 means ground.  You can find a blank template in the same location you found the readme and the jar file.<br/>If custom maps aren't enough, the xcf (for GIMP) file for the few textures used in the game are inside the jar.  You can use that to modify the look of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d7/8d78d51381d42b4afc6d1ec8b53f1c12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Noah Greenberg"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
