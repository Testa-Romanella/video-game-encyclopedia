{"id": 1545, "slug": "hand-of-fate", "name": "Hand of Fate", "name_original": "Hand of Fate", "description": "<p>Hand of Fate is an unusual combination of various genres. It is based on mechanics typical for deck-building board games, but also features rogue-like and hack-and-slash elements. Its approach to the storytelling is typical for tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. <br />\nYou play cards against the Dealer, who is both your DM, opponent, and narrator of your adventures. Each card represents an item, a character, or an encounter. You navigate your character through the story that unfurls as you reveal the cards and make your choices. The goal is to collect a powerful deck of cards that give your character better weapons, armor, and other equipment. You can unlock more cards after you defeat bosses and complete quests. The Dealer\u2019s goal is to hamper your progress, as he plays his cards to put new obstacles in your way.<br />\nMost of the time the game will only show you the cards and the Dealer who sits across the table from you. You will learn the events from listening to him and reading the text on cards. Battles, however, are actually fought in real time by animated characters on visualized 3D arenas. This is very unusual for board game simulators and brings some variety into the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2015-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:25:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9cb8c4e69907a68e33a4ebb2580f82a.jpg", "website": "http://www.defiantdev.com/hof1.html", "rating": 3.7, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 113, "owned": 2062, "beaten": 148, "toplay": 37, "dropped": 146, "playing": 31}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 265, "ratings_count": 314, "suggestions_count": 534, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 316, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Defiant Development"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Defiant Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
