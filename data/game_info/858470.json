You are self employed cook and your roommate can eat whatever she wants, so be sure you will have all the options, because if not, she will skip meal. Also you will have to earn money and the amount of money depends on the cooking skill, so be sure to increase it as fast as you can to earn more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Warning! Read this before you buy!\r\n</p>\n<p>If you follow me, you should know, that for now I create multiple short games with some sort of game mechanics in almost standard interface. It is literally a bunch of images, that appear in different circumstances and there is almost no weight gain. All my games are stuffing games. And for me the main value is that they are different. Different models, morphs, clothes, different style of interactions. Every game is an experiment. They are as they are. Some people, such as me like such things and diversity. So if you are not into it, i ask you to understand and to forgive))\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T11:42:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a46/a463f002b53b56e07122efc013326a5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yuliya3k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
