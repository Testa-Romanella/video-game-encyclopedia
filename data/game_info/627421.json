This project was made over the span of 72 hours. All art, music and code are made within the Jam time and yours truly as per the Jam requirements.</p>\n<p>The theme for the Jam was 'Unconventional Means', so what better way to exercise an\u00a0<em>Unconvential Mean</em> than to mandate a Ricochet in your shot towards your enemies in order to be deemed\u00a0<em>cool enough\u00a0</em>for a kill.</p>\n<p>This is my 3rd Game Jam thus far, and I'm glad to see an improvement in all areas of my craft. Leave a comment, like, or whatever you want to leave on this page.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Onwards and Upwards!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T11:32:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33a/33a1796ed7d0347c0805e675023160b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Schtarr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
