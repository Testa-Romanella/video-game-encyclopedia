In this project, I had changed the platforms to look like mushrooms instead by changing the shape of the floor tiles. I did this for two of the platforms. I also changed the aesthetics of the goal pick up to a star. If you look at the screen shots it is in star format rather than a crystal format. For my last modification, I changed one of the walking enemies to look like a floating skull instead. This skull is smaller but also floats without needing to walk on its feet.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T17:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65f/65faf9b17c4d5f587934470f9a94e5f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["jzhan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
