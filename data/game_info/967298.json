Episode 1 Manhunt", "description": "[!] BE ADVISED - at this time the game doesn't run well on older GPUs. Try the free demo first and see if it works on your hardware. Performance improvements are planned for future updates.<br/><br/><h3> Experience the real, medieval Dracula </h3><br/>This game is about the real Dracula, the medieval voievode / warlord of Valahia (there are no vampires here). The game is built around key historical events: Dracula's first ascension to the throne of Valahia. Vlad Tepes is held as a political prisoner / hostage at the Ottoman Court when he learns the Hungarians invade Valahia, killed his family and offer the throne to their own servant. In response, sultan Murad sends Dracula with an Ottoman army to take his rightful throne and stop Valahia from joining another crusade. But not everyone wants Dracula to rule,  he has many enemies, even in the Ottoman capital of Edirne.  <br/><br/><h3>Different play styles </h3><br/>First of all this is a platformer, so mastering the character's mobility and momentum while crossing the terrain is a challenge in itself, and is part of the core experience. There are six playable characters, and every one of them handles differently. When you change the character, the experience is always fresh, and it comes with new strengths and weaknesses waiting to be mastered.<br/><br/><h3>Vlad Voievod Dracula</h3> <br/>Dracula comes in five variants, with five different swords and five different outfits. When you choose a sword, you commit to it the entire game. Each sword handles differently, and affects your mobility and combat tactics in different ways, keeping the experience fresh. (For beginners, it is recommended you start with the first or last sword).<br/><br/><h3>Dracula's Knights</h3><br/>In the first level, you get to know Dracula and you get used to a certain play style. In level three, you will start to experience playing with Dracula and his knights, and you will change characters during play. Again, each one handles differently, so the experience will always be fresh!<br/><br/><h3>The spies</h3><br/>In the second and the forth level, you will play with spies, and the gameplay changes radically. There is less focus on combat and more focus on movement. To clear an area with a spy, you need to gather all three peaces of information scattered around the level, and at the end, get the map.<h3>Share your thoughts</h3>For those who choose to support my work: thank you!
