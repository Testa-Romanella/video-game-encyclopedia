I don\u2019t know who you are or how you got here, but let me tell you this: You\u2019ll regret coming here. It\u2019s a fine place in the daylight \u2013 the sun hanging low over the ponds, a beautiful scene. When the clock strikes midnight, though, it\u2019s a different story. The souls of the damned lurk the shadows, I tell you. You\u2019ll see them soon enough. They\u2019ll find you and take you among their ranks, and I\u2019ll warn you this: They will get to you. I was hopeful of escape at first as well, but there\u2019s no way out. Only prolonging the wait to your inevitable demise. I can\u2019t help you. Nobody can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What I can give you are what shall be remembered as my last words \u2013 Stay in the light. The Souls knock the trees enough that you\u2019ll find the occasional piece of wood, and I advise you use it, keep a fire going, fashion a torch, anything you can do, you must. I made fires as well, they\u2019re scattered throughout here, but I\u2019ve tried to fashion paths to find my way back to them. Sometimes, one of the Damned will be freed, and they\u2019ll leave their last gifts upon the ground. Listen closely to the tune of their salvation, and you\u2019ll be able to hunt their treasures down.</p>\n<p>I hope you had a good life.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lieut.
