You can't escape alone, but you can escape together. Each monster has different abilities, and different weaknesses. Use them to help your comrades survive the onslaught of bear traps, a giant flying gun thing, and...bushes.</p><p>There's no endgame as of yet, but it's still pretty fun.</p><p>WASD/Arrow Keys or Mouse to move.</p><p>Click/Space Bar to jump.</p><p>I also left in a few dev cheats, because it's a game jam and I always wish they were there when I play other jam games. We're all developers here, there's no need to pretend.</p><p>K to take one damage. (useful for building up a swarm)</p><p>R to restart the game.</p><p>X to close the game on the standalone executable.</p><p>No audio, I couldn't get anything decent sounding together, so I decided to spare your ears. Mostly glitch free, but when I was going back and forth taking screenshots, I checked back and noticed that I was traveling insanely fast and also invisible, so props to you if you can reproduce that.</p><p>When you get bored, just leave it to idle, it's a great screensaver.</p><p>Made for Ludum Dare 33: You are the Monster</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76f8ca3a3919adb25e3446fcf82f831c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Mister Walter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
