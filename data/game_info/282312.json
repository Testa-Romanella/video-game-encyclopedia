The Spirit of Receiving sure does! Take control of presents and ensure they make it to their intended recipient, avoiding the watchful gaze of parents, up late at night making Christmas preparations.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in one week for the Awful Holiday Jam, with the theme of \"Festive Spirits.\" I handled the code and sound, while\u00a0the artwork was done by\u00a0megane.
