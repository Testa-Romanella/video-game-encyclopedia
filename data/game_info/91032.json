She often delivers food to her stubborn grandmother, who prefers to live alone in the woods. While the forest is a dangerous place full of wolves, the village and her grandmother's house were peaceful. </p>\n<p>However, once a travelling, charismatic hunter decided to settle near the village and offered to protect it, the local wolves became mysteriously violent and began to attack the village in erratic bursts of activity. Due to these events, some villagers praise the hunter for his help in keeping the wolves out of their homes. The others can't help but think there's something suspicious about the matter. Despite it all, Lenora still has a grandmother to take care of, and so she wakes up to begin her routine of visiting her grandmother anew. </p>\n<p><strong>Play This Game If You Like:</strong> </p>\n<ul><li>100% original graphics</li><li>Dialogue-heavy narration and storylines</li><li>Quick games that complete in 1hr or under</li><li>Female protagonists</li><li>Multiple endings</li><li>Unnecessary sprint and crawl toggle mechanics that are fun anyway so sure whatever</li><li>Pokemon Yellow-inspired color palettes</li><li>Western fairytale retellings that don't have too much grimdark</li><li>The color pink</li></ul>\n<strong>Please consider supporting Huntress on Patreon! :)</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d4/9d4d5db6a9a746cdde4c3542865f6ee3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bleet"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
