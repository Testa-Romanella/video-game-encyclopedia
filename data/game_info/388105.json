For this project, I used Unreal Engine's FPS starter template to create an escape room game. The theme for this game was inspired by UE4's starter content materials that give it a very sci-fi look.\u00a0I was exposed to many of the software's features such as blueprints, widgets, lighting, and materials. Due to time constraints, the game isn't very fleshed out or really close to being a finished product. I think in my free time I'd definitely like to go back to this and see what improvements I can make!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T06:34:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9f/b9fdd032831404ec3896325bb6c759ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RossWoods"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
