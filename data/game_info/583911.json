All three professions are varying manifestations of witchcraft and Magick (Invocation, Ritual, Charm) with various playstyles. By acquiring grimoires, Magicians may learn and invoke new spells...and summon forth different types of daemons into the mortal plane....\u00a0</p>\n<p>As one of these professions, it is your task to survive the impending\u00a0 daemonic\u00a0apocalypse... <em>by any means necessary.</em> This will involve exploring the town of Aschenbr\u00fccke, a town located upon the forgotten, forsaken\u00a0fringes of the Empire, shrouded in a mysterious fog. Uncover the towns mysteries, and accumulate greater Magick\u00a0power through the acquisition\u00a0of grimoires hidden throughout the towns darkened\u00a0corners...<br/></p>\n<p>Yet be warned! For uncovering forbidden texts and grimoires will inevitably draw suspicion amongst the population of the town. If a magician is observed reading from grimoires or casting spells, they will raise their notoriety, with potentially disastrous consequences. Casting Magick spells also incurs a risk of 'Taint,' a form of Magick corruption that manifests within...thus, Magick is powerful, yet not without risks.</p>\n<p>Upon each passing day, the day of reckoning draws ever closer... use you time wisely in\u00a0<strong><em>Maleficara. </em></strong>You must\u00a0ensure the necessary preparations for the end...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T01:25:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb8/fb8fb009deb47a3c9f9ca3cc63058b9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joepgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
