Cycle between members of your team and dodge, block, or catch to avoid your opponent's throws. The longer you charge your throws the more powerful they become.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This early release version of the game includes a\u00a0randomized set of players on each team in a single, replayable exhibition match. If there is enough\u00a0interest, future versions of the game will include team and player customization, ranked league play, and more.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my first game and I hope you enjoy playing.
