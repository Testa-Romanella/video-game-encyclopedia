Tons of interact-ibles with optional dialogue if you like! If it looks colorful or interact-able it probably is!</p>\n<p>A reflection on my life and dreams from the last 2 years.\u00a0A personal project that took 2 years and a lot of life getting in the way to complete. During that time,\u00a0I had almost no time for things like making games.\u00a0This project is a hybrid between pixel landscapes and scenes I made back in the spring of 2019, and dialogue I wrote in the fall of 2020. Please explore, listen, and if you enjoy ramblings and reflection, you might have a good time.</p>\n<p>A late entry into the Essay Bitsy Jam!</p>\n<p>Quick Shout-out to Onion who allowed me to add them in as a tiny reference - thanks for all your help / support with the main game coding back in 2019!</p>\n<p>This project was made using a vaguely remembered combination of Bitsy 5.3, several Borksy hacks (mostly for colors, exit from dialogue, and some other things I can't quite remember) and BitsyMuse for music functionality.</p>\n<p>I built all the sprites / art in Aseprite then transferred them over by hand.\u00a0There is probably an easier way, but I didn't know it at the time!</p>\n<p>Music from the ever excellent Kevin MacLeod. The track is a slightly edited version of Windswept from the album Calming, changed to loop more smoothly. Info about the track below!
