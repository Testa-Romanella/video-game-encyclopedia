The game mechanics are inspired by classic survival horror games. As you navigate the levels, you encounter intrusive thoughts, which increase your dysphoria meter. If the meter reaches 100%, it's game over, so you need to properly manage your phone battery in order to distract yourself from the thoughts and make it through the day.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game's soundtrack is a collection of songs from various Patricia Taxxon albums.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nContent warning: for: transphobia, death, and abuse<br/>\n<br/>\r\nControls<br/>\n<br/>\r\nW - Walk forward/enter room<br/>\n<br/>\r\nS - Walk backward<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA - Turn left<br/>\n<br/>\r\nD - Turn right<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnter - Accept/advance text<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpace - Open/close phone<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEsc - Enter/exit fullscreen", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T01:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34fe488160ac27f687bc25df0b640851.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fewprime"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fewprime"], "esrb_rating": null}
