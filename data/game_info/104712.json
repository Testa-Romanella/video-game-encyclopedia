The place is Washington D.C. Our silent protagonist carjacks an abandoned tank in hopes of an escape towards the Great North, near the lands of the Free and the places of Maples &amp; Moose's. You're not alone in this short adventure though, someone is talking to you through the radio. Except it's not someone... it's <em>THE TANK</em>!</p><p>Well, that was the concept anyway, didn't have time to finish it! Made for the 1-bit Clicker jam obviously, but internet died right before the deadline. RIP.</p><p>Sorry for the lack of clear instructions and/or goals in-game! It's REALLY hard to 'lose' though, and the only way to 'win' it is to press forward.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c6102f70ec12e53601edac052737c2ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vicarious"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
