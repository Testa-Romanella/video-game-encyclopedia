Each color gun also corresponds to a different firing mode. Destroying enemies will charge up your omni cannon, which can harm any color.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Mouse</strong>\u00a0\u2014 Aim</p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong>\u00a0\u2014 Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>Right Mouse Button</strong>\u00a0\u2014 Bring up the color selection wheel, release on the desired color</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Don't let the colored polyhedra get to the rail at the bottom of the screen by shooting them with color guns and draining their RGB components. <br/>\r\nEach gun removes a red, green or blue component or different combinations of those. Each gun also has a unique firing mode, based on its color components (red fires slow but powerful explosive bombs, green fires many small fast bullets, blue fires rays that can hit multiple enemies).<br/>\r\nEach polyhedron that gets to the rail will drain your cannon's energy, but each polyhedron you destroy will replenish some. Energy above 100% will be converted to white energy that can be used to fire your omni cannon: a fast, powerful, auto-aiming gun to be used when the fight gets tough.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Developed by Fabio Scita<br/>\r\nMusic by\u00a0Kevin MacLeod</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T05:27:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cea/cea4fd92606c82887822fb14e765f508.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fabio Scita"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
