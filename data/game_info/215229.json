You must solve all of them to prevent WW3.<br/></p>\n<p>Take irrevocable decisions which will affect the future! You may be cause of the WW3! But only one who can prevent WW3 is you, too! You have to make peace between the countries.</p>\n<p>Peace of the world in your hands! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls for 2D;</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Hold down the mouse-left button to zoom in and move on the map</li><li>Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out and move on the map</li><li>Press mouse-right button to reset zoom and position</li><li>Click with mouse-left button to the crises(lines) on the map to see the details of the crises</li></ul><p><strong>Controls for 3D;</strong></p><ul><li>Hold down the mouse-left button and drag to rotate the earth</li><li>Hold-down the mouse-right button to zoom in the earth</li><li>Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out the earth</li><li>Press the mouse wheel to reset zoom</li><li>Click with mouse-left button to the crises(lines) on the earth to see the details of the crises</li></ul>\n<p>The game is still <strong>not finished</strong> but it's playable! I will add a few things which will make my game better. E.g. <strong>procedural crisis system</strong> is one of them. I have started to make this sytem. The game will be <strong>more logical </strong>and so crises and results of them will be better. Result text will be <strong>more related</strong> to your decisions than the peace rate between the countries. Of course, there will be <strong>more crises and their variations. </strong>So game will be <strong>more playable and logical </strong>than now.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S: I'm sorry but you will probably see some English grammar mistakes in the game. Because I'm just 15 and my native isn't English</strong> :)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>P.S 2: Old version had some known bugs and they fixed in updated version.</strong></p>\n<p>My game(and 4 other game which are entries for WGJ59) has been played by<strong> akai-0okami</strong>. You can watch the video on YouTube.</p>\n<ul><li><strong><em>!
