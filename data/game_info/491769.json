It is possible to play with the keyboard but it is not recommended. To rotate the camera from left to right with the keyboard use the ( Q and E keys ), from down to up use the ( F and R keys )... To zoom and unzoom the camera use the ( C and V keys ) and finally to reset the camera use the ( K key )...<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game as been made entirely with the Smile Game Builder engine and as not been exported to Unity to customize it in any way! So this game is an example of what you can do with the SGB engine without any knowledge of programmation whatsoever!
