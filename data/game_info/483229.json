I ended up really only having a day to work on it in the end with odd bits of asset generation/world layout scattered across the rest of the week. The idea was that the family would move after you if they saw or heard you. Your exhaustion would increase as you performed actions. If a family memeber caught you you would lose. There was going to be a further development to the story post-jam. The original ending would see you find the key to the front door and escape. Unfortunately the whole world map broke and it took me til the end of the jam to repair it so I didn't have time to implement the last few bits to make it into an actual game. I will try to finish it up to the end-of-jam standard I was hoping and post it elsewhere after the jam.</p><p>Sound and art are a mixture of own work and CC0 assets. Most assets were tweaked in some way. Music is 100% not my creation.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:30:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/158/158c28648ddbb441c00a3ae9e29b699d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["drentsoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
