Utilizing time machines that take you back to the start time of the level, you\u2019ll need to plan your actions so that your future self can work with your past selves to overcome a variety of challenges. The base mechanics are simple, but their implications are immense.<br/><br/>Reasons to purchase<br/><ul><li>You enjoy mind-bending puzzle games<br/></li><li>You want to become certified in the operation of a time machine<br/></li><li>Temporal-linear causality is for suckers<br/></li><li>Future-you may own this game; by not purchasing it, you may cause a space-time paradox and destroy the universe. Are you really willing to take that risk?</li></ul><br/>Reasons not to purchase<br/><ul><li>You dislike puzzle games and/or fourth dimensional thinking<br/></li><li>You\u2019re a time traveler from the future, stranded in the present by a broken flux capacitor, and the mere thought of time travel makes you rue your cursed plight<br/></li><li>You hate the universe, and secretly hope your ignorance of time travel will eventually result in a space-time paradox, destroying everything</li></ul><br/>The game is for Windows, but should work for Mac and Linux as well. If you want to play it on Mac/Linux: you need the Java SE Runtime Environment 8 or higher installed, and can launch it by executing ttt.jar. So it's less user friendly to launch, and needs more testing; I'd like to address these during early release, time permitting, and update the status to being fully Mac/Linux compatible.<br/><br/>Early access: I want your feedback! Check out the early access section, and what me know what you think.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T04:47:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23b/23bb06130edc29243c8efa878b9a1a40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Time Travel Trainer"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Time Travel Trainer"], "esrb_rating": null}
