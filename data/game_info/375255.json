Your task is to defend the captured German bunker. To survive you must always be ready: fed, rested and full of energy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWell, it won't always be that easy. Remember to check the supply regularly. If there are not enough bandages, food or ammunition, send a message to the command with a request for delivery. It is mandatory to enter the password in the walrus code. You can always search the bodies of those killed in battle - sometimes you will even find chocolate!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou must also take care of your companions. Order wisely and share food.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPerform missions - be vigilant - the enemy can come at any time. Fortunately, you have a machine gun, anti-aircraft gun, and an anti-tank cannon. Receive encrypted messages and anticipate your enemy's plans. And it's good to put your faces in the right places, always 'one less'.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-16T13:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/137/137eaa4c51607a348d67cd744259c5f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 373, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BEPLAYER"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ultimate Games", "Art Games Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
