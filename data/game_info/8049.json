Also a new Yellow Critter is added. A new Leaderboard will be used!<br/><br/>========================================<br/><br/>Caveman is hitting the Pong at the cliff face by himself. <br/><br/>1) Time his jump to block the Pong. <br/>2) Tap to make him jump. He scores every time he blocks the pong. Don&amp;#39;t let the Pong get pass him!<br/>3) If the Pong bounce low, he doesn&amp;#39;t need to jump.<br/><br/>But watch out for the Critters! They will come out of the their hole and mess Caveman&amp;#39;s game! Different colour Critters will different things to the Pong.<br/><br/>This is super addictive!<br/><br/>Twitter: @tokamatic", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fc251fb24c6380c67ee6b6d94a8a576.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Tokamak Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Tokamak Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
