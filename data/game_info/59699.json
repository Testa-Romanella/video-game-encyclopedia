Brandish records, cameras, musical instruments and more against enemies ranging from floating, yammering skulls to tortoise samurais.<br />\nYIIK has more than 30 hours of content including a fully-voiced main story campaign featuring talents such as Chris Niosi (Tales of Zestiria, Disgaea 5), Clifford Chapin (Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Attack on Titan, RWBY) and more.<br />\nPolygonal rendering, lack of textures and a rich, saturated color scheme lend to the dreamlike, otherworldly qualities of the environments and their inhabitants. The soundtrack \u2013 including contributions from composers such as Toby Fox (Undertale) and Hiroki Kikuta (Secret of Mana) \u2013 is as eclectic as the gameplay, featuring an electroacoustic fusion of jazz, funk, traditional JRPG-style tunes and swing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-21T13:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/ddd43214a80cfce86bcf074f68d4f157.jpg", "website": "http://www.yiikrpg.com", "rating": 1.62, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 42, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 79, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ysbryd Games Worldwide", "Ackk Studios", "AckkStudios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ysbryd Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
