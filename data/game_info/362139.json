The controls are WASD or the arrow keys to move and space or the left mouse button to shoot.\u00a0Simply walk over the arrow to pick it up again. There are 6 waves with increasing number and difficulty of enemies with new types being introduced later. Be sure to leave any feedback you have in the comments. This is my first game jam so go easy on me :) Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:47:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4df10a994f6e7c9ccd31fa5756ffa458.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Agent_D1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
