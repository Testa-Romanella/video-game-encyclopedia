The game contains various types of waves including a boss wave. In addition, the game contains power-ups, different types of weapons with different upgrades and different types of enemies.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>For the Easter egg of this game,<br/>By completing the Easter egg of this game you unlock the ability to upgrade your weapons. Almost every weapon in the game has 4 upgrades, every upgrade gives the gun a new skin and makes it stronger.</p>\n\n<p>Journey,<br/>I started making this game on the 12th of April 2018. Although I already thought of the game's game concept much earlier. The idea for the game arose from a love for call of duty zombies. When I started with the first variant I was not satisfied with the quality, so I put the project down. Half a year later when I was drawing some sprites, I started to get so much inspiration that I restarted the software and went on with the concept but then with a whole new style. That's how Zlimes was born. A game where I put a lot of time and effort into but all this effort was well worth it.</p>\n<p>Movement,<br/>Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move around.<br/>Use the Mouse to aim.<br/>Click the Left Mouse Button to shoot or stab.<br/>Use the E or Q key to interact.</p>\n<p>Audio,<br/>The music in this game is licensed under Creative Commons.
