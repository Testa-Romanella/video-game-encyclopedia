Our grasp of control has loosened, and with each passing day the inevitability of chaos grows more and more.\u00a0 We as a species have come to an impasse, do we accept our fate and give up control? Or do we stand our ground and take back what is ours?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play as \"Barry\". A cute little robot, who also just so happens to be humanities last hope. Built with one purpose and one purpose only, take back control and find his lost professor.</p>\n<p>Use abilities such as \"Walk Forward\", and \"Jump!\" To outsmart the torturous puzzle's created by the evil [Redacted]. Humanities last hope (and the happiness of Barry's owner) hinge on your decisions, and Barry's tiny little metal pincers.</p>\n<p>A game created by humans, and definitely for humans, it will leave you asking yourself are we really ready for this type of Control. Join us in playing \"SAVE MY ROBOT\"</p>\n<p>IGM - 10/10 the game is a masterpiece, and a powerful narrative on the destructive cycle of revenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:38:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f26/f26bee99064fae386bbab8b273ff031e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Deleptual"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
