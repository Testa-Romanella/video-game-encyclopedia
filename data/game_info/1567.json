It was created as a tribute to classic spacesims of old such as Elite, Wing Commander Privateer, Escape Velocity and Freelancer. If you are a fan of these games, then you&#39;re in for a nostalgic ride!<br />\n[Key Features]<br />\n<em> Simple one-touch intuitive UI, no digital joysticks, just smooth easy flight &amp; fight with one-touch!<br />\n</em> Be a Cargo runner.<br />\n<em> Be a Mercenary unleashing firepower for wealth!<br />\n</em> Be a Miner seeking rare ores.<br />\n<em> Be a Merchant trading in goods!<br />\n</em> Be a Smuggler dealing in lucrative drugs &amp; evade the law!<br />\n<em> Be a Pirate attacking merchant ships, become infamous &amp; fight for anarchy!<br />\n</em> Join huge multi-faction Fleet Battles!<br />\n<em> Dynamic faction standing system, where your actions will determine friends or foes.<br />\n</em> Multiple ship classes to fly, including drone carriers &amp; the mighty Yamato Battleship!<br />\n* All ships are up-gradable with modules.<br />\nIn Star Nomad, you roam free in the Wildlands Sector while immersed in a sci-fi noir setting rich in humor. While a sandbox, it&#39;s also story driven with a personal plot inspired by classic cyberpunk such as Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic &amp; Gundam that puts you right in the pilot seat to determine the outcome of an escalating corporate war!<br />\n[Death!]<br />\nThere is no perma-death, but there is a death penalty, so take care! When your ship blows up, the life-pod will be rescued &amp; towed to a safe location. Insurance will give you a starter ship, and payout to cover most modules, however, the excess can be expensive.<br />\n[Factions]<br />\nBelow the Star Map, there&#39;s a dynamic faction standing indicator (green = ally, crosshair = enemy). Your actions will change the way the four major factions treat you.<br />\nHappy to receive feedback via email (halfgeekstudios@gmail.com) or twitter @AH_Phan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T16:06:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/229/229c6bec6786f69fa84ffbda1bd8ebad.jpeg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6UPWb-Xe6Y", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Anh Huy Phan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Anh Huy Phan"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
