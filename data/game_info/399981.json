You can read about those adventures here.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong> \u2b50\ufe0f PAY $20 OR MORE AND RECEIVE A UNIQUE CUSTOM BUILD \u2b50\ufe0f<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Pay $20 (US) or more and I'll send you a custom build of the game using the amount you paid as the seed used to generate the world. For example if you pay $33.15 the world will be generated from seed 3315 (each unique seed yields a different world to explore). You can also give me a custom message to include on the title screen (useful if you're giving the build as a gift). To receive a custom build first pay $20 or more for the game and then fill out this form. I'll then create the build and email you a download link (please allow a day or two for me to process your build).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cf/6cf9242ab71577b004e15b532cc34ce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ian MacLarty"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
