Can you collect all the coins without breaking the rope?</p>\n<p>This is a game made for Extra Credits Game Jam #4.</p>\n<p>Challenges added: Extra MonoChromatic.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<ul><li>Move: W, A, S, D</li><li>Jump: Space</li></ul>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<ul><li>There is no reset button, so you have to restart the game to play again.</li><li>There is only 1 level, and no UI. You just boot it up and play. You'll know when you finish the level :).</li><li>If your rope breaks and flies all over the place, either die or restart the game. Here, this is normal. (Or because I was new to Unity and didn't have enough time to fix it)</li></ul>\n<p>This is also my first ever game made with Unity (I could've used Stencyl because I'm more used to it, but nah), and my first game on itch.io.</p>\n<p>All feedbacks are appreciated, and thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T18:52:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22bbc29e9222ef07d111113e806f8a25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CD87"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
