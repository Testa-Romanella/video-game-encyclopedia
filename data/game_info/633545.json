Your mind resides in \uff48\uff45\uff41\uff56\uff45\uff4e, a digital paradise created for humans who can\u2019t live in Meatspace any longer. As you recall, you were a good human who earned your reward here. At first it was wonderful and truly perfect, at least to the best of your recollection, but now something is wrong. It feels emptier than before. No new Users are arriving. The \uff41\uff4e\uff47\uff45\uff4c\uff53 who take care of the place are behaving strangely. Memories are rotting. You can\u2019t perceive time. All the clocks are blinking 12:00, even the analog ones. The perfect destination has degraded into a liminal space. You must discover why.<br/><br/>You can run \uff48\uff45\uff41\uff56\uff45\uff4e\uff0e\uff45\uff58\uff45 alone or with any number of fellow wanderers at the same time. <strong>Do not print the book\u00a0out.</strong> It contains blacked-out secret text that you must click on in order to read. Each of you will need a device for reading this document, a printout of the character sheet, a twenty-sided die, and a six-sided die. It may also please you to have a web page open with an HTML color picker that lets you see colors by entering their hex codes.<br/><br/>Featuring two original tracks by\u00a0Jakov Cvetkovi\u0107</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T03:21:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/359/359359eaf24a27e552e4b656cf93913f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["billvolkgames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
