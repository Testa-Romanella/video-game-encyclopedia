Help them put the pieces\u00a0together to determine where their most treasured sleeping companion\u00a0has disappeared\u00a0to. Explore the wonders of magic and color, and what truly lurks deep below our beds.<br/></p>\n<p>As an army of one with little background in game development (2 years self taught) I sourced almost all project assets through the marketplace. All assets have some form of\u00a0modifications to them, modeling via blender, creation of materials/material f(x), or through some form of\u00a0programming/rigging and animation. This is the ultimate testament to kitbashing ;)</p>\n<p>While I think the theme is straight forward in terms of the game's interpretation - I'll point out the need for the player to cooperate between Above and Below worlds (and its multiple characters) to solve puzzles and move the storyline forward. A simple take on a classic battle between 2 worlds and what is sometimes really scary for children growing up - what lies under the bed?</p>\n<p>This project would technically qualify for the following categories \"Army of One\", \"Audio Experience\", \"Make us go WoW\", \"The KitBasher\".</p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>\n<p>Cam aka Fractured Fantasy\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T05:51:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba9/ba9554ab942b11d6b2bf0f41fcf60321.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fractured_Fantasy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
