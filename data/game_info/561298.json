We worked around this theme by having wrecking power of multiple sheep be stronger than the single sheep. The more sheep you have, the longer you survive, and the more chances you get to break your highest score in this infinite runner. We hope you enjoy!<br/><br/>Ash (Me!), Dodo (https://www.instagram.com/dalistrations/?hl=en), Kerro(https://itch.io/profile/quantumgraphie) ,\u00a0 Afif (https://itch.io/profile/rishene),  Kratos(https://itch.io/profile/rebelmodex)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbc/fbcf9163c2c83c0c0d5fc01bd2279e15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["ashlit1998"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
