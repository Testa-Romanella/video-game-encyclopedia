In your adventures, you'll explore dark caves, search forgotten temples for rare artifacts, and defeat treacherous enemies.  Realistic melee combat allows you to fully immerse yourself in glorious battle.  Complete missions to earn experience and gold that unlock powerful weapons and abilities to help you defeat your enemies.  Multiple classes and skill trees allow you to customize your character and become the most capable Sellsword in the kingdom.  Don't just watch the adventure - LIVE IT.StoryFor several generations, the King's Guard has kept vigilant watch over the kingdom, resulting in the longest period of peace ever known.

Most think his stories are fables; yet another clever ruse to keep mead and coin flowing in the old place.<br/><br/>One morning, there was an unusual bustle of activity in the town square.
