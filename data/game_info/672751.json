I'm pretty new to game dev but I think I went beyond my expectations for this jam.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You must keep the core stable while the cooling system is being repaired!</p>\n<p>On the left you have the buttons pannel. When the pad flashes, click in the colors seen at the top (Like simon says).</p>\n<p>In the middle you have two things. One is the code (on the top). Once you get a code you must type it back into the console.</p>\n<p>You also have sliders. These will decrease over time. Make sure to drag them back up occasionally.</p>\n<p>And finaly on the right you have the temperature. Hold down with your mouse on the handle to cool down the core.</p>\n<p>Make sure you do not let the cores stability drop to zero.\u00a0You can check it with the bar on the right wall.</p>\n<p>Enjoy playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T05:08:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a37/a370282285bd843ca007345206f64499.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Acebook"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
