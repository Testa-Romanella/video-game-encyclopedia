Your ship will come into view once he disappears. Four large mines will suddenly become activated.<br/>\r\n\tManeuver your ship within the galaxy in an effort to destroy the mines.<br/>\r\n\tAs you travel through space, fire at the mines. As you destroy them, additional mines will become activated. Be careful . . . the minelayer may reappear to seed the field, but you can blast him as well.<br/>\r\n\tOnce you make that part of the galaxy safe, you immediately travel to the next mine field. There are 30 different mine fields, each one becoming increasingly difficult.\t\r\n\t\r\n<p><strong>Getting Hit</strong></p>\n<p>If you are hit by a mine you will lose one ship. \r\nThe mission continues depending on your <em>Pilot Skill</em>:<br/>\n</p><p><em>Rookie</em></p>\r\nA new ship will mysteriously placed back into the field you are currently in and you can continue to clear out that field if you have any ships remaining.<br/>\n<em>Beware</em>: A collision with the minelayer will result in the reseeding of that field.\r\n<p><em>Veteran</em></p>\r\nOriginal mode. The minelayer will reseed the field you are currently in and you will have another chance to clear out that field if you have any ships remaining.\n<p><strong>Types of Mines</strong></p>\n<strong>Floating Mines</strong>\n<br/>\r\n\tThese are \"dumb\" mines which simply drift through space.<br/>\n<strong>Fireball Mines</strong>\n<br/>\r\n\tThese mines hurl a fireball at you as soon as you hit <br/>them.\r\n\tYou can avoid the fireball or destroy it with a rocket.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t \r\n\t \r\n\t <strong>Magnetic Mines</strong>\n<br/>\r\n\t These mines will follow you anywhere in the galaxy you go.<br/>\n<strong>Magnetic-Fireball Mines</strong>\n<br/>\r\n\tThese mines have the traits of both Magnetic and Fireball Mines.<br/>\n<p><strong>Field Types</strong></p>\r\nEach of the 30 mine fields gets more difficult, but each starts with 4 large mines. Once a large mine is destroyed, 2 medium-sized mines are activated.<br/>\r\n\tWhen a medium-sized mine is destroyed, 2 small mines are activated. The first field has 4 floating mines. Each new field starts with harder combinations of mines.<br/>\r\n\tWill you discover the types of mines in Field 30?\r\n<p><strong>Number of Ships</strong></p>\n\r\nIn each game you start with 5 ships. A bonus ship is awarded if you clear out 3 fields.\r\n Scoring\r\nPoints are awarded for destroying the mines, as follows:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t<strong>Type of Mine</strong>\n<strong>Large\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>Medium\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>Small\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tFloating\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t100\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t135\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t200\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tFireball\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t325\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t360\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t425\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMagnetic\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t500\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t535\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t600\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tMagnetic-Fireball\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t750\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t785\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t850\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAdditionally, <strong>110</strong> points are earned for hitting the fireball itself and <strong>1000</strong> points for hitting the minelayer.\r\n Final Words\r\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nThank you for volunteering!<br/>\r\n\tGood luck with your mission, you will need it. It's not an easy task!<br/>\r\n\tMine field 1 is cleared by many new recruits with \"ease\".<br/>\r\n\tMine field 2 is very tough, until you learn to keep your distance and always fire straight lines at fireball mines.<br/>\r\n\tMine field 3 seems to be a \"piece of cake\" compared to the previous if you have mastered the art of thrust.<br/>\r\n\tMine field 4 . . . the end for many aspiring pilots. Once passed, you have mastered to eliminate all mine types.<br/>\r\n\tNow it's up to you!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n Developer Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nrecreated the classic \r\n\t<strong>Vectrex</strong> arcade shooter game <strong>MineStorm</strong> for the <strong>Pico-8</strong> platform for your enjoyment.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThere were made some changes and additions in the design of the game to make it more playable on the <strong>Pico-8</strong> platform.\r\n<p><strong>Changes and additions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The scale of all game objects have been adjusted to suit the smaller screen size better.<br/>\n</li>\n<li>The movement physics have been adjusted to suit the smaller screen size better.</li>\n<li>Single player only</li>\n<li>Two levels of difficulty</li>\n<li>Autofire (default) is a feature in the options menu.</li>\n<li>A bonus ship is awarded every 3 fields instead of every 4.</li>\n<li>30 mine fields, instead of 13.</li>\n<li>Space dust is not included.</li>\n<li>The ships mysterious Escape feature is much safer to use than in the original.</li>\n<li>The overlay HUD shows the current mine field number in the bottom left corner.</li>\n<li>The overlay HUD is dynamic and parts are being turned on and off during game play.</li>\n<li>A victory screen is awarded after clearing all 30 mine fields.</li>\n<li>Persistent High Score and Control settings.</li>\n</ul>\r\n Pico-8 Cartridge\r\n<p>\r\nCartridge available at the \r\n<strong>Lexaloffle BBS</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\n Trivia\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\tThe design of this page is based on the original box design of Vectrex cartridges:<br/><br/>\r\n\t\r\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\t</li>\n<li>The game instructions are taken from the original <strong>MineStorm manual</strong> and edited where changes applied.</li>\n<li>Screenshots may differ slightly from the release version.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T09:17:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/543/543529edc1caf3ee3d4d056333a740dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["A-TOM"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
