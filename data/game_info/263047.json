Players switch their avatar between each side of the screen to avoid and/or destroy procedurally generated obstacles. Interacting with anything that is on the same side of the screen as the player's avatar will force the player to move to the other side, creating fast-paced puzzle solving.</p>\n<p>The core of the game is the many challenges that the player will have to accomplish. Each of them twisting the rules of the game to keep the experience fresh and interesting. Completing challenges unlocks new vibrant colour palettes which players can explore in the competitive Endless mode or Relaxation mode of the game.</p>\n<p>SOMOS is designed for PC and mobile, and suitable for advanced and casual gamers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/392/392471c5d4eb355c545afed0bd9071fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sprawl"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
