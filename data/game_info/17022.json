But they flew again - to avenge the defeat. This time they prepared a full-scale landing on the surface of the planet. We have nothing left but to play the invisible commander of all the forces of mankind, to throw out the enemies and destroy them not only on our land, but also on their own planet Titan.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, the game is built around the same principle - the defense of the &quot;tower&quot;, the command center. The goal of each level is to protect the command center from destruction. The Titans are trying to destroy the tower. And they do it for several dozen missions, the action of which unfolds on many planets.<br />\nFor defense, you can take a variety of actions. You can fight with various weapons, you can build buildings for various purposes, use the technologies that are to be opened. For all this, resources are needed, they must be extracted and their consumption calculated. Enemies are diverse, in addition to ordinary &quot;aliens&quot; there are super-powerful bosses - to win they have to invent special strategies.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2010-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-24T12:05:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca3/ca31ca841afd79e9af9eeea0592b0e2f.jpg", "website": "http://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans", "rating": 2.98, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 70, "owned": 1505, "beaten": 23, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 38, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 77, "ratings_count": 93, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 93, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Puppygames"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Puppy Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
