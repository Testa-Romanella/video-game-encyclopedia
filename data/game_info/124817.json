Too many leaves on the ground and you lose!</p>\n<p>There's a timer after each wave of leaves; during this time no leaves will fall.</p>\n<p>Careful! The more lasers you use, the less time you have between waves. You can recoup the time loss incurred by the laser by frying lots of leaves at once!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Source code: https://github.com/markopolojorgensen/ludum_dare_40<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/6772d469a0f7eca3d6804925ec4c9088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["markopolodev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
