(theme: Sticky Justice)</p>\n<p>Achievements Attempted:<br/><strong>Mozart</strong>\u00a0- compose your own music.<br/><strong>One Punch Man</strong>\u00a0- Your game is controllable with a single input<br/><strong>Maverick</strong>\u00a0- Your team size is 1.<br/><strong>Gameboy</strong>\u00a0- Your game only uses 8-bit soundfx and is in\u00a0the classic gameboy 4-color green palette. (I also stuck to the gameboy's 160x144 resolution)</p>\n<p>I also tried to work with the spirit of the Ergonomically Horrifying achievement (The controls for your game put the human body in some strange positions) as much as I could with a single button input. I went for\u00a0more of a strange mind position than a body position with this one.</p>\n<p>Screen shake can be toggled on and off\u00a0with the S key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a16/a1635986a3ad4835c1c5b5de6181620a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FrancisVace"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
