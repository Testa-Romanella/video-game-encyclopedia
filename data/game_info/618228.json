When only one of your cards is still enabled, all of your cards are reenabled.</p>\n<p>When you deal damages, you deal the amount of damage shown on the card plus your attack value minus the enemy's defense value.</p>\n<p>However, certain cards calculate damage in different ways: \"ignore target's defense, user defense influence: 200%\" means that this card will deal the amount of damage shown on the card plus twice the defense value of its user.</p>\n<p>Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any other questions or problems!</p>Credits :<p><strong>Design, Code, Art &amp; Music:</strong> Fledered (me)</p><p>(I reused a battle theme I made before the Jam, but I made the main music during it)</p><p><strong>Fonts :</strong></p><p>\"Bebas Regular\" by <em>Dharma Type</em></p><p>\"Unzialish\"  by <em>Manfred Klein</em><br/></p><p><strong>Sounds Effects :</strong></p><p>\"Casual Game Sound - One Shot SFX Pack\" by <em>Dustyroom</em></p><p>Available on Freesound.com :<br/></p><p><em>(Bite) 467701__lucasduff__monster-bite</em></p><p><em>(Electric) 559757__rizzard__electrical-hit</em></p><p><em>(Fire) 563541__colorscrimsontears__fire-rpg</em></p><p><em>(Poison) 445961__breviceps__cartoon-video-game-bubble-shot</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:51:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bc/0bc27d0343b72c69533b56accbf7ca50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Fledered"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
