Combine that with \"The less ammo, the better!\" and you have Lead Eaters.</p>\r\nImplementation\r\n<p>I pretty much only stopped to eat, exercise and sleep (again). Implementation was very much easier than any other Jam I've made. This time around, I focused on a Dialogue System and explored Couroutines to do cutscenes.\u00a0 I'm really happy with the results!</p>\r\nFuture Ideas\r\n<p>Here are some ideas I had if I ever came back to this project:</p>\n<p>1 - Add the art missing art.</p>\n<p>2 - Add the missing\u00a0the sound effects.</p>\n<p>3 - Think of original guns.\u00a0</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>This section is dedicated to feedback.</p>\r\nCredits &amp; Links\r\n<p>Programmer: Me\u00a0https://dans1997.itch.io/\u00a0&amp; caioreigot (https://caiocosta.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Game Design:\u00a0 Me &amp; caioreigot</p>\n<p>Art: RipTheJacker (https://www.instagram.com/jagged.liness/)</p>\n<p>Sound Effects &amp; Main Theme: munchkin918</p>\n<p>Github of the project:\u00a0https://github.com/Dans1997/Lead-Eaters</p>\n<p>Link of the jam:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/blackthornprod-game-jam-3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d9e1ffc8ffa3cd115b00a0cd7944848.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danillo Neves"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
