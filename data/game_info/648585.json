Or like, just be a mess ? This game is for you.</p>\n<p>Go on a lukewarm quest against the system, solve puzzles, meet weirdos.<br/></p>\n<p>Gamepad and input remapping are supported with the in-game menu. It should take less than an hour to complete but you can save your progress at any time. The game is fully localized in both English and French.</p>\n<p>I released this game in 2013, after working on it for 3 years on and off.
