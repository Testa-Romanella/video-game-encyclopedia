You\u2019ve weathered the centuries on your perch in constant vigil and when invaders appear in the northern sky, you are the only line of defense.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Last Turret is a casual shooter game that you can play just with one hand! You play as an ancient, but powerful, turret whose only job is to protect the Etherians from the invaders. Upgrade your weapons and defend the cities, over-watch convoys as the Etherians flee falling cities and finally attack the mothership and drive the invaders back into the sky.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T23:46:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/581/5811b95490f165be306744473af05855.jpg", "website": "https://wrong.dog/the-last-turret/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["wrong.dog studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["wrong.dog studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
