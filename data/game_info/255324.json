{"id": 255324, "slug": "another-day-another-game-prototype-collection", "name": "Another Day, Another Game Prototype Collection", "name_original": "Another Day, Another Game Prototype Collection", "description": "<p>A collection of prototypes from the days when I published games under the moniker Another Day, Another Game. These prototypes were mostly made in GameMaker in the year 2012, though some may have been from 2011. Some additional prototypes and the source code for most of the prototypes listed here were lost when the laptop I owned around that time died.</p>\n<p>This list is organized by release date, with the top entry being the most recently released prototype.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Included Games:<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mystical Rug</strong> - A Magic Carpet Demake done in the style of the original Gameboy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lemmpong</strong> - A mix of Lemmings and Pong. Two-player only.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Caveman</strong> - A not-game with a real-time day/night and seasonal system. You need to re-light your fire. Made for MiniLD #37.</p>\n\n<p><strong>These Tranquil Waters Shall Not Hold</strong> - A relaxing adventure through the deep sea in a blue submarine. Made for GMCJam #6.<br/></p>\n<p><em>I've been told that this one is extremely disorienting.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Interstellar Planet-Ship Adventures: The Search for...$@#% Aliens!!!!!!</strong> - An experimental strategy/arcade hybrid made for Ludum Dare 23. Be sure to read the how-to before playing. </p>\n<p><em>This one is not put together very well. At the time, I had been trying to learn how to use GameMaker's pathfinding system while making a game in a weekend. It didn't turn out too well and that lends to a very poor gameplay experience.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Additionally, at present, I've only been able to recover the Mac version.<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>Burn, Witch, Burn!</strong> - Save yourself from being burned alive by angry peasants by typing spells out! Made for 0h Game Jam.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Crying Woods</strong> - A short game, originally made for the TIGSource Fall Festival competition, that was never finished. You're chasing a squonk.</p>\n<p><em>This was the first game that I ever made. You can find more information about it here.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/030/03045c17395956700d0e836fb33db751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Matt Chelen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
