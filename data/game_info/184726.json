It uses data in a format that is found on the internet, perhaps requiring a bit of editting.</p>\n<p>The beauty of this implementation is that it is fully OpenGL 3.3 core profile, and uses no OpenGL-deprecated functions.</p>\n<p>It has few embellishments, but it does have undo (u), restart (r), and setpoint (z) functions. Each data file has several \"levels\". The next (n) and previous (p) keys move between levels. Bigger (b) and smaller (s) keys help you adjust the size of the window. The (left-shift) and (right-shift) keys move you to the previous or next puzzle files. To move the \"pusher\" use the arrow keys. The objective is to push all the movable objects onto their targets.</p>\n<p>And now there is an embedded AutoSolver to help you!\u00a0 Just press the \"=\" key.<br/></p>\n<p>Includes precompiled solvers for each platform;  and the complete game state is saved on exit so that your progress through the levels of each puzzle file are preserved.<br/></p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------<br/>## Features</p>\n<p>* runs on Windows, OSX, Linux;<br/></p>\n<p>* uses SDL2;<br/>* works on Retina displays;<br/>* uses SFML for applause sound;</p>\n<p>* autosolver built-in<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/181/181525c8ad518e5611b0e2275b2da261.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["fastrgv"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
