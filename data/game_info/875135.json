The goal is simple - reach the finish line before your opponents by using pickups such as torpedoes and rotten fish and staying clear of the exploding barrels and cannons that try to blast you into oblivion. Additionally you need to master the waves of the ocean, both above and beyond the surface.</p>\r\nThe game features:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Local multiplayer</strong> - Play with your friends</li><li><strong>Character selection</strong>\u00a0<strong>menu </strong>- Make it personal</li><li><strong>Multiple levels</strong>\u00a0- From pirate coves to viking fjords</li><li><strong>Dual power ups\u00a0</strong>- Use what is suited for the occasion</li><li><strong>All expected features are included</strong> - everything from race positioning to minimap</li></ul>\r\nTeam\r\nDesigners:\r\n<ul><li>Sushant Bhonde</li><li>Domhnall Henderson</li><li>Emil Leijon</li></ul>\r\nProgrammers:\r\n<ul><li>Alice Tarkanm\u00e4ki Bohman<br/>\n</li><li>Kai Wang</li><li>Henrik\u00a0Sedvall</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T10:32:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09aa121ab3832146a41b8610882ade02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
