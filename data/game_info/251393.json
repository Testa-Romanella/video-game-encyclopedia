While working on an archaeological dig in Egypt, he finds an ancient papyrus affirming the possibility of achieving eternal life, by drinking the waters of the fountain. Originally, a map was drawn to make the journey easier, but it was later torn apart in four pieces to avoid people abusing the power of it. However, the document tells where their locations. Devram\u2019s Journey begins.<br/>The gameplay includes a randomly generated map, in which it is possible to destroy the terrain around Devram. Moreover, the archaeologist will have to face enemies, that can be attacked and defeated by fighting with\u00a0his shovel, as the player digs furthermore. Both the number and location of the enemies is\u00a0random and it will change each time the level will be restarted or replayed. Lastly, the levels include the presence of two different collectable items: coins, which increase the score, and the map pieces, located at the end of each level and needed to proceed in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d0/9d075a93184e7f388698745bbbc36c0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Rosie_Mable"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
