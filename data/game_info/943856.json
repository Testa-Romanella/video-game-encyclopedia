Or could it turn into\u00a0a nightmare?\u00a0Protect yourself from attacking ghosts in this deck building game. Enhance your deck over time by selecting the best rewards.</p>\n<p>We thought this jam was a great time to check out the newly released Godot 4! Because of this you might need to use Chrome, any you may be out of luck if you use a Mac. Let us know how you fare.</p>\n<p>Tap a card once to select it.\u00a0If it's an aimed attack like a shoe, then select the enemy to target. For other cards, select the card again to use it. An enemy can attack (A) or move (M). Can you beat the fight without damage? Which upgrades are the best to pick?<br/></p>\n<p>It might go without saying, but all of the content in this entry was made by us during\u00a0Godot wild jam 55.
