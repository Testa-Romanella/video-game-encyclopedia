Krumit&#39;s Tale involves the same core deck building mechanics as Meteorfall: Journeys and the same cast of overly optimistic heroes, but expands the \u2018swipe\u2019 mechanic into a dynamic grid based system. This means more depth and longevity \u2013 our heroes will have to choose perks to complement their deck-building strategy and carefully manage the board if they wish to triumph.Features<br />\nUnique roguelike gameplay<br />\nYour hero starts out with a deck of basic cards (items &amp; abilities).  At the start of each dungeon, your hero&#39;s deck is shuffled into the dungeon deck (monsters) and dealt out in a 3x3 grid.  Defeat monsters to earn gold, then use that gold to acquire your items &amp; abilities from the dungeon.  Remove a tile from the dungeon and a new one will be dealt out from the dungeon deck.  After you clear a dungeon, you&#39;ll earn new, powerful cards to add to your deck as well as perks - passive traits that bend the rules of the game.<br />\nColorful characters<br />\nThe exciting and colorful cast of Meteorfall: Journeys (iOS &amp; Android) returns in Krumit&#39;s Tale.  Join your favorite heroes: Bruno, Greybeard, Mischief, Rose and Muldorf as they attempt to defeat the Uberlich in this exciting new adventure.  You&#39;ll also meet Krumit, a mysterious shop owner who trades in magical artifacts.  Why has he summoned you to his shop, and what secrets does he hold?<br />\nUnlockable heroes and cards<br />\nWhen you first visit Krumit, you&#39;ll only be able to select Bruno.  After each run, you&#39;ll earn XP and automatically unlock new characters and cards.
