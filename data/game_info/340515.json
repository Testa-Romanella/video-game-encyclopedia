With the imagination she got, her nights are getting more and more terrifying, and she might not keep her sanity much longer.</p>\n<p>The no-more-so naive Lily decides to face her demons and clean her bad thoughts during the night, repainting them into <strong>lovely pink flowers</strong>. <br/></p>\n<p>But will she be able to <strong>keep this up</strong>\u00a0? <br/></p>\n<p> She needs to face them <strong>4</strong><strong>\u00a0nights</strong>, while staying in touch with what she likes during the daytime in her bedroom.\r\n After this journey, it will finally be over, and Lily could surely fall asleep without any fear again.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\u00a0\r\n<p>Baptiste Bourgoin (UI Designer &amp; Developer)</p>\n<p>Sebastien Gaumin (Pixel-Artist &amp; Developer) <br/></p>\n<p>Harrison Nguyen (Sound Designer &amp; Developer)</p>\n<p>Kamelia Jamaati (GamePlay Designer &amp; Developer)</p>\r\nAssets used\r\n<p>The only assets used are music.
