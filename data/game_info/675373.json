It was built and tested on a 16:9 1080p screen, and sizes any larger or smaller than that may cause issues. Please make sure your browser zoom is at 100%. I am aware that sprites flash (again, Twine limitation), and if you move too fast, the tilemap won\u2019t update until you stop moving. I did my best to mitigate all these issues, though they still remain in some capacity. You may also experience stutters or jitters as you play, as at the end of the day, Twine wasn\u2019t built for this kind of game. I intend to use Godot in the future!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T08:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fe/9fe31d491aaad2bc3a87570197cf7f95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BellyBelting"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
