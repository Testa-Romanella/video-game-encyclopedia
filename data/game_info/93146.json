Get these grades, focus on school, prep for college! Those are the priorities, everything else is secondary! To me, growing up felt like a slew of snap decisions, reflex-reacting to various scenarios, and otherwise not being in full control of my life. To me, it felt like a\u00a0<em>WarioWare</em>\u00a0title. Which brings me to\u00a0<em>School Years</em>!</p>\n<p><em>School Years</em>\u00a0is a quick-paced, pixelated entry into the first CFN Game Jam, for which the theme was \"growing up\". In it, you can experience a not-exhaustive-at-all synopsis of my grade school years, with gameplay heavily inspired by the\u00a0<em>WarioWare</em>\u00a0series. At the end you'll have a tally of wins and losses, the latter of which includes those decisions you let life make for you (namely, when your timer ran out). <br/><br/>Try to take control of school life and make those decisions!</p>\r\nWhy I Made This\r\n<p>My main objective in making this game was to finally complete a project using the Godot game engine. I've been meaning to make a game using the Godot engine ever since hearing/learning about it, with the CFN Game Jam seeming to be a perfect opportunity. It was an absolute treat working with the engine, and 3.0 release definitely deserves the hype.
