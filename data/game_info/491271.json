While not much content, it does set up the story for the up-coming Trilogy in development. That said I hope you enjoy it. This is a JRPG style game, with an emphasis on the storytelling. It features classic side view, turn-based battles with both a Magic and Skill system. Random encounters on the World Map will make you think before setting off on a long journey. While we all enjoy a bit of action, and there is plenty to challenge you, such as an optional boss that will require time and effort, I think nothing grips you better than a good story. And that is what the American Isekai Series will be about. I want the player to feel like they are playing through an Anime, though this game will not feature such elements. Animation is very expensive, and I am saving for the release of the first Game in the Trilogy. While an in-depth story has already been written, I am very interested in the feedback from the STEAM community about the groundwork that has been laid here. I am aware that as it stands this is a cookie cutter RPG, but bear with me as I  wanted feedback while I work on the first game in the trilogy, American Isekai: Season One.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T01:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6a/d6a46d55c6fc8166b7a4a81d1cf21434.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Merle Tester"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["GMV Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
