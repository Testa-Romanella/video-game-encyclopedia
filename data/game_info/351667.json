{"id": 351667, "slug": "charge-3", "name": "Charge", "name_original": "Charge", "description": "You play as a silent protagonist armed with a charge gun, and your ultimate goal is to progress through all levels presented by the game. Each level is a room that has only one exit, and your goal is to overcome any obstacles (such as humanly unreachable platforms or remotely-controlled closed doors) to reach that exit and progress to the next level.<br/><br/>To your help you have charge gun, cube and charge-proof walls (emitting light-blue segments). Charge gun is capable of positively or negatively charging cube and charge-proof walls. Depending on the charges applied, the interaction between them will be different:<br/><ul><li>if cube and wall have opposite charges - cube will attract and eventually static cling to the wall;<br/></li><li>otherwise (alike charges) cube will repel away from the wall.</li></ul>The closer those are, the stronger the effect.<br/>There are major restrictions when it comes to charging objects:<br/><ul><li>cube can either be positively OR negatively charged at the same time, or neutral;<br/></li><li>only one wall charge of the same sign can exist at the same time, and applying new alike wall charge to another location removes old.</li></ul><br/>You will need to figure out how to take advantage of these tools and manipulate objects to progress through. Almost every level forces you to learn a new way of using these tools, and some of the mechanics that you already learned in previous levels are mixed in.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d4a894dd6d43c96c15ab114bd7b614b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mangos"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mangos"], "esrb_rating": null}
