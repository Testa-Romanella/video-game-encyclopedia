But be aware of any dangers within...</p>\n\n<p>The controls are:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>Space/Up/W to jump</p>\n<p>Left mouse button to grapple</p>\n\n<p>I'm pretty pleased with how this game came out myself - mostly because I finished it! It's not too technically interesting or mechanically unique, but it was fun to make, and I hope you have fun playing it. The graphics were a bit of a nightmare to get working and wrangle into something looking nice, although they've grown on me as I've developed the game. I'd love to know what time you got too - I got around 160s on most of my playthroughs, but I'm curious how that compares to everyone else's! Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T16:52:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/195/1959adce7e4562e84610e608bb3e7964.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cakestorm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
