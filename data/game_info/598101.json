The challenge for the player is to wave normally at other AI agents, however, the game doesn't reveal to the player what is objectively normal (i.e. numeric definitions). Instead, the player must figure that out through trial and error, as anyone would when they meet someone new or were introduced to a new friend group. Each AI agent has their own personality and that affects how they will respond to a wave, further complicating what is normal for the player. <br/></p>\n<p>Designed by Cole Pergerson</p>\n<p>Music/SFX by: https://twitter.com/TKWDai<br/></p>\n<p>Mac and Linux coming really soon<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T06:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/426908505816577343d3e56286b7977e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr. Pergerson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
