The objective is to beat 5 cave levels to find the lost record.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\"E\" to interact (with the NPCs, doors, holes or even the little well!);</p>\n<p>\"Space\" to change characters;</p>\n<p>\"Left click\" to attack;</p>\n<p>\"Right click\" or \"F\" to mine;</p>\n<p>\"WASD\" or Arrows to walk.</p>\n<p><strong>Some comments</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>We could not polish as much as we wanted. It is indeed really hard not to overscope in a game jam, but it was fun to do it anyway.</p>\n<p>We are super excited with what we have learned. Thank you so much if you tried the game, it really means a lot!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T10:22:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/448/448f22a4f68a633e6cc92d3cf7f8adf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LittleWells"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
