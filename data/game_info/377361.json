Learn the crafting formulas and collect the scales by battling fish.</p>\n<p>-You can DOUBLE the money you earn by finding PEARLS hidden in CLAMS at the seafloor, but you need to buy a DIVING BELL to look for them.</p>\n<p>-You don't have to WIN every round to advance, but the points add up, and you will NOT RECEIVE ANY POINTS if you fail to catch a fish before time is up, OR if you fail to get at least 3rd place in a round.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T05:20:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60d/60d50485cc1ab15a4806cc5dc7c6ae39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuitsnNukes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
