You can collect strange liquids that will allow you to get upgrades in the shop and make the game easier. The gam can seems hard during the firsts minutes but with some training it becomes easy to reach the 500meters without bonus !</p>\n\n<p>I make the game alone on the code and the design and a friend makes all the sprites of the game. But all the sprites aren't finished yet so the shop is really ugly for now and I'm sorry. I'll soon finish the game and maybe upload it on play store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:50:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a62/a62168f12f99ee9dc58c2829d6aba5a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Antoine Mulliez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
