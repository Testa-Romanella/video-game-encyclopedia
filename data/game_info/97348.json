For money, ideas, of just for lulz - it's up to you.<p>\r\n\tBYTE is a top-down cyberpunk stealth-puzzle game about hackers, networks, and cyber-worms for PC, macOS and Linux.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPlayer (as a too curious script kid) controls a sneaky cyber-worm and performs malicious deeds in the web. The nonlinear narrative takes place in the not distant, internet-dependent future, so the career opportunities are brighter than ever.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCore gameplay may kinda remind of \"Snake\" from your old Nokia phone: every time you steal data, your cyber-worm is getting longer, which makes it harder to control and evade anti-viruses.\r\n</p>Current state<p>\r\n\tRight now the game is in the alpha state. We've prepared a little demo for you to try out what we are making and to hear your opinions! Demo showing off not only the game core mechanics, but the art/sound style, as well as the bit of a story, which takes part in full version of the game's plot.\r\n</p>Plans for the future<p>\r\n\tWe are planning to add asynchronous multiplayer and economics to the game (say \"goodbye\" to release anytime soon). The current vision is: players will able to make and upgrade their own levels (or \"servers\" in game's term), store and sell data, and most importantly \u2013 steal data from one another. The multiplayer part is always-on and completely integrated in singleplayer experience, so you will see on your global map story missions as well as other player's servers.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>Stay tuned with us via:</em><br/>\r\n\tRSS feed and mail subscription on the studio's website: \r\n\tDividebyzer0.com<br/>\r\n\tFacebook page: \r\n\tfb.com/DividebyzerO.team<br/>\r\n\tTwitter page: \r\n\ttwitter.com/dbzteam<br/>\r\n\tOur presskit: \tpress.dividebyzer0.com<br/>\r\nPrivate questions?
