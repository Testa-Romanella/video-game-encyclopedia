It's Darryl.<br/></p>\n<p>I got a job for someone crazy like you.\u00a0Merchant freighter, came out in the middle of no mans land, and spilled billions in cargo. Synth, real good stuff too. I need someone who can pilot a torch ship, one that's been chilled down to the low Ks. Grab the goods without showing up on thermals. You got the steadiest hands and the lowest sense of self preservation of any pilot I know. You up for this?<br/><br/>CONTROLS<br/></p>\n<p>WASD/ARROW KEYS: movement, there is no reverse, this ship doesn't have room for a thrust reverser.<br/>SPACEBAR: Fire off a pellet of engine mass, thermal images will lock onto it, instead of you.<br/></p>\n<p>SHIFT: Drop your mass screen. It'll build up mass and drop your temperature, but you can't fire the engine with it open.<br/></p>\n<p>Get all the blinking cannisters, and get to the gate when it comes in. Note, if you lose in a level, you don't get paid. Zip, Nada. Getting a highscore means betting right on your piloting skills.<br/><br/>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:<br/>Thank you to Reduz, GDQuest, and all the other organizers, maintainers, developers and community members of this awesome project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a95a696aeec1ee9c8581d5937ae0b1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Unwary"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
