During the making of this game I learned a lot of different coding systems. I learned how to code a scoring and lives system, however I took the scoring system out because it wasn't accurate.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhile I was making this game, it originally started out as a minecraft themed game and it slowly changed into a starwars themed game. Because I am in a class with four other people, we all worked on this project together getting ideas from each other, however I did this project much differently then anyone else in my class.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMost people in my class had to hand create every one of there levels which leaves them with not many levels, however I created my levels through coding so I was able to have many more levels then anyone else. There are a total of 6 levels and I will hopefully have a boss level coming soon! If you have any ideas please feel free to leave a comment and let me know about anything you may want me to add!<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a99/a9909bb3a85b8a25ebd0231e6bfccccb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lewisstone85"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
