The build uploaded for the jam does not have consolidated mechanics, what it does have is NOT adherent to the jam's theme and there isn't even\u00a0\u00a0a win state or a lose state. This submission is\u00a0simply a marker of our progress towards a great concept ultimately marred by situations outside of our control - ironically enough - that affected our development through the past 48 hours.*]</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Neurodivergent Heroes</em></strong> is a turn-based lite tactics game where you control a group of heroes that must face a tile-based dungeon filled with enemies to save their prince. The mightiest warriors of the kingdom, however, are actually neuroatypical: Our brave knight happens to have OCD, our cunning Rogue has lived their entire life with ADHD and our wise mage has made lectures on how Asperger has affected their life.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Whilst usually, the way their brain processes things might make others feel like they have no control over their actions, the reality is much simpler: Their brain processes things in a much more amazing way than any of us! Whilst the knight might feel the need to have to hit someone or something every 5 turns, their so-called \u201cdisability\u201d gives them the tactical edge in combat, being able to think ahead with twice or three times the amount of normal moves! The rogue\u2019s hyperfocus, while very situational and sometimes seemingly random, allows them to be experts at what they decide to hyperfocus on. And our incredibly powerful mage gives everything they\u2019ve got - even if they\u2019re not so great with social situations!</p>\n<p>So brave the dungeon, noble heroes! Your enemies expect your best, and little do they know they\u2019ll get more than they were waiting for!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Mouse - Attack if you click on opponent, Move if you click on one of the highlighted tiles\u00a0(If there's still a spotlight on you, it means you can still act. Most likely, you can still attack.)</em></p>\n<p>(Fair warning: There is no win or lose states, no way to pause, no options and no main menu.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Adherence to the Jam's Theme:</em></strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[Reminder! The game is not coherently playable and all of the below represents solely the original, ultimately attainable concept in better circumstances.]</p>\n<p>The game plays on the idea of\u00a0<strong>losing control</strong> so strongly associated to both the myths and the facts of neurodivergent people. We're taught, told and instructed all our lives to\u00a0<strong>control what is inherently ours and ultimately not controllable</strong>. If you attempt to play the game as a simple turn-based tactics game,\u00a0<strong>your party members will quickly attain anxiety and suffer a panic attack</strong>. Literally, it's out of your control how much any of these would affect them. Metaphorically, it instructs you that it's not about controlling their atypical mental acuity - it's about harnessing it! Every party member is incredibly strong under their respective categories!\u00a0</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Resources</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Engine:\u00a0<em>Unity\u00a02019.4.3f1<br/><br/></em></strong><strong>Art:\u00a0<em>PISKEL &amp; Photoshop</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Programming:\u00a0<em>Rider</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sound: Free Assets</strong></p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n<strong><em>Credits</em></strong>\u00a0<br/><br/>Principal Game Design &amp; Spritework:\u00a0Cyber Twilight<br/>Principal Programming &amp; UI/VFX:\u00a0UDany</p>\n<p><strong>Dragon and Toast Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:48:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f16e12fcb696391d803865fc15995752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cyber Twilight"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
