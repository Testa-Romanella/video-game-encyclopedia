This is my first time participating in the GMTK Game Jam, so I'm excited to see how I do! This game was based off a tabletop game I've created two months ago about bouncing dice. It was quite a surprise to see the theme and recalling that game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I can't wait to see how everybody likes the game! I'll create a devlog of the experience making a game in such a short time. Good Luck to everybody else in this game jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/840/840d76fb7c269e284b7187c7cb38906e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slumber1"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
