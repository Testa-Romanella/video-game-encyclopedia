While the graphic and playful implementation is often very good, there is often a lack of really good AI that works tactically and creates interesting situations. That's why we wanted this role to be taken by a player who can observe the situation from an RTS perspective and thus has the opportunity to act more tactically than an AI could.<br/><br/>Although Dark Prospect offers the possibility that the monsters can be controlled by an AI, the clear focus is on PVP.<br/><br/><strong>Play as a soldier (FPS):</strong> In all game modes, it is important to stick together as a team and act tactically. Find better weapons, equipment, and resources to defend yourself against the hordes of monsters controlled by either another player or an AI.<br/><br/><strong>Play as an Overlord (RTS):</strong> Choose from a variety of different monsters and assemble squads. Expand the skills of the overlord and the skills of your monsters. Use your special skills to set a trap for the soldiers and kill them while you control the action from an RTS perspective.<h3>CURRENT FEATURES</h3><ul><li> Host or Join a Game via Steam<br/></li><li> RTS can either be controlled by a player or an AI (Different AI difficulties)<br/></li><li> 3 different maps with unique Settings<br/></li><li> 2 Game modes (<strong>Search and Destroy </strong> and <strong>Defend</strong>)<br/></li><li> <strong>Defend Mode (FPS):</strong> Gather resources, build a base, build weapons and gadgets, survive the attacks<br/></li><li> <strong>Defend Mode (RTS):</strong> Build Units assemble squads, plan your attack, extend the monster abilitys, destroy the soldiers base<br/></li><li> <strong>Search and destroy Mode (FPS):</strong> Search weapons and equipment, find the overlords base and destroy it<br/></li><li> <strong>Search and destroy Mode (RTS):</strong> Build Units assemble squads, Find the soldiers before they find better weapons and equipment , use your special ability to kill them all<br/></li><li> Ingame communication: Quick chat / chat<br/></li><li> Base building<br/></li><li> Crafting and gathering resources<br/></li><li> A variety of weapons and gadgets<br/><br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T09:39:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1eba37a82154c28c64bfb3735acc40d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 383, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CashcowGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CashcowGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
