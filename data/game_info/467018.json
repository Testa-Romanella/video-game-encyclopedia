But, it's not so easy as you thought, the theme of GMTK2020 Game Jam is \"Out Of Control\" so, in regard of that, every room you will need to give up one of your keys/inputs to move on and escape prison.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the use of a key won't be necessary and you'll have to figure it out what key you must take off. But sometimes it will be necessary, so, you have to decide what to take off first and then reset/delete your keyboard by collecting a specific item.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p><p>Art &amp; Design<br/>J\u00falia Rosa<br/>IG: @pinguinsetal</p>\n<p>Additional Art<br/>Felipe Acura<br/>TT: @stereochromia</p>\n<p>Programming<br/>Gustavo Domingues<br/>TT: @bigassoper</p>\n<p>Music &amp; SFX<br/>BoopyTheFox<br/>IG: @boopy.the.fox</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:54:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/024/024c7267e5b4b79187fee8eec1be14be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bigassopper", "nibbid", "J\u00falia Rosa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
