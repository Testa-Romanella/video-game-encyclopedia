Your goal is to colorize all the grey tiles in every level. It starts of pretty easy with small levels and not many wrong turns to make. But as the levels grow bigger the possibilities do as well - a wrong turn at the wrong moment and you might have to start all over again!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game consists of 50 levels that grow in size and difficulty the further you go. If you blaze through the levels with ease, you should consider supporting the game - and get 25 additional levels to satisfy your hunger!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tProgramming, art, sound and music by Tobias Pedersen<br/>\r\n\t12 Bit Gaming, 2017\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you encounter any bug or have any other trouble - feel free to contact me:\r\n</p><p>e-mail:<br/>\r\n\ttwelvebitgaming@gmail.com\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTwitter:<br/>\r\n\t@12BitGaming\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tMore to come:<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Linux version\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t* Walkthrough\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/260/2609fc42edfc79b9808e5c2d4c8e1173.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["12BitGaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
