I wanted to create an experience that would be able to help a large group of individuals no matter the age, cultural expectation, or space limitation they may have. I just wanted to free the user from their current position and display a simple problem that they can in immersive themselves in, interact and solve.   </p>\n<p>What ever the situation the user may be in, the goal of this experience is to have the player bemused in the problem and encourage them to solve them, all while they are immersed into a different setting that is not a doctor\u2019s office, or rehabilitation center. When this objective has been met the truest intention of the application can emerge and that is for the individual to engage in movement to solve the problem at hand.   </p>\n<p>The main mechanics of this application is made to be simple and encouraging. The user will have to grab their player cube and bring it to the goal position. As the player progresses in the game, more game mechanics are applied to give the puzzle a higher level of problem-solving skill all while encouraging player engagement in simple movement that would help in their rehabilitation.   </p>\n<p>The expected movements currently in the prototype are the pronation to supination of the forearm and the flexion and extension of the arm to forearm. Additionally, the puzzles have been rigged to stay within the play area and not fall below or jump away from the players grasp. Understanding that there is limitation in the user motor function, rigging the game objects to simple vector movements will aide and encourage the user to get the main goal.   </p>\n<p>As you can see in the prototype you can move the player cube within the X axis to get to the end goal. As you progress you can see that there are simple obstacles where the user will need to lift and place the obstacles into their socket/restrained position to move the Player cube into the goal point. As we progress new features and more interaction come out where the user will continue using simple movement to further reach the games objective.   </p>\n<p>With this concept established the development of more levels can be applied and grown from the initial application. The addition of levers, pulleys, buttons, two hand interaction can emerge and grow from the application to create new challenges and engage the user to interact and move. Different scenic environments can also be created for the player, as well a level selection for the type of movements that they would want to work.   </p>\n<p>The following is just a prototype and not a complete game, I used the following assets listed below and everything else I designed and programed.   </p>\n<p>Render Knight - Asset Store (unity.com)\r\n  </p>\n<p>WAND AND CIRCLES\r\n  </p>\n<p>Synty Studios - Asset Store (unity.com)\r\n  </p>\n<p>DigitalKonstrukt\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T09:18:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e3fe79d7d293722367f9ad1c07bd6a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeonWard"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
