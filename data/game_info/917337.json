Since the Incident two years ago, the jjimjilbang at the edge of town has sat abandoned. Hana hears rumours that the place is haunted, and as a budding paranormal investigator, she has to check it out. <br/></p>\n<p>But she didn't expect to run into her own ghost. \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>An RPGMaker demo made for Neophyte Studio's Narrative Game Jam #5. 15-30 minutes long; the first slice of a larger dish. <br/></p>\n<p>In this stage of development, Jjimjilbang\u00a0is more of an RPG with horror theming than a proper horror game. It will have some heavier themes in the future, but for now, it's just retro RPG fun.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD </strong>or arrow keys for movement</p>\n<p><strong>Enter </strong>to interact with objects <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Esc </strong>to escape out of menus<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lorcan</strong> for art, music,  and concept</p>\n<p><strong>Mal </strong>for narrative design and databasing<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T09:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/034/0346a3cd533df634a71699084cea1b3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VaporwaveGothicStudio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
