Before you start playing, you can create an AI using a simple, visual, block-based coding language. While you play, the AI takes over every so-often, for increasingly long times, so you the better you write the AI, the longer you can survive.</p>\n<p><strong>(Play on fullscreen for the best experience)</strong><br/></p>\n<p> <strong>How to play<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The in-game controls are simple: WASD to move, and use your mouse to aim and fire at the enemies.</p>\n<p>The AI is a bit harder:</p>\n<p><em>(If you need an example for an AI, there is one in the first screenshot)<br/></em></p><p>(Dragging is a bit broken, when you create a new block, the first time dragging it doesn't link it properly, you need to drag it twice.)<br/></p>\n<p>At the start there are two nodes, On Start and On AI Loop<strong>.\u00a0</strong>These are both functions; you can also make your own functions. On Start is executed once before everything else, on AI loop is executed every frame while the AI is active. When a function is executed every block under it is executed in order. It should be simple to understand what every block does. There are two important things: variables should always have a name consisting of only letters and the value can only be a number. If statements are a bit complicated, and when their set condition is met, they call a function with the name that is in in statement.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Sound Credits<br/></strong>8Bitgunshot by Soundholder<br/>Ammo pickup by zivs<br/>Short explosion by ProjectsU012<br/>All are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T08:16:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a33/a33797817b1e4d38551896c6d27dc4db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["JustGamingNL"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
