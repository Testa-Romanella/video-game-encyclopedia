Greatly enhanced post-7DRL version is available for download.</strong>)<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>\"Newly anointed acolyte: You have pledged, before our Eternal Guide, the contracts that bind you. And now, your mission: to descend, below the temple, to purge it of the corruption lurking within. Go with guidance, and uphold your Oath.\"<br/></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Acolyte's Pledge</strong> </em>is a traditional-style roguelike. It's a turn-based dungeon crawl into the depths of a long-forgotten temple to discover what dwells beneath. Along the way, you'll have to face and survive a host of creatures, some hostile, some not.</p>\n<p>You play as an acolyte, the lowest level of paladin, empowered by your deity with the strength to vanquish the unholy and restore peace to the world. At least, that's what you believed, when you took up your Oath.</p>\n<p>Each run in <em><strong>Acolyte's Pledge</strong></em>, you will have take a slightly different Oath, granting you a boon from the divine. But if your faith weakens and you violate that oath, or break it entirely, that boon, and your deity's favor, will be lost. And soon after, perhaps you will be too.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>(Windows 7DRL Users: There's something weird going on with the window sizing, so it could become absurdly full-screen.
