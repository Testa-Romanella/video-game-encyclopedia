Do the mac and linux versions run? The world may never know.<br/><br/>Controls<br/>Move \u2014 WASD or Arrow Keys <br/>Talk \u2014 Space Bar<br/><br/>This year marks my third Global Game Jam!\r\n  I decided to use this as an opportunity to finally learn how to make a 3D game in Unity, so there aren't any true gameplay mechanics this time around. Rather, it's more of a short narrative. I tried to go for the pomp tone of the 19th century for the diversifier, but I'm not quite sure if it came out that way.</p>\n<p>Admittedly the theme for this year was very difficult; home is not really a concept for me. It\u2019s a feeling many second generation immigrants can possibly understand (although technically I\u2019m a first generation immigrant, most would label me as ABC despite the fact that I have no rights to run for president). Being perceived as too Chinese by America and too American by China, there\u2019s a gap in both countries. <br/></p>\n<p>Amplifying this feeling, I\u2019ve lived in eight different areas, and moved many more times than that. I\u2019ve never felt that I\u2019ve had anywhere to call a \u2018hometown.\u2019 I hate the question \u201cwhere are you from?,\u201d not only because of the inevitable \u201cno, where are you really from?\u201ds, but also because I don\u2019t even have an American area I can comfortably respond with. <br/><br/>Incidentally, since I moved recently, there weren\u2019t any jam locations near me this year, so I just did it at home.\u00a0It turned out to be appropriate for the theme I guess.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t originally plan on doing GGJ this year, but I\u2019m glad I did.\u00a0 So that I could submit my game to the official website, I joined the largest jam site in the state, thinking I could blend in. Cheers and thanks to NJIT,\u00a0 hope I didn\u2019t weird you out!<br/><br/>Additional thanks to the following resources\u2014<br/>Dialogue tutorial from Brackeys<br/>Water sound from CGEffex<br/>Fire sound from dobroide<br/>Forest sound from felix.blume<br/>Wind sound from InspectorJ<br/>Ocean sound from michaelkoehler<br/>Leaves sound from Mjeno<br/>Reception sound from MorneDelport<br/>Character controller tutorial from Single Sapling Games<br/>Tower sound from xzuma<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T03:55:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/5036cb1ee1ed52012bf3ff80145d6afe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JoJo Lu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
