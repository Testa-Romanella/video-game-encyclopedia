In order to enhance the game experience, the levels and values \u200b\u200brequired for some data have been modified.<br/>\r\nThe game is divided into three entrances: Normal, Nightmare, and Hell. Enemies that are immune to different types of damage will gradually appear at the entrance of Nightmare and Hell. Rainbow Jewelry and Halo (not yet online) can break the immunity. In the following different entrances, you can get different amounts of gold coins, diamonds, experience, and general points.<br/>\r\nRage system:<br/>\r\n1) There are 6 types of anger: normal attack, shield, fire, lightning, cold, poison.<br/>\r\n2) Normal attacks and shields must bring anger, and other elemental damages are added according to the damage type of the player character.<br/>\r\n3) There are several balls at the bottom left of the game. When attacking or being attacked, the anger value will increase.<br/>\r\n4) When the anger value reaches a certain value, click to release, during which the anger will be consumed at a rate of 10% per second.<br/>\r\n5) During the release of anger, the gain of anger will no longer be increased.<br/>\r\n6) During the release of anger, the damage skills corresponding to anger will be improved, and the shield will receive global damage reduction, up to 100%, effective for all damage.<br/>\r\n7) Different rage values \u200b\u200bcan trigger different skill types, and each type has 4 attack skills.<br/>\r\nGeneral system:<br/>\r\n1) The protagonist can choose between male and female, and can carry up to 5 generals.<br/>\r\n2) Both generals and protagonists can be fully equipped with the same equipment.<br/>\r\n3) The consumption of equipment durability is the same for the protagonist and generals.<br/>\r\n4) Both the protagonist and generals have normal attack and skill attack, and each general has its own skill attack damage type.<br/>\r\n5) The unlocking of generals needs to meet the points requirements, and the points can be obtained by killing the boss corresponding to the character.<br/>\r\n6) The points given by the boss are different in different difficulties: 1 point for normal, 2 points for nightmares, 5 points for hell, doubled in death mode.<br/>\r\nAttack distance:<br/>\r\n1) Since the current game form is a battle formation, players cannot control the movement of characters in the battlefield.<br/>\r\n2) The attack distance is calculated according to the front and rear distance positions of the battle formation, and the distance will be reduced by 1 every time a row of enemies is found forward.<br/>\r\n3) Added the concept of adding 1 horse and subtracting 1 horse: -1 horse, the effect is -1 when you calculate the distance from others; +1 horse, the effect is +1 when others calculate the distance from you. There is a value of 2 at most, which enhances the offensive and defensive positions.<br/>\r\nPet system:<br/>\r\n1) Pets provide attribute bonuses such as blood recovery and mana recovery for all teams in the battle formation through the aura.<br/>\r\n2) Pets can only be equipped on the protagonist. If the protagonist is killed, the pet aura will be invalid.<br/>\r\nDeath Mode:<br/>\r\n1) All reward attributes (gold coins, diamonds, experience, military commander points, acquisition of magic equipment, etc.) are doubled.<br/>\r\n2) However, in this mode, the generals killed by the player will die and can no longer participate in the game, and the equipment on the dead character will also be lost.<br/>\r\n3) Players can forcibly dismiss the game to avoid death, but only if all equipment or props in the backpack are lost.<br/>\r\n4) Players cannot leave the battle in the combat state, and cannot advance or leave the game. Can only be forced to disband or forward teleportation.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T03:29:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/741/7416e49866c8b13dd3baed3238c9fd9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["First Dimension"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["First Dimension"], "esrb_rating": null}
