There isn't an explicit victory nor defeat, but I guess that you will know what is and what isn't either of both (I also made sure that there weren't \"dead ends\"). The game is pretty short, but there is a different ending for each combination of choices, so try as many as you want.\u00a0Just requires a keyboard.</p>\n<p>I worked on it alone and\u00a0thought hadn't that much time, so I had to cut out a lot of ideas and focus on transmit the essence clearly (also, didn't find music nor sounds that went right with the game, so it's mute). I think it's fine as the demo it is\u00a0\ud83d\udc4d</p>\n<p>By the way, you can check my youtube channel here (there I upload my music and little more):\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3SVl7OFdGcDlmMZbRDHhMQ/featured</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6d/c6d98b18cf453880194b3bd3598daf13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jorvan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
