(English and German translations available for this deck at this time)<br/><br/>Winner of the 2013 Board Game of the Year from Pocket Tactics!<br/><br/>Europe is recovering from some hard times. You and a spouse must grow your 2-room hut and empty farmyard into a productive farm. You must sow and reap, raise animals and expand your family in order to thrive. Europe in the 17th century: a tough time to be a farmer!<br/><br/>Agricola is a family-friendly strategy game. Simple to understand and great fun, Agricola lets everyone play to the end in a race to see who can build the most productive farm.<br/><br/>Easy To Play<br/>Agricola is a turn-based game, played in six Stages and 14 Rounds. On a turn, players place a family member token on a location in town in order to collect resources or to take actions to improve their farm. They can get building materials such as Wood and Clay, plow fields and sow crops, or build fences to keep animals. New actions become available at the start each round and resources get replenished on any taken in the previous round.<br/><br/>At harvest crops are reaped, newborn animals arrive and you must feed your family. Growing your family gives you more actions but means you have more mouths to feed!<br/><br/>The player with the most productive and advanced farm at the end of 14 rounds is the winner. Victory points are awarded for the number of fields and pastures you have, as well as for crops and animals. Additional points are awarded for extension and renovation of the family\u2019s home, for the number of family members, and for played Occupation and Improvement cards.
