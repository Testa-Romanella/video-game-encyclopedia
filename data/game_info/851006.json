To do that, you need to fill the box's\u00a0edges horizontally or vertically, causing the blocks to disappear.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you add blocks that don't fit, you lose health. If you run out of health, the game is over.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Blocks will gradually move from a random direction\u00a0towards the box. The further you get into the game, the faster they will go.\u00a0You can also manually force blocks into the box using\u00a0the d-pad. Pressing the up button will add the upper blocks, pressing the right button will add the blocks on the right, and so on.</p>\n<p>You can rotate the box using both the crank and the A and B buttons. Rotating the crank forward or pressing the A button will rotate the box clock-wise. Rotating the crank backward or pressing the B button will rotate the box counter clock-wise.</p>\n<ul><li>Use the <em>crank</em> or press <em>A</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>B</em> to rotate the box</li><li>Use the <em>d-pad</em> to add blocks to the box</li></ul>\r\nPoints\r\n<p>Points are\u00a0earned by clearing the edges of the box. Clearing multiple edges simultaneously gives a higher score. If clearing the edges results in an empty box, you get twice a many points.\u00a0In addition to earning points, clearing\u00a0all 4 edges gives you extra health. These are the points you get:</p>\r\nEdges clearedPoints without empty boxPoints with empty box120402501003801604175350\r\nLevels\r\n<p>You start at level 1 and every thousand points, you go up a level. So, first at 1000, then at 2000 etc. When you go up a level, you get extra health. When the level increases, the speed of the blocks moving towards the box also increases.\u00a0The higher the level, the faster they go!</p>\n<p>Comments, questions,\u00a0bug reports, etc. \u2014 all\u00a0welcome.\u00a0Thanks for playing!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Game over</em> sound effect by Davit Masia.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T10:38:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/006831e9113694b13d9e9a1283d82533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luca5"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
