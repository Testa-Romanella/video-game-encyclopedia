Stay at their level, then grab a speed booster to push them to the bottom of the screen! The racing game that gets faster and faster until somebody is left behind!</p>\n<p>Player 1: Use WASD</p>\n<p>Player 2: Use Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Author's Note (for whomever it may concern): At the moment, I've completed the game with everything but the kitchen sink. And the music. But in all seriousness, this was originally intended as a single player puzzle game, but when I realized that wouldn't be done on time, I panicked and rebooted the concept. Only had time to playtest it by myself (which isn't exactly ideal), so I'd be happy if somebody could play with a friend and let me know if it's any fun. Thank you for visiting, have a good day or night.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a34fbc5a07157249f116f472894e497.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LittleFieryOne"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
