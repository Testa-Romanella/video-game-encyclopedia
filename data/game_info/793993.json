Show those adventurers who's really in charge, and maybe reclaim some of their pilfered fortune.</p>\n<p>Goofy Gauntlet is a twist on the arcade dungeon crawler. Gameplay takes cues from both Atari's <em>Gauntlet </em>and Sega's <em>Alien Syndrome</em>. Your goblin is built like a tank, and they control like one too. Keep an Eye on the direction they face, and destroy enemy camps to cease their endless conquest. Look out for scattered keys and power-ups\u2014 you're gonna need them!</p>\n<p>This prototype was created in a semester during my time at RIT studying game design and development. I chose to work on it solo to get a better handle on Unity and exercise what I had learned so far about design and project planning.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>left/right arrows: rotate eyes</p>\n<p>up/down arrows: move forwards and backwards</p>\n<p>space: fire\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T07:51:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83a/83a26854f9d6d15af300c38f041b93e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoolSummit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
