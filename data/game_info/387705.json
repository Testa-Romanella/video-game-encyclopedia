It\u2019s a story\u00a0set during the timeline of Volume 1 through to Volume 3, developed in\u00a0Ren\u2019Py\u00a0and runs on Windows, Linux and\u00a0Android Phones. Depending on how many and which bonds you will have made during your semester at Beacon Academy,\u00a0you may influence the ending of the storyline and even canon events from the show. I invite you\u00a0to support the original release by Rooster Teeth.</p>\n<p>Team CBLT is also a mod for Meinos Kaen\u2019s own VN, Project JPDE, and uses many of the resources he has collected for his game. I\u2019ve just commissioned some resources of my own, and put a whole new story in place of the old one Meinos is writing. I also invite you to check out his work, and I\u2019ll post some links as to where you can follow its development.</p>\n<p>CBLT Links:</p>\n<p><strong>The CBLT Discord</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The CBLT Patreon<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The CBLT Twitter</strong></p>\n\n<p>JPDE Links:</p>\n<p><strong>The JPDE Discord</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The JPDE Patreon</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Meinos\u2019 Twitter Account</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Meinos\u2019 Newgrounds Account</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bc/9bcfb87c1348812686edede0049a9acf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["DinoMan21779"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
