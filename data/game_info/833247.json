{"id": 833247, "slug": "remnants-of-calandria", "name": "Remnants of Calandria", "name_original": "Remnants of Calandria", "description": "<p>Remnants of Calandria \u00a0is a short one-hour-long RPG Maker MV game submission to the 2022 Indie Game Maker Contest: Rebirth. It is a short top-down action-exploration game  with a real-time battle system, about prowling through the remains of a  destroyed land and the small civilization that's managed to recover from  it.\r\n</p>\n<p>You play as Hiro, a mute guard-in-training for the town.  Hiro doesn't socialize well, and in turn most people don't have a high  opinion of Hiro, preferring to more colorful addresses like \"creep\",  \"weirdo\", \"kid\", and more. However, one friend has stood alongside for  many years--Saki. Saki is the opposite of Hiro, outgoing and talkative,  curious and investigative, and both of them have grown up alongside each  other.\r\n</p>\n<p>Saki wants to go out to investigate the world that's forbidden to both of them.\r\nWill you accompany her?</p>\n\n<p>I submitted this game 5 minutes before the deadline. Please allow me to write a better description later when I am not exhausted.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T16:48:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02fc22f318330995c44666fa17597799.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TerminusEst13"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
