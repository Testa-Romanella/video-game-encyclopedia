Explore it, if you dare...<br/><br/>Originally made for Ludum Dare in 2016. I'm very proud of the result, although I cheated while making it by using some pre-made code and spending more time on the project than allowed by the competition. The game had some nasty bugs and I thought it'd make sense to re-release it on itch with fixes to those.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:40:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb2/fb26d1997dcd1b9ca4a43aebb51dbb8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hempuli"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
