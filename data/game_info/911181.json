V1 (Browser)", "description": "<p>Infi Islands! is an infinite runner game where the player has to jump from one platform to another. The player is also given a choice to take the mushroom or avoid it; the use of the mushroom is to slow down the player. But, the player also has to avoid being too slow or their jumps would be too low to reach the other platform.</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Asset/s Used:\r\n</p>\n<p>Unity Free Asset -\u00a0Cute 2D -\u00a0College Student\r\n</p>\n<p>Unity Free Asset - 2D Match Three Icon Pack\r\n</p>\n<p>Unity Free Asset - 2D Jungle Side-Scrolling Platformer Pack\r\n</p>\n<p>Unity Free Asset - Customizable Skybox\r\n</p>\n<p>Unity Free Asset - 2D Handcrafted Art\r\n</p>\n<p>Unity Free Asset - Fatality FPS Gaming Font\r\n</p>\n<p>Music/s Used:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Colossal Music Epic Orchestral Battle Music</strong>\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>Makai Symphony</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Love Waltz</strong>\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>Nikos Spliotis Music\u00a0\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T16:09:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c82/c82c9f339731dbfe3e4c499a9717c745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ishidaru"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
