My goal with this was to create a lighthearted and surrealist experience to combine humor with the warmth and comfort you get when sitting down for a nice slice of cheesy pie. I hope that the story I have written and the areas you can explore can evoke some sort of emotion and get the great national pizza debate going, as we don\u2019t have enough to argue about as a society.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T10:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/1657cdc98d3c3f13dddc6be7e985265a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SnortableCola"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
