Higher spin means doing more damage to the enemy, but it goes down on colliding. Balance stops damage from getting through on a hit and raising it protects you. However, you can't control your top and increase spin or balance at the same time! Choose wisely!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c3/6c360d322a7ebc6fbfcda614d6433ffa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ashton Hunter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
