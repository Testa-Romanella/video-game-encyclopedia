The idea was for movement\u00a0to be more like asteroid in it's handling but the first draft made the turn speed go off the rails so I pitched it down and made it so it was easier to course\u00a0correct with just the thruster force alone. Also I re-centered everything and fixed the music so it continues even after the game resets. Also I\u00a0made it so the last part of the instructions wasn't hidden. The way the text box was shaped and the text was written cause the player 2 shoot prompt to be cut off. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T10:02:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73a/73add7c3939da5f2605fc1372f2b2365.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The JL ZONE"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
