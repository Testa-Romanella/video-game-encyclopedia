But since it is gonna be a mobile game i wanted to design it such a way that it will be\u00a0\u00a0simple as possible, and has easy to understand mechanics.</p>\n<p>To be honest it is a very huge project to work alone because implementing things on the game takes so much time due to client-server-database structure. I had to code everything by my own. But i already finished the core mechanics of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will talk about what i've done so far and later of that part, i will talk about what i am gonna need for future of this project. I really want to publish it somehow so let's start.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Network Packets</strong></p>\n<p>These are the data structures i designed for communication between server side and client side. If i need to simplify they are basically action that we can do on the game, and these are the response and request packets. Each time we do something on game, client creates an instance of required packet and after filling inside it, sends to the server. Then server also does the same and send a reply back, it goes like that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Crypthography</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course we can't send network packages without creating a safe connection between server and client side, because our network packets carrying sensitive information that shouldn't be seen from the outside. So we are encrypting every data we are sending to the server. I am not gonna go in the details about that but on TheAwakening i am using both RSA and AES encryption methods.(RSA for creating secure connection and AES for the rest of the data)</p>\n\n<p>So far the things i have showed was shared files, which means both server and client has these scripts and able to use them, but after this point i will show specific implementations. Let's start with Server side.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Server Listeners</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>These server listeners scripts are responsible for reading packages coming from client side, every network package has an operation code so after server listeners get this code they forward the request to the appropriate methods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Database Interfaces</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>These are the interfaces for database functions, since they are an interface it is easy to implement on different databases. On my project i am currently using MongoDB for storing my data, but it is also possible to use another database system. At the end i tried to make these scripts independent as possible so implementing new things are easy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Database Models</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>These are the data structures using for communication between database and server side. They are basically containers and server side always using them for reading data from the database and also writing data to database.</p>\n\n<p>And this is the visual representation of these database models on the MongoDB Compass, they are holding every important data of the game.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's talk a bit about the client side and i will show you what kind of user interfaces i have designed so far.(These user interfaces are just prototype, it is not end work)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Login Screen</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>New Player Screen</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Main Screen</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>There are also another windows but since they need data to fill inside them i am not able to take screenshots of them for now.</p>\n<p>So far i spent so much time for this project and i really want to publish it, get monetization etc. But as you can see here it is not completed project and still has a lot to work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Things Needed to Finish The Project</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Character Designs - The game has a theme and it needs character designing according to that. There is also gonna need an artist for drawing environment. I imagined these characters 2D and they will have rigging to have the feeling of action.</li><li>UI Designs - I already drawed how the user interface will gonna look but of course i need someone to make it alive, work on them. These designs should be very basic and also very easy to use.</li><li>Publisher - I don't have much information about publishing and marketing but for this project we are gonna definitely need a publisher. Also we need advertisement for gathering player community.</li><li>Tester Team - After the functionalities of game finished we will need a tester team to play our game and we need to get feedback from them.</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you have any ideas or wanna take place on the project please contact me via email.</p>\n<p>tahasokmen222@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T05:41:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/989/98906e41413be58f4351b467ceb695d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustRelaxable"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
