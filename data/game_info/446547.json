It is fairly stable but please take that into consideration.\r\n<p>IFM is a\u00a0general manager-style game for indoor football fans on Windows PC computers.\u00a0This game can be played in single player but is likely much more fun when you play versus your friends in an online league (hosting/ftp is required and not provided). There currently is no available game guide but I will work on one when I\u00a0get a chance.\u00a0There may be some items that are not available within the game. I am a full-time employee and student working on this game in limited free time. I\u00a0will work to fix bugs and add new elements to the game in that limited free time, so please be patient with me as I work on this huge project alone. I\u00a0cannot promise weekly updates, but I will do my best to fix bugs and post an update at least monthly.</p>\n<p>Please note; there is a minimum resolution requirement of 1366x768.</p>\n<p>This game is in active development (and is very likely a long way from being completed) and the files currently posted are from the alpha version.\u00a0 Please report any issues/bugs with the game to: rob@onlinesports.network.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: I may be looking for an associate developer that is familiar with C# and WPF;\u00a0feel free to email me at the email address provided if you are interested in assisting with the development of Indoor Football Manager.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:56:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1badec81abd6e0e9de319dfc44608bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robmeister89"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
