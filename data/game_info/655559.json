For every golden bonbon that enters your arena you will get one point. While that sounds easy, stay alert! After being open for too long, the pipes will start dropping bad, violet candy. While golden bonbons disappear, violet ones don't. If there are too many bad bonbons, the game ends. To avoid this, close the pipes with a plug before your arena drowns in bonbons!\u00a0<br/>Good luck :)</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/>You pick can up the plugs with one of the interact keys and then place it onto a pipe or drop it back on the ground. The longer the pipe is open the higher is the chance it will dispense bad candy and the overall difficulty will raise over time. If too much purple candy lays on the ground the game ends. Try to get the best score you can get by plugging the pipes before purple candy enters. Only the orange ones award points ^^</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>WASD - Move<br/>Q, E, F, M1 or M2 - Interact (pick up/place/drop plugs)<br/>1, 2 - previous/next Song</p>\n<p>We created this game as a team of two in just the week of the Game Jam.
