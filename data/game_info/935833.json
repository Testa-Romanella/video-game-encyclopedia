For the browser mode it's recommended to use fullscreen.</p>\n<p>It's a platformer and shooter combined. You can also get balloons to be able to float further than you'd normally be able to jump! Watch out for the bees though, as they will pop your balloon. To get rid of them, you have a gun! Watch out however, as this gun can also pop your balloon. You have a limited supply of balloons!</p>\n<p>Get to the yellow diamond at the end of the level to complete the game.</p>\n\n<p>Please keep in mind this game is extremely scuffed, and there's no sound.</p>\n<p>Berry's YouTube<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T17:55:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95f/95ff033c7b6f1081533eca451a10181d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["wouterb14"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
