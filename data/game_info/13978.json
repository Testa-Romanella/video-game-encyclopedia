{"id": 13978, "slug": "brush-up-vr", "name": "Brush Up VR", "name_original": "Brush Up VR", "description": "Brush Up VR is a simple Toothbrushing challenge game. It is derived from the Brush Up mixed reality mobile game. Developed with NIH support, Brush Up wins health gaming awards (like the 2015 Innovation in Games and Simulation award from America\u2019s prestigious Institute of Medicine) for teaching young children toothbrush mastery.  While the mixed reality game is a bathroom companion, the VR game is a fun exploration of dentition. Kids learn that brushing means a lot more than cleaning the front teeth plus a quick scrub down one side. Designed for young people of any age -- the brushing challenge is lively fun for anyone.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/867/867241455bb2b00f80af3395ad10ec37.jpg", "website": "http://www.brushupgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games That Work"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Games That Work"], "esrb_rating": null}
