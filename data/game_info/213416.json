Be careful not to miss or hit one of your humble townsfolk, or you'll lose a soul! If you run out of souls, well, you die! The more blood you collect, the better daggers you can purchase, thus increasing your blood harvest speed. </p>\n<p>Every 100 goats you slay, you will gain the trust of the neighbouring Warlocks, as they join you with the build up of the Goat Ritual. Reach 500 Goats Slain, and 100000 Blood to successfully complete the ritual. Good Luck.</p>\n\n<p>Programming - Daniel Crewdson</p>\n<p>Art - Danny Dale-Tucker / Georgia Higgins</p>\n<p>Design - Ben Percival</p>\n<p>Sound / Music - Mike Martin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d40/d4029091ade9d23316242a195148ac7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Crewdson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
