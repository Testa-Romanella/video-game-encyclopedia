Fight your way through randomly generated dungeons and complete randomized quests.

Each creature has its own unique abilities which directly affect the way you play the game.<br/>- Cast over 100 powerful spells to turn the tide of battle.<br/>- Fight in challenging battles that reward thoughtful strategy rather than mindless button mashing.<br/>- Upgrade your castle to add new rooms, to unlock new creatures, and to entice new citizens to live in your kingdom.<br/>- Craft and enchant equipment to augment your creatures' power or to grant them new abilities. There are over 500 different crafting materials to collect and use.<br/>- Craft powerful eggs which will someday hatch into extremely powerful creatures.<br/>- Fight in your kingdom's battle arena for fame, fortune, and glory.<br/>- Infinite playability. Unlike other RPGs, there is no level cap, no restrictions, and the game never ends. Want to play until your character is level 937? Go for it.<br/>- A roguelike RPG overworld where you can see your enemies approaching before battle begins.<br/>- Free to play until your character reaches level 15. After that, the game costs $4.99 USD to play forever. There are no cash shops, microtransactions, or anything like that all.<br/><br/>Siralim is different from other monster catching RPGs in that the focus is on gameplay rather than story. The game is much more difficult and offers more room for customization thanks to its subtle roguelike elements.
