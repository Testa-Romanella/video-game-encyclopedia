{"id": 486802, "slug": "iron-rooftops", "name": "Iron Rooftops", "name_original": "Iron Rooftops", "description": "<p><strong>IRON ROOFTOPS</strong></p>\n<p>Your one objective is to get the highest score.\u00a0Rack up those points by traveling far across the rooftops, smashing into any enemies in your path.</p>\n<p>The Grappling Hook is a very powerful tool\u00a0in your arsenal!\u00a0Use it to\u00a0latch onto almost any solid object. When you latch on, you gain a push/pull towards that object \u00a0and you can fling yourself around, controlling your movement, even while zooming across the rooftops.\u00a0Combining a double jump in the air and making the right adjustments is absolutely devastating for your enemies.</p>\n<p>Proficiency with the Grappling Hook may make you the IRON ROOFTOP DOMINATOR.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>WALKERS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>--------------------------------</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Walkers are dumb, but very angry enemies. They\u00a0walk back and forth guarding their rooftop. If you try and smash into one from the side, then\u00a0you will get poked and take damage. Instead,\u00a0attack them from the top and you might just get off scot-free.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>GHASTS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>--------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>Ghasts stay on their perch, guarding the skies and attacking anybody who gets near. They are weak and can easily be defeated with a quick and offensive attack before they can react. However, if you are too slow and let them set their\u00a0target\u00a0and charge up their beam, then\u00a0\u00a0you will take damage. The perches that Ghasts sit on can be grappled onto and will not collide with you if you go through. Perches are great ways to\u00a0get across the rooftops and combine jumps onto other enemies.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDIT:</strong></p>\n<p>https://shin-soku.tumblr.com/</p>\n<p>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Rolemusic<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>HIGH SCORES</strong></p>\n<p>Share your High Score and it will be added!<br/></p>\r\nDigitalScorpian49767", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T02:38:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d3/0d33ba2922a14a46a95e4e85d0480de1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DigitalScorpian"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
