Collect coins to have speed increased. Enemies grows faster if you touch them. Health is not maxed and map is limited (i dont know how i can set infinite tiles without breaking it)<br/>the game is meant to have no sound. I find it better than forcing a sound that can be annoying<br/><br/>please remember is my first game, i know its simple and maybe silly but its just something i liked doing it, for the first time.<br/><br/>Asset: Edited Background, Named \"gridbox protytpe\" from\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/gridbox-prototype-ma...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T07:15:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc7567cf63a34298c2e9b108fb65797.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kayckbr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
