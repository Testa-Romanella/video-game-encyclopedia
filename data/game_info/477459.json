Glitched Escapist</p>\n<p>Note: this game was made for the mini game jam and the theme was crime. there was also a limitation that said that pausing had to be a core mechanic of the game. i did not know that until the last day of the jam though sadly. while pausing may not be the core mechanic of the game, it does give you one of the endings. plz dont delete my game\u00a0hehe.</p>\n<p>the music for the game was made by a\u00a0 great pal of mine! here is his youtube channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCogcP7aRTGIyGzr-oTuhAgw</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:03:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/731/73132b4883d1d63b5c0a721c5bdaa3e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dud3rdude"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
