It's based on the XKCD comic of the same name (created by Randall Munroe, available under CC-BY-NC 2.5). When you jump, gravity stops applying after you reach a stable height and you gliiiiide. (In other words, you jump and gravity only reduces your vertical velocity to zero.) Physics in Jump is slightly more forgiving than in the comic: you can still move around while in the air, so mistakes are less costly. This can be disabled.</p>\n\n<p>Project available under GPLv3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/edac2bb69250064c674557418d7f9a9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arc676"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
