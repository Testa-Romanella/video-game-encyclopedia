The 3 SchoolQuest games were made at school in a single day each. What's Up was made in a day at home, and Null Manifesto was the pioneering zine, and took several months to complete for personal reasons obvious in the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've moved on from making games like this and have slowly been working on much different games. I frame these games as parts of a whole experience and mindset, and would like to see them as one cohesive compilation. </p>\n<p>These games can be very disjointed, incoherent, or upsetting, but are mostly short and benign. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c5155b4bb9f7e942b88ee943cb9fd32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Demon Garden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
