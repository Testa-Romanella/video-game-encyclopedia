She/Her. He/Him.) </strong>- They are the heir to the throne of Aslerea and your betrothed. But it\u2019s the last thing they want to be. They seem to hold something against you. They are serious and spend hours upon hours training\u2014they\u2019re preparing for something. Their engagement to you is quite the hinder, but can you make them see it differently? Their duty blinds them, but you can change that.\r\n</li><li><em>The Pirate Captain, Rhys/Rhea.</em><strong> (Gender Selectable. She/Her. He/Him.) </strong>- They are a mystery. They are a pirate\u2014the very embodiment of freedom and sea, yet they choose to remain in the kingdom of Aslerea more often than not. They stand to gain something by being there, but you don\u2019t know what. There\u2019s something in you that tells you that you can\u2019t trust them, but their smile is so pretty, and their flirtation so constant that you want to. But maybe\u2014just maybe, if you play your cards right\u2014they will treat you as tenderly as their dearest treasure.\r\n</li><li><em>The Shadow, Calixta/Calix.</em><strong> (Gender Selectable. She/Her. He/Him.)</strong> - They are your betrothed\u2019s younger sibling, and so no one pays quite as much attention to them. Though they seem content in their sibling\u2019s shadow\u2014content with their lack of responsibility\u2014you can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s more to it. They are as lazy as a bump on a log, and they likely sleep more than anything else\u2014but there\u2019s an interest in their eyes when they look at you. Is it something deep, or just a longing to claim what their sibling has? You could find out.\r\n</li><li><em>The Tutor, Mestra/Mestrn.</em> <strong>(Gender Selectable. She/Her. He/Him.) </strong>- They are assigned as your tutor and tasked with the great undertaking of making you fit to lead. But they are also close with the people in the palace, and help the servants when they can. They know commoners by name and spend nights in the tavern, surrounded by free drinks. And while they are kind, there is something beneath it all that suggests a person that will go far to protect those they care about. Whether it\u2019s because of their kind nature or something else, they have no enemies.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>If you're interested in learning more about the story or characters, or just simply following the development of this story, go to my Tumblr, here.</strong></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T06:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2dff3adf26bb442c4396bcb555b65e36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["magicalwrittenwords"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
