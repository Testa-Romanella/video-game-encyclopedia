{"id": 731874, "slug": "corruption-time", "name": "Corruption Time", "name_original": "Corruption Time", "description": "<p>In a world full of corruption, some one must do something. You play titular character Female Dummy. Find the corruption nodules and fend off the dreaded Male Dummies and Foslex (large dummies). Once you have found all of the corruption nodules, the true path of enlightenment\u00a0will show itself. Do not be fooled to think it is an easy journey to get there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are a master of time. Use your slow time ability to reduce time all around you. You are slightly resistant to this. Your arms move slow like the rest of time; however, your legs have become accustom to this time warp. With every slain enemy, your time to complete your task increases.\u00a0 If you fall, you will get back up and try again.\u00a0</p>\r\nDesigner Notes\r\n<p>I made this short project in one week while streaming most of the process on Twitch. The process took me about 25 hours. After figuring out movement for 4 hours, I worked heavily in animations and UI to represent everything that happens in game. I was unable to fix some issues (see below), and I did not put together any sounds or music for the game, unlike my last project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wish I was stronger with attack animations as I think they are pretty janky. However, Mixamo still did wonders to give me an edge up in this short project. I think the project came together pretty well and was fun to make and play. On several occasions I found myself playing with level design and balancing on the last day. The ending cinematic was one of my favorite things to put together. It helped wrap up the game and felt more like a complete game versus the original hard cut after completion.</p>\n\r\nControls\u00a0:\r\n<p>Movement: WASD</p>\n<p>Attack Combo: Left Click</p>\n<p>Slow Time: Right Click</p>\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n<p>No SFX or Music</p>\n<p>Sometimes enemies hit twice</p>\n<p>Enemies can push the player up walls.
