We took inspiration from our week long addiction to Factorio. We hope you enjoy our game as much as we enjoyed making it!</p>\n<p>Thank you for giving us a chance,</p>\n<p>CornerSeatStudios.</p><p><strong>Known Issues</strong><br/></p><p>The walls have no colliders, please don't walk off the edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\t\t-Your objective is to keep the money flowing, we have a starting reserve but will drain over time. The longer you work, the faster the money will drain.\u00a0It is up to you to keep the factory running and earn enough to stop us from going under!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\t\t-Our factory has three machines, a drill, a furnace, and a steel press. The drill produces ore for the furnace, the furnace produces steel plates for the steel press, and the steel press produces die that are sold for profit! Ores and steel plates are stored in storage units between the various machines\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\t\t-We have four dynamic interchangeable core energy cells (or D.I.C.E. cells for short) that power the machines. The higher the number the faster the machines work, but the faster they overheat! The D.I.C.E cells are unstable and reroll every now and then, so be sure to move them around to maintain efficiency. D.I.C.E cells can also be rerolled for a price in the reroll station, so use it cautiously!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n-Good luck out there miner, and remember, keep the money flowing but don\u2019t overheat the machines!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Move Player</p>\n<p>Left click - Interact with dice, factories, and reroll shop</p>\n<p>Esc - Pause game</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<p>Nathan Yuen</p>\n<p>Kevin Gao</p>\n<p>Kevin Xiao</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Neonscapes by | e s c p | https://escp-music.bandcamp.com</strong></strong></p><strong><strong>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\u00a0and\u00a0https://pixabay.com/</p>\n<p>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)</p></strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:45:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86c/86c00227493b87be58cda4a838a259ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["CornerSeatStudios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
