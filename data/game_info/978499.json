{"id": 978499, "slug": "slidemagi", "name": "Slidemagi", "name_original": "Slidemagi", "description": "<strong>Slidemagi</strong> is a turn-based strategy game in which units move by sliding the lines of the board. You are a Mage who, using your deck of cards, can summon spells or create units with unique abilities to fight under your control. <br/><br/>The game has two main modes of play: adventure mode where you progress to unlock new spells and units, and player vs. player magical combat where each Mage uses their deck to defeat the opponent. <br/><h3>Features: </h3><br/><ul><li>Sliding: Units move by sliding the lines. When the move is made, all your units will execute their action. The position of units is important.<br/><br/><br/></li><li>Squeezing: By sliding, other units can become squeezed into their line, allowing dangerous terrain to be placed beneath them.<br/><br/><br/></li><li>Mages and Spells: You are the Mage! You must defeat the enemy in a magical combat. Use your deck of cards to cast powerful spells and summon new units.<br/><br/><br/></li><li>Graves and Raise Dead: When a unit dies, a grave appears, which the Necromancer can revive. As all objects lock the line on the edge when sliding, this is a fundamental part of the game, leading to open or closed games.<br/><br/><br/></li><li>Chain Reactions: Certain moves can cause chain reactions. For example, killing enemies and having a Necromancer to revive them in the same turn.<br/><br/><br/></li><li>Deck Building: Before going into the battle, choose a set of spells from the available spell cards. Deck composition will depend on your strategy and the characteristics of the terrain you'll be playing on. The deck is shuffled, and you will have five spells available at any given time. Chance also plays a role.<br/><br/><br/></li><li>Spell Cards and Units: There are dozens of unit types and spells to use and combine to craft your strategy. Each type of unit performs a specific action. For example, Spiders shoot a web that traps the enemy and makes them very vulnerable; Scorpions, poison their enemies, etc. There are melee and ranged units, weak and powerful units, grounded and flying units, etc.<br/><br/><br/></li><li>Many Modes of Play: Dive into adventure mode to discover and master new spells, or enjoy friendly competition in both local and online multiplayer magical duels.</li></ul><br/><strong>Slidemagi is a game with an original design, developed by BATOVI Games, a studio from Montevideo, Uruguay.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-15T08:39:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fba710b595ab5c25158d08c11e565841.jpg", "website": "http://www.slidemagi.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BATOVI Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BATOVI Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
