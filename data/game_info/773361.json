It's like that, but with a ton of players. Like a Pong Battle Royale.</p>\n<p>This is the first Alpha, so there's no multiplayer yet, and the game is kind of jank. Especially the camera, which is pretty zoomed out in the early levels. Fullscreen recommended.</p>\n<p>The stripes are intentional btw, but don't come out great due to the limitations of Unity WebGL.</p>\n<p><strong>Protip: Your paddle is always the one at the bottom center of the screen.</strong></p>\n<p>The way the game works is like pong - there are balls, and you have to hit them back at your opponents. But it's also like Battle\u00a0Royale - if you fail, it's game over. The only way to win is to beat everyone else.</p><p>The balls flying towards you are highlighted red, to help you track what's important.</p><p>The red circle in the middle is a speed zone, the balls speed will increase when they pass through it.</p><p>The balls also move at double speed when they're outside a player's box.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>Your paddle will follow your cursor left and right<br/>R to restart<br/>Any key to continue, when prompted</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T13:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cf/1cf65b081cfafdd29ed1d6a5eaf633ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["guitar-kid"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
