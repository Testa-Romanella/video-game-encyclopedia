The theme we chosen is <em>Every\u00a0<strong>error</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>Are you ready to play music with a partner? Be in sync with each other in this two-player rhythm game! But beware of \"mistakes\", these will confuse your partner or both of you if you make one. Acceleration of the music, dancing notes, visual effects, and many others will make your task more difficult.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>How to play :</em></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>After putting in your name, each player will be assigned a left/right section of the screen. Player 1 will play the <strong>QWER</strong> keyboard keys and Player 2 <strong>789+</strong>. Press the corresponding keys as soon as the notes reach their respective targets.</p>\n<p>When a player misses a note, an \"error\" is triggered, affecting the other player. The effect is to be expected according to the error wheel at the bottom of your screens.</p>\n<p>This game is designed to be played by two players, but there is nothing to stop you from trying to play alone with both hands, like a pianist.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Errors list : <br/></strong></em></p>\n<p>Follow this files for more information about the \"errors\" you might encounter</p>\n<p>https://ibb.co/87dc8pb<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Credits :<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>Programming : Chaomans#2214 and orpher#8493<br/></p>\n<p>Graphics : xchrow#9644<br/></p>\n<p>Sound Design / Menu Music : MiamLesChocapics#6278</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Assets : <br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>Gameplay Music : Lightspeed6 - <em>Groove</em><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Thanks for playing our game &lt;(^-^)&gt; !!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T06:31:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cb/9cb66bc77574018065cc2feaf88eafad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jules Feydy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
