Those that are hunted are just regular people. These are the men and women that fight against the hunters as best they can. Those that hunt are super-human. These are the men and women that show no emotion, murder without reason, able to summon grotesque monsters, not to mention being physically stronger than regular humans by far. The one disadvantage they have is that curse that they bear only allows them to live 18 to 19 years. </p><p>Rento is a 14-year old hunter that a group of people manage to capture. With an experimental procedure, they used a \"seal ring\" to erase the memories of his past, and possibly make him closer to human. Shortly after, Rento joined the group, and even made a few friends, despite the apparent fear they had of him. Together, they represent the best hope this world has.</p><p>Another Day is developed by Qu\u1ed1c Ch\u00ed and is published by RPGVideo and will be priced at $2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d52ea359fd3ca6fb1e41dc322a5cdff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RPGVideo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
