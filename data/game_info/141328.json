This game was created from an unsolved mathematical NP problem called \"Pancake sorting\". But this is maths that anyone can play!</p><p>All you have to do is sort the pancakes into order, smallest at the top, largest at the bottom. Do this by flipping the stack at different points, this is done by clicking on a pancake, this will flip that pancake and all the ones above it.</p><p>So if you think you can complete all 200 levels then come on and have a go.</p><p>Ross Bugden Youtube Channel Link:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQKGLOK2FqmVgVwYf...<br/></p><p>This guy makes awesome music so go subscribe!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf0880e77dbf97896411ecf71927ee8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NewHousegames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
