Once Reached 20, the extractors get damage ressistance and cannot be stealed anymore.</p>\n<p>In this game, you activate and defend the extractors and jump to another level if the one you are on is getting too dangerous. Upon a jump, the next level, character, and energy extraction times will be selected on a dice roll and you will lose 20 energy and/or HP. Any remaining energy will be swapped into HP for the next level.</p>\n<p>Every time you make a jump, new enemies will appear.. even though we didn't have the time to make them really scary... next time, maybe.</p>\n<p>All Art used in the game was licensed out of the team.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T05:13:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a7b57231d7758ed83f4fe92b92e3212.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xeyos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
