But the goal was moreso to help me learn my way around the godot engine. I moved over from gamemaker because I wanted to make a non 2D pixel art games, and 3D games. I could've picked Unity for that I guess. But, based on some youtube research, godot sounded like it was a faster engine to learn and once you did, you could make games faster as well.</p>\n<p>I'm planning on making a \"post mortem\" and releasing the games source code within the next week\u00a0for educational reasons. I can't promise that the code is efficient or neat. But it is thoroughly commented on so it should be easy to comprehend.\u00a0 So it should be beneficial!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T07:33:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4f/d4fd66c504236719dfb811ef71402516.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jelani Stowers"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
