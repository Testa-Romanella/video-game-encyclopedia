I think there\u2019s even some wildlife. I should return it to the company, but if you\u2019re just looking to get away for a bit, I can give you a good discount. That would save me the effort of sending it in. Obviously, there are no guarantees as I haven\u2019t tested it myself.</em></p>\n<p><em>So, you\u2019d be on your own with it.
