For all ages, and it is FREE! <br/><br/>Unlike many other brain training apps, this app is founded on solid scientific ground. <br/><br/>Did you know that the brain can be strengthened just like a muscle? Muscles become stronger with use, and using the brain makes it stronger too. <br/><br/>\u2018Brain Trainer\u2019 is based on famous \u201cStroop effect\u201d named after J. Ridley Stroop who discovered the strange phenomenon in the 1930s. He found that when the name of a color (e.g., \"blue,\" \"green,\" or \"red\") is printed in a color not denoted by the name (e.g., the word \"red\" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The interference between the different information (what the words say and the color of the words) your brain receives causes a problem. That information comes simultaneously from different brain areas / brain hemispheres. It was later found that the task of selecting an appropriate response actively involves anterior cingulate cortex. <br/><br/>The app has a mini-game that helps stimulate and develop anterior cingulate cortex that is responsible for working memory, error detection, conflict monitoring, motivation, attention, modulation of emotional responses and many other cognitive functions. <br/><br/>Features: <br/>- easy control<br/>- excellent music, sound effects and graphics<br/>- detailed instructions <br/>- current score / high score / medal awarding system<br/>- performance report (average response time, number of correct/incorrect answers, success rate, medal, etc.) <br/>- sound / music control <br/><br/>Practice daily, try to get higher scores, help your brain to be in good shape!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T16:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f7/7f735148741a430b99e27378287a4c2e.jpg", "website": "http://vintagames.weebly.com/brain-trainer-plus.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Vinta Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Anton Vinokurov"], "esrb_rating": null}
