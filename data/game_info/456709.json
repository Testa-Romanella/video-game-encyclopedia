There is no text, only audio.</p>\n<p>StoneAge Fishing Experience takes you back to the stoneage around Erteb\u00f8lle where a famous kitchen midden lies. Your task is to catch enough fish to satisfy your tribe or they might go hungry to bed. You have an elder of the tribe with you in the boat to oversee your journey but are otherwise largely on your own to figure things out.</p>\n<p>There is no tutorial implemented but you control by physically looking around with the phone, and you interact/row the boat in the direction you are looking by pressing anywhere on the screen, or pressing on the button if you have a google cardboard device (typically one in plastic has a single button on top.)</p>\n<p>The game was made as part of our Medialogy degree. One group from 2nd semester on the Master, and one group from the final semester on the Master.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Johan Winther Kristensen<br/>Rebecca Vinther<br/>Lasse Loderg Aafeldt<br/>Thomas Noes Mikkelsen<br/>Jakob Elkj\u00e6r Husted<br/>Kate\u0159ina Kourkov\u00e1<br/>Ronny Vangsted</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T06:43:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ee/5ee0fdff44881283dc178afa9c7c77c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["ThaseonGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
