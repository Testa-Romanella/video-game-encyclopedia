Thanks for taking a look at my submission for the Ludum Dare 38 game jam, my first ever jam I've taken place in!</p><p>The theme for this jam is \"A Small World\" and so I decided to make my game one where you have to fend off drills from destroying your little world, a task which gets harder over each of the 14 levels. This game will take a total of 9:20 if you manage to complete it (which I highly doubt as it does get very difficult).</p><p>I wont say this is a good game, I wouldn't even say that this game is good for a 3-day jam, but I hope that it's acceptable. Thank you for playing my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1d/c1d0de259dede024102355765b082a36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob the Seagull King"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
