In the game, the player must navigate a mail-delivery ship between two planets in order to deliver love letters, and is rewarded for collecting additional \"romantic\"\u00a0gifts along the way. The game comes with a simple high-score feature, and you are encouraged to screenshot your high-scores and tweet them at the games creator, on Twitter as @joebaxterwebb.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D = move.</p>\n<p>Shift = use speed boost.</p>\n<p>F11 = switch windowed/fullscreen.</p>\n<p>Space = restart game.</p>\n<p>Esc = quit game.</p>\n\n<p>Developed in GameMaker\u00a0Studio 2 by Dr. Joe Baxter-Webb.
