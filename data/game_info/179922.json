This is partially shown as the later levels become manic. Unfortunately it isn't fully shown as the enemies had to be left as placeholder cubes due to setbacks.</p>\n<p>My goal for this Ludum Dare was to gain more experience\u00a0and a better understanding\u00a0of using Unreal Engine 4 however due to some major bugs in my blueprint, I\u00a0was forced to start again around 24 hours in using\u00a0 Unity. Once I had started again, I changed my personal goal to learn more about spawning objects and enemies in C#. This became the one of the central mechanics that I implemented.</p>\n<p>@CharlieKinglake<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f2/1f29f4f83b1f8812b54feacc96482a84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CKinglake"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
