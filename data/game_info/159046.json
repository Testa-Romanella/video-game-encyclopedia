I don't think i need to explain this further but i will. In antidote you run around a forest and collect shrooms so you could get high. Keep your \"highness\" up in the given time to win! The game features random generation of almost everything so your gameplay experiance would be diferent every time<br/>The controls are like in any other game \"WASD\" to walk and \"Mouse\" to look. You can play this game on a controller but you probably won't be able to access so of the games features.</p><p>Dark Knight Games</p><p>Twitter: @UnrealDarkGames<br/>Facebook: facebook.com/UnrealDarkGames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/448/448dd5e8c97847066eec71a436a87871.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game_Watch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
