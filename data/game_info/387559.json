It's my first attempt at a Visual Novel. I had decided to upload whatever I had on Halloween because it's a good day to release a spooky-themed game. Although there's not much to see at the moment, I have big plans for the story and script in the future all lined up and ready to go! A majority of the month has been used to learn RenPy and how to code the script and all that technical stuff. Anyways, please try it out and leave me a comment about the art style and dialogue. I'm not that good at planning out dialogue and characters so feedback is appreciated! Thanks!</p>\r\nPatreon\r\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/teo3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd6976d429372d2cfacc1e49f7bf6617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Teo3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
