Justin has brought you on as a moderator because their stream has become a viral hit, and as a result, their chat has become infested with spammers, opportunities and people not following the rules. You will be needed to keep the chat under some semblance of control using your moderator actions and permissions.</p>\n<p>The better the chat has been moderated, the more viewers that will watch the stream, making the streamer happy, but the more people watching the stream also means the more bad behaviour occurs. Can you keep the chat in control?</p>\n<p>Mod, Pls\u00a0<br/>Game Credits</p>\n<p>Programming<br/>Chris Craig<br/>Paul Garner</p>\n<p>Design<br/>Rhys Price</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Lee, Nick, Adam and Jack for use of emotes.</p>\n<p>Music<br/>Hall of the Mountain King by Kevin MacLeod | http://incompetech.com<br/>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com<br/>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:25:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43c/43c53365efb1b1543fa221bb4de93f45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Azilorn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
