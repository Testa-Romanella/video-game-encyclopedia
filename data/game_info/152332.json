Our task was to create a 3D platformer with Unity. In chasm you play a discoverer who climbed down into an old tomb to recover a treasure. The goal of the game is to jump back up as long as you can to escape the chasm and to collect diamonds on your way up. The textures and the music and sounds were not created by me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/bab4f25fe72728765c536b40d5cb294d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["doingitraith"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
