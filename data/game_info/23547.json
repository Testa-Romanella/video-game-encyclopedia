Jaipur is a fast-paced card game for two players with a blend of tactics, risk and luck. You are one of the most powerful traders in Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan. You and your opponent duel to demonstrate to the Maharajah that you can earn a greater profit than your competition. At the end of a round, one player receives the Maharajah's seal of excellence, and the first player to earn two seals of excellence wins the privilege of being invited to the Maharajah\u2019s court! <br/><br/>Each turn, you can choose to take one card, exchange your cards for other goods, buy the camels needed to transport your wares, or sell at the market. The sooner you sell and the more you sell of a single good at once, the higher your profit. <br/><br/>If you take cards, you have to choose between taking all the camels, taking 1 card from the market or swapping 2 to 5 cards between the market and your cards. If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good per turn, and you get as many chips from that good as you sold cards. The chips\u2019 values decrease as the game progresses, but you get increasingly high rewards for selling sets of 3, 4, or 5 cards of the same good at a time, so it\u2019s all about waiting just the right amount of time to make your trade.<br/><br/>You can\u2019t sell camels, but they are integral to trading and they\u2019re also worth a little something at the end of the round, sometimes enough to secure the win so use them smartly!<br/><br/>In this digital adaptation of the award-winning card game, find a comprehensive interactive tutorial and an extensive campaign mode.
