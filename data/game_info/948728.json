Thank you Stable Diffusion.</p>\n\n<p>In this game, you are a card instead of the card player.</p>\n<p>That means, you can only watch the silly plays of your partner and waiting for their decisions\u00a0of sending you on the pitch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite of fight hard and keep getting stronger, you also MUST work for the oppotunity of getting on the duel venue!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The way to get into the fight is hard and dishonorable:\u00a0to\u00a0make your partner like your characteristcs - the element type, race and outfit of the card. The card duelers will only first send up the card they like, instead of the stronger card.</p>\n\n<p>There were many machanics\u00a0I didn't finish the in-game-display.... Therefore the game may look messy and a little confusing.</p>\n<p>The rogue-lite part was cut off.</p>\n<p>Bugs were not well tested and fixed.</p>\n<p>That's because I delayed almost everything to the last hours LOL.
