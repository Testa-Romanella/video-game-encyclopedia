{"id": 498857, "slug": "vacuum-collector", "name": "Vacuum collector", "name_original": "Vacuum collector", "description": "<p>This game is made for / inspired by VimJam.</p>\n<p>The theme of the Jam was 'There and Back', so I thought of how a vacuum cleaner moves 'there and back' repeatedly. There also had to be something you could collect, but that is easy for a vacuum cleaner, because it sucks up dust and crumbs and coins and lost socks behind the couch.<br/></p>\n<p>So a fun idea was forming in my head. You are a vacuum cleaner and you have to suck up all the trash from the floor. You also have to make special moves to get under the couch, for example. <br/></p>\n<p>But you can't get to the whole house, because you are connected to the power outlet. So once your bag is full, you have to empty it for experience, that experience will make your cord longer, so you can get to the more valuable trash.</p>\n<p>There are different categories of trash and per category there are normal and rare and ultra rare versions. For example a red , a silver and a gold coin.</p>\n<p>I haven't thought of a cool ending yet, right now this is my idea:<br/></p>\n<p>Once you have collected everything there is, you finished the game. The high score can be the time it cost you, so you can try and beat other players.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T05:20:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/aff62ef54159e2524dfd3cd2c11fbbfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tixieej"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
