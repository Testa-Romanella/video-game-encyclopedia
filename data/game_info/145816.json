{"id": 145816, "slug": "lil-rascals", "name": "Lil Rascals", "name_original": "Lil Rascals", "description": "<p>Lil Rascals is a moody, town-based game revolving around a kid\u2019s imagination through a collectible seeking game. The basis of the game involves all 3 players selecting a role of their choice, whether to be part of a team (choosing red or blue) or alone (choosing gold). Whoever plays alone has to gather more collectibles (10) considering they\u2019re viewed as the one against all. The other players each collect 3 of their own for a grand total of 6.</p>\n<p>All players, although they can\u2019t collect collectibles that aren\u2019t their own colors, they have the option to push the others\u2019 collectibles into hiding, making it more difficult for the other team to collect to victory, buying the player more time.</p>\n<p>*This game is played with gamepads only! PS4 controllers work best*</p>\n<p>This game was made for a short group project in class. 4 people in a group: Tiffany, Conor, Dennis, Kimberly.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the game also has no 'exit' function as of yet considering it was finalized during a Game Jam, but will be added in the future. In order to quit, you must force quit the game. Super sorry about that!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f2/2f2984fe94651aa32b3896431005aed1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Kimberly Pena"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
