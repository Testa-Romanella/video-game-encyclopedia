It makes use of intertwining stories with multiple paths. There is a festival happening in town, and your Uncle has just gotten back home from it. But, he has forgotten to bring his hat home with him! Explore Haravgi and uncover the lives of the various residents as you make your way around the festival. They might not be as happy as they initially seem, but there is always a silver lining in every cloud.</p>\n<p>Made in Unity with the Pixel Crushers Dialogue System, Haravgi demonstrates the capabilities of the system to script sequences and create interesting video game experiences. By using filmmaking techniques such as mise en scene and dynamic camera angles, Haravgi frames each conversation and character uniquely. The seemingly demonic\u00a0Hyro is shrouded in darkness, while the extroverted Aya stays near the bonfire. The conversations that the player has with the characters develops their psychological and social dimensions, creating a fun story. The level design leads the player towards their goals with props, lighting, and fields of view.</p>\n<p>Design by Joseph Poselenzny.\u00a0VIEW PORTFOLIO</p>\n<strong>Asset Credits <em>(Click to View)</em></strong>\n<p><strong>DIALOG</strong></p><p>Dialogue System: Pixel Crushers,\u00a0https://www.pixelcrushers.com/dialogue-system/</p><p><strong>ART</strong></p><p>Acoustic Guitar: NOT_Lonely,\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/acoustic-guitar-21037</p><p>Characters and Animations: Mixamo,\u00a0https://www.mixamo.com/#/</p><p>Free Hats for UMA: Sliced Studio,\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/free-hats-for-uma-33503</p><p>Medieval Tent Big: kawetofe,\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/medieval-tent-big...</p><p>Modular Medieval Lanterns: Alexandr Voevodov,\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/modular-medieval-...</p><p>Sun Temple: Sandro T,\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sun-temple-115417#descript...</p><p><strong>AUDIO</strong></p><p>Ambience Food Court B: InspectorJ,\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/421715/</p><p>Cicadas and crickets at night near a river in Emei Shan (China): EduFigueres,\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/EduFigueres/sounds/454661/</p><p>Doorbell Notification: TheBuilder15,\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/TheBuilder15/sounds/415763/</p><p>Fire Crackles: florianreichelt,\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/florianreichelt/sounds/563766/</p><p>Q Key: UberBosser,\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/UberBosser/sounds/421583/</p><p>Rattle: gusgus26,\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/gusgus26/sounds/216057/</p><p>Remix #3 of 90196_cunningGnome_01_Rhthm.flac: Timbre/cunningGnome,\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Timbre/sounds/116153/</p><p>Short Click/Snap Perc, waveplaySFX,\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/waveplaySFX/sounds/399934/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T22:45:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/436/436af1c8338f13202ac09fb6c46f6ae5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["fatjosephina"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
