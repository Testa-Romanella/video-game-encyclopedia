Instead it is this.</p>\n<p>You're a little ghost with a laser gun. You can move through walls. Grab as many coins as you can without being caught by the corporeal guards, who cannot move through walls. There's also ammo and sometimes health pickups.</p>\n<p>Controls are just the arrows. You can't move in a direction if there is a target there you can shoot. Don't get stuck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/196295d741e7e30b0f2ac4cc4c87396b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
