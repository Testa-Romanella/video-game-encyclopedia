Be patient!!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>One Button Bosses is what the names tell you it is. It's a boss that you fight with one button.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a test build where we are trying to gather data about how people play the game. It turns out that making alternative movement abilities is hard and we are looking for feedback on how they feel and which ones you all prefer.\r\n</p>\n<p>The goal for this game is to make a 45ish minute experience where you fight different bosses unlocking different movement/attacking abilities for your ship.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hope you all enjoy it!\r\n<br/><br/>PS: The newgroundsversion has high-score support ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T07:41:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ca/0ca22ad8e5f02107a85a283800f2d23d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brin"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
