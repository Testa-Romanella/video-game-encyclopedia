Bored one night, she turns on the TV only to see a broadcast announcing an evacuation for her neighborhood. Locked inside, she must solve puzzles in order to find the key and escape her house.</p>\n<p>Room Escape was inspired by a challenge on the RPGMakerweb forum: create a game that has only one map, 10 events, 10 switches, and 10 variables. The original version hewed to these limitations quite closely, but the special edition has been expanded on a bit, including an extra ending and a quiz minigame. Graphics by White Screw Shop.
