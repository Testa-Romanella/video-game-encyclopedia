It has the ability to absorb energy from animals and humans, but this leads to their petrification. The player encounters a young shaman who is inexplicably immune to this deadly ability. She tries to fathom the mystery of the forest, because the fog is getting closer and closer to her village.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Mistwood, a Bachelor Project form Manuel Arabadzic and Myriel Schigiol</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks to:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Prof. Sebastian Stamm ( Project Consultation)<ul><li>http://www.the-stamm.com/wordpress/</li><li>https://twitter.com/thestamm</li></ul></li><li>Prof. Csongor Baranyai (Game Design Consultation)\r\n<ul><li>http://csongorb.com</li><li>https://twitter.com/csongorb</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Repository Link:\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>https://bitbucket.org/lei_12/mistwood_ba-project/src/master/<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Release Notes:\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>Release Version 1.0</p>\n<p><em>This game was created at the Game Design // UE\u00a0Department of the\u00a0University of Applied Sciences Europe. <br/></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>\n</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<em>\n</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T06:35:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab0a7adb7b7edb1c038d66e159e5ddad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lei-12"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
