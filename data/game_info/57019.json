{"id": 57019, "slug": "eternal-champions", "name": "Eternal Champions (1993)", "name_original": "Eternal Champions (1993)", "description": "<p>Eternal Champions is a 1993 fighting game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. It was one of the few fighting games of its time developed from the ground up as a home console title, rather than being released in arcades first and later ported to home systems.<br />\nSega released Eternal Champions in hopes of capitalizing on the fighting game mania that the game industry was in the midst of following the massive success of Street Fighter II (1991) and Mortal Kombat (1992). The game tried to set itself apart with unique features such as a heavier emphasis on its story, characters pulled from different time periods, reflectable projectiles, force fields, fighters that carried weapons, a training mode where players had to defend themselves against robotic traps, a novel method of executing moves, and elaborate stage-specific finishing moves called &quot;Overkills&quot;.<br />\nTwo years later, the sequel Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side (sometimes known as Eternal Champions CD or Eternal Champions 2) was released for the Sega CD. There were also two spin-offs, action/adventure games set in the Eternal Champions universe and featuring some of its characters. Eternal Champions was added to the Wii&#39;s Virtual Console download service on December 3, 2007.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-09T09:26:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/29a/29af20b53a8b91c48473e36addb46548.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.8, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 8, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 548, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS", "Genesis"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
