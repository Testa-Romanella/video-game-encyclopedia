{"id": 739540, "slug": "the-way-episode-1", "name": "The Way: Episode 1", "name_original": "The Way: Episode 1", "description": "<p>The people of The Way believe that the entire world is enclosed by the Rolling Mists. The very front of the world is gradually revealed by the Mists and explored by the Forerunners, while the rear of the world is swallowed. What lies in between is the titular Way and every human being spends their life Walking the Earth, either alone or accompanied by other wanderers. Settling down is considered blasphemous and the religious order of The Guided will ensure that the people keep moving forward and live their lives the way it is intended by The Purpose.</p>\n<p>The story follows Rhue of Landorin, a young wanderer on a quest to regain a piece of his past. As the game begins, he&#39;s been searching the Way for many years already. Rhue is setting a frantic pace for himself, desperate for a simple clue that might help guide him to that which he lost so many years ago.</p>\n<p>The Way, created over a 4-year period, is an epic tale that spans six episodes and contains a<br />\nminimum of 20 hours of gameplay. It is highly cinematic for a 2D RPG with hundreds of carefully<br />\nscripted cut scenes that progress the story. Don&#39;t expect to see characters standing around just yammering; The Way&#39;s cut scenes emphasize action and make use of a wide range of brilliant<br />\nspecial effects and animations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-15T19:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cb/1cb41e70a50d830b189732f2c9fc5124.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/507/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
