Control it with an interactive dual throttle system and traverse an infinite landscape. Jump off of hills, drift sharp turns, try the loop de loop if you dare. This game uses extreme locomotion and is not recommended for those prone to VR induced motion sickness.<br/><br/><strong>In-vehicle controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Press and hold the Oculus button to center your view.</li><li>Grab the dual throttles with grip buttons and move your hands to control them. Push both throttles forward to accelerate. Pull either throttle backward to turn in that throttle's direction. Pull them both backward to reverse.</li><li>Press and hold either trigger button (or both) to lose traction and engage drifting. Let go to recover traction.</li><li>Press the B or Y button (or both) to align your ship with the terrain. This is necessary for things like wall riding and loops.\u00a0<strong>Warning:</strong> this is also considerably\u00a0more\u00a0intense in terms of motion\u00a0sickness. </li></ul>\n<p>This project is currently in the early alpha/prototype stage. There is no tutorial or menu at the moment, and you will be dropped immediately into the cockpit.<br/></p>\n<p>Hover Quest Discord: https://discord.gg/fNeykyQ<br/>Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jasonofthestorm<br/>Use SideQuest to install this and more on your Oculus Quest: https://sidequestvr.com/<br/><br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T09:32:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc3a253ca001dae5aceb8eaaaed60162.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["jasonofthestorm"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
