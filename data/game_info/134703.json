This version has the tag \"FIXED\" in the dowloads.\u00a0The first version is still available. You should play the fixed version but take the fixes into account when rating (even if I don't really care about the ratings and just want some feedback).</p>\n<p>Here are the fixes:</p>\n<p>- The exclamation mark now appears correctly in the first cutscene</p>\n<p>- A dialog that kept showing now hides correctly</p>\n<p>- Fixed an enemy hitbox</p>\n<p>- I deactivated\u00a0the debug mode</p>\n<p>- Fixed a camera bug</p>\n<p>- Didn't only fixed the endings but improved them</p>\n<p>Known remaining bugs:</p>\n<p>- The teleportation doesn't check if the resulting position has a collision hitbox, potentially stucking you in a wall</p>\n<p>- When the possession of an enemy stops, it can result in hitbox collision bug, stucking you in a wall</p>\n<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>\n<p>Made in August 2018 for the LOWREZJAM 2018.</p>\n<p>It was my fourth game jam.</p>\n<p>There was no theme apart from the restriction of a 64x64 resolution.</p><p>For this game, I wanted to try some things I hadn't really tried yet. I spent some time\u00a0making cutscenes and dialogs. I focused more on music and sound too. I think my gameplay with the ghost had potential, but in the end the game is mainly cutscenes.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>\n<p>Gamemaker Studio: 2, Aseprite,\u00a0Bosca Ceoil,\u00a0Bfxr, Beesbusy.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Font m3x6 by\u00a0Daniel Linssen.</p>\n<p>Sound \"Bird Whistling, Single, Robin, A.wav\" by InspectorJ</p>\n<p>Sound \"fire2.wav\" by tc630</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\r\n\r\nKeyboardGamepad\r\nMoveArrowsWASD<br/>ZQSD<br/>Arrows\r\nSkill 1RTJ\r\nSkill 2RBK\r\nValidateButton 1Enter\r\nSkip cutsceneSelectEscape\r\nUpscaleLT+\r\nDownscaleLB-\r\n\r\n<p>After the introduction and a fight, you will play a ghost with the ability of possessing enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips (spoiler)</strong></p>\n<p>There are four different endings:</p>\n<p>- \"Victory\" - You discovered the name of the creature that killed you.
