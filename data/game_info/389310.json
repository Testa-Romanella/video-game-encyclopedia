Making the idea of recycling fun emphasises how we can each do our bit for the environment and be accountable for our actions.</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p>You start by sorting trash from a conveyor belt into their respective bins (mixed recycling, food waste, and general waste). For each piece of rubbish that is incorrectly sorted it adds to a landfill in the background of the level. Meanwhile you are sorting the rubbish, the ocean is slowly being filled with rubbish too. Players must manage both the trash conveyor belt and scooping trash from the ocean in order to keep pollution levels both on the land and on the sea to a minimum. Once the trash collected and the bins reach full capacity, players are able to click on them resulting in the \"Food Waste\" and \"Recycling\" being recycled and the \"General Waste\", as it is unsustainable, gets thrown off into the sea and adds to the growing pollutants found there that players must in turn scoop up. The player receives a score for the waste they correctly sort, and the game ends when either the landfill is full or the sea has reached maximum pollution levels.</p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n<p>Made by...</p>\n<p>Me (@justdryan) - Lead Programmer/General Cool Guy</p>\n<p>Piers (@hello_piers) - Lead Art &amp; Sound Designer/Another Cool Guy</p>\n<p>Belle (@bellehathnofury) - Lead Designer/Producer/Social Media Manager/Coolest Girl on the Team</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:06:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dd/8dd25ac8eddcefcb713380d83cf43b83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan Ryan", "Piers Reed", "anecdoshe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
