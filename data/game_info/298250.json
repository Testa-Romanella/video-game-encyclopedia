You must expand the map by building color coded tiles, each with a different role and support purpose. While you armor your tank and swiftly maneuver through the sea of enemies. But build wisely, as the enemies troops are dumb, but the enemy hives are not.</p>\n<p>(This game is still a work in progress)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:53:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc5fe3943781df6dd7492d8106ef126b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ruben Van der Merwe"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
