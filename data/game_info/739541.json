The game was later released as freeware in 1997. It represents an early example of a game that allowed players to edit using object-oriented programming. Players control a smiley face to battle various creatures and solve puzzles in different grid-based boards in a chosen world. It includes an in-game editor, allowing players to develop their own worlds while using the game&#39;s scripting language, ZZT-OOP.</p>\n<p>The game was followed by a sequel, Super ZZT (1992). Other ZZT worlds were published later that same year as Best of ZZT and ZZT&#39;s Revenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:46:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905e6157235a8dadb1b89a518401ac83.jpg", "website": "https://museumofzzt.com/zzt/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
