Really haven't been able to get the scaling and touch controls to line up in a way that feels fun. I'd like to have a spin or drag gesture to rotate.</li><li>BETTER COLORS:<br/>Working through a book on colour theory and the evolution of colour sight in my reading time. The current colours are based around a friend who is Red/Green colourblind (<em>why I bought the book</em>).</li><li>TRANSITION UPGRADE:<br/>When tiles add there needs to be a better slide or combination animation. Something that is more satisfying than the current under/over and ping noise.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T08:53:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be3/be383c62e3bbac7ca47755f29d8f2f03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boxhead"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
