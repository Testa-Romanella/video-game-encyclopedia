Players sitting opposite each other play as a team. The game begins with a round of bidding. You try to predict the number of \"tricks\", or turns, you will win. The combined bids of two partners make a \"contract\". Once the bidding is completed, the partners must fulfill their contract, not the individual bids. You make a contract by winning at least a contracted number of tricks. A bid of Nil means the player will try not to win any tricks. The \"trump\" (or highest value) suit is always Spades. Each contracted trick is worth 10 points. If you fail to fulfill the contract, a penalty is the entire value of that contract. Each overtrick, or taking more than you bid, is worth 1 point and also earns you one \"bag\". Every set of 10 \"bags\" incurs a 100-point penalty. Winning a Nil bid is worth 100 points, failing a Nil bid is penalized by 100 points.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T03:24:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d560a901b3f12fe17e996abd3dbec805_ajPvaln.jpg", "website": "http://www.1cmobile.com/games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["1C Mobile"], "genres": ["Casual", "Card"], "publishers": ["1C Mobile"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
