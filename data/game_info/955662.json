Taking influence from modern and classic titles while adding twists of humor and bizarre situations, Spurdo :D makes for a game that has a personality all of it's own.<br/><br/><h3>Story</h3>Spurdo, a character with a noticeable speech impediment, has found himself in the afterlife.  Waiting to be judged, he finds that he has no memories to be judged by.  This sets him on an adventure to where he must re-experience a multitude of his other previous lives, spanning across different realities, in order so that he may finally be judged, but along the way he encounters certain oddities that have him questioning everything that's going on.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>Spurdo :D is a single player action adventure game that focuses on humorous interactions and setting up interesting and varied worlds to experience.  Each of these worlds has it's own unique gameplay elements to them, ranging from collecting attack moves in order to fight your opponents within an old school turn based battle system, to simply going around and talking to characters so you can make friends with them, as to not experience the end of the world alone.  In essence, each of the worlds you visit, acts as it's own separate game, yet tied to the overarching story.  Most of your time spent in these memories specifically revolve around your last moments in those worlds, leading up to your inevitable death in them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Spurdo :D features a variety of freedoms to the player, such as:<br/><br/>-Quick save states, allowing the player to save at nearly any point, and load up at that point.<br/>-Freedom to decide the fate of the other characters in the worlds by letting them live or not.<br/>-Explore the world, or rush to the end.  It's up to you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T07:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c20/c20785807785b1ea793bc38400433e9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason PK Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jason PK Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
