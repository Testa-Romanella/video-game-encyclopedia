Try to find the other players in surprising environments to get the best score. Lie down under beds or crouch behind crates and try to secure the best hiding spot!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach player will in turn become the cat. The mice will have a short time to find the best hiding place in various environments. When released, the cat will gain points by finding as many players as possible. The anxious mice will tremble as they can keep track of the cat's position by listening to the changes of the spatialized music. A vocal chat adds tons of fun and a great social dimension to the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22a/22a3f81e8d42b259504e97cfb37e7d8a.jpg", "website": "http://infiniverse.fr/en/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GaelDK", "Serge Sentis", "Fabien Spiess", "Antoine Rigitano"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Infiniverse"], "esrb_rating": null}
