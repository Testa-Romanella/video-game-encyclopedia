But you are not able to shoot in a classic way. Your only weapon is a gravity gun, which can affect enemy bullets. They can be absorbed and thrown back at hostile space ships. Also, asteroids can be altered and used as deadly weapons. If you unlock enough upgrades, enemy ships can even be thrown against each other or planets. Are you ready to fight?</p>\n<p><em>created by Tobias Cutik and Leon Geier</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:19:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e02/e02050f39e72b2e615ffe3409f829aeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tobias Cutik"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
