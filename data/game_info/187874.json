You play as commander of the Corgi army and you have to try to stop the invasion of the Raccoons from the moon. <strong>Defeat waves of enemies and beat the final boss.</strong> You can not fail or your best friend, mankind, will be doomed!</p><p>A successor with the name \"Moon Raccoon 2\" is already planned.</p>NOTE: The current Windows version may not work for some.
