Try not to be late... or hit any buildings along the way.</p>\n<p><em>(If you do hit a few odd buildings, doing a little hop over a traffic cone can sometimes assuage your passenger's temper.)</em></p>\n<p>Once you safely deliver them to their destination,\u00a0 they will pay you in FISH based on how happy they are with your service. <strong>A\u00a0</strong><strong>3 FISH TIP\u00a0is a perfect score!</strong> 8 FISH total will win you the game.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong> Use the MOUSE and SPACEBAR to control your vehicle. LMB will accelerate, RMB will slow down for a moment, and SPACEBAR will make you do a little hop!</p>\n<p><strong>ALSO:</strong> R will Reset the game, F will toggle Fullscreen mode, and ESC will end the program. <em>(X does something too.)</em></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Made for Mini Jam 80: Cats!</strong> <em>(Limitation: 8x8 textures.</em><em>\u00a0All textures are 8x8, and the car/cat object is composed of an 8x8 sprite's\u00a08-frames, spread across a fake \"z\" axis instead of time.)</em></p>\n<p>All visual assets were made by me, with Music generated with Wolfram Tones and SFX created with BFXR.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong> I thought I had the collisions worked out, but there are still some random clipping issues with some of the buildings. Press \"R\" to reset if you ever\u00a0 get stuck.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Cheers, everyone!</strong> Enjoy, post your best time, and let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T10:42:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47e/47effeda6d48e675de180ac1310dd3ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KingRegicon"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
