I don't know how to fix that. I did some research and apparently many executable files made with pyinstaller (that's what I used) are considered as virus by Windows. So I would like to say that there is no risk downloading my game, however, if you feel there might be any risk, I won't mind if you don't download! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T08:09:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aad79f7c2a189972c91d65bf7b1b219.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Makto Maktavish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
