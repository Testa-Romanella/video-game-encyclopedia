There are several hazards along the well that instantly kill the player, the player can also fall off the platforms. If the player is killed or they fall off a platform they will respawn at the nearest checkpoint that they have passed.</p>\n<p>There are various environment objects that the player interacts with such as launchpads, pushable objects, and a gun that is able to destroy hazards.</p>\n<p>The game keeps track of the player's time to complete the level. The fastest time to complete the level is recorded and saved on the menu screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nA, D - Move left/right<br/>Spacebar - Jump<br/>Enter - Shoot (when gun is equipped)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T23:41:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b8fd8da6d6df055f9b8df85b024ef1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dhevan Lau"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
