The game has a few bugs in the web version that we couldn't fix before the jam deadline, these bugs don't exist in the windows version!

We are working on fixing these and will update when the jam ends!\r\n\r\nThe DUSTPOCALYPSE has arrived... as a small and cute cat, you're no match against the mutated dust bunnies. Until\u00a0a Roomba with a gun shows up!\r\n<p>The Roomba shoots any enemies it sees, but to take full advantage of it, you must lure it around by throwing snacks!\u00a0Along the way, you can also collect dust from dead enemies to level up and upgrade your and the Roomba's abilities!</p>\n<p>Survive against waves and waves of endless enemies in this uhh... twin stick shooter?\u00a0 sure lets go with that.
