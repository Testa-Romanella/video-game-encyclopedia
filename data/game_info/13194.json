First, doctors learn from his memory his past to find out why before his death he wants to fulfil such a strange desire - to go to the Moon.<br />\nThen there is a strong story about meetings and partings, about promises and losses. It ends well, but only in the patient&#39;s memories.<br />\nThe gameplay consists of the study of small locations, the solution of simple puzzles and long, saturated dialogues. All this becomes fascinating thanks to the elaborated plot.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2011-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T22:35:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fae/faebf3c8cbf30db3f46bfbecf6ada3d6.jpg", "website": "http://www.freebirdgames.com/to_the_moon/", "rating": 4.29, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 382, "owned": 3958, "beaten": 1150, "toplay": 222, "dropped": 117, "playing": 17}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 1088, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1098, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC", "Android", "Linux", "iOS", "macOS"], "developers": ["Freebird Games", "X.D.
