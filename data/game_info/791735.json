Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version.<h3>Gameplay</h3>Try to survive for as long as possible, dodging the pods of space junk hurled at you, as well as the black hole in the centre of the screen. Your Space-Dozer is equipped with an anti-momentum shovel up front that can push the pods, and a skyhook to stabilise spinning pods on the back. Knock the pods safely into the black hole.
