The orb in the game will be something zombies drop however as of right now you can just walk into it and gain 1000 health. Zombies and the gun are from unity's asset store because I can't make models my main skill is programming which all of that is done by me. Any donations will be put towards getting better assets for the game so if you would like to help with the production of the game please donate, any amount will be much appreciated thank you<br/><br/><strong>*EXTRACT FILE TO PLAY*</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T10:50:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/587/5874ce73d98ac61e4070054e4ab32e1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TiccyTilley"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
