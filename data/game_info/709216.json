What are they doing??? <br/>What if people at work see this??\u00a0Put a stop to these silly #MartaCon shenanigans. <br/>THIS IS EMBARRASSING.</strong></em></p>\n<p>You play as Marta; a mild-mannered graphic designer by day, and FEROCIOUS lover of birbs, baguettes, and tofu by night. This is the totally real\u00a0story of Marta\u00a0and her fans running a charity convention in her honor.</p>\n<p>In a fit of rage, Marta rips her ticket to #MartaCon into 8 pieces: only to find out, she can't stop #MartaCon without going inside (which of course... you need a ticket to get in!) <br/><br/>To make things worse, these hooligans behind #MartaCon have taken her ticket pieces and are guarding them from her!</p>\n<p>Get your ticket pieces back, get inside, and Stop #MartaCon.</p>\n<p>You'll need to play several minigames with a bit of a Marta-twist in order to get all 8 pieces. Good luck!</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDED TO PLAY IN FIREFOX, AS CHROME THROTTLES MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE. It'll still *work* in chrome, but there will be a lot more slowdown.</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p>This is a simple and silly game (average playtime 30minutes-1 hour)\u00a0\u00a0made by <em>someone who's never made a game before</em> to hype up #MartaCon: an <strong>annual</strong>\u00a0livestream fundraiser for SpecialEffect in Marta's name. SpecialEffect are a UK based charity that specializes in making videogames more accessible to everyone. Using your donations, SpecialEffect provide lifelong support for kids and adults with physical disabilities to play videogames! From things as little as modified keycaps, or wheelchair-controller mounts; all the way to creating brand new joysticks that can be controlled with just one hand, a foot, or even a mouth; and so much more!\u00a0</p>\n<p>SpecialEffect gives unique and personalized options so anyone can play videogames. It's one of Marta's favorite charities, and as twitch streamers and content creators, it's no wonder why a charity so dedicated to gaming\u00a0resonates so heavily with us as well. Between last year's #MartaCon and other events run by our team, we've raised over \u00a33,000 for such a great cause.\u00a0 And as of this game's release we raised nearly\u00a0\u00a32000 on top of that through this year's event!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marta has absolutely nothing to do with #MartaCon</strong>, we're just a bunch of loose-cannon fans that want to spread Marta's love of gaming to people who also love games, but don't get the same opportunities to play. We just shamelessly use her name &amp; face for branding because it's honestly really funny and because it's going towards a great charity that she loves, she can't stop us.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Donated funds to this game will go towards: <br/>https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/\u00a0<br/><br/>You can also donate directly to the fundraising page: \u00a0\u00a0https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/martacon</p>\n<p>For updates on all things #MartaCon:<br/>https://twitter.com/SaveMartaCon</p>\n\n<p>The box shows a <strong><em>SUGGESTED DONATION</em></strong>\u00a0of $5, but that is for the soundtrack, the game is fully playable in browser (downloadable executables coming after some further bug squashing.) Again, I have never made a game before, and didn't know the first thing about code when I started.\u00a0This is my first attempt at building a game. This is a joke, purely for fun--no obligation or requirement to donate.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T05:06:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ae/2ae8ff3a4b19159f766eb53716299235.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hard_Pretzel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
