The main campaign is where the heart of the game's narrative lies but you will also be able to experience the universe of\u00a0<strong>STARDROP</strong>\u00a0through its side missions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Exploration lies at the game's core but so does accessibility. While the game offers puzzles and asks the player to figure out what to do or where to go next, the flow of information within the game will always guide you. Objectives are always made clear and designed with logic in mind. However, those who venture off the beaten path will find that there are more than enough secrets to be discovered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Throughout the game the player will be able to interact with various types of interfaces such as control panels, elevators and security system as well as other various interactive objects such as computer interfaces where you can read emails, listen to audio logs and more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your\u00a0<strong>All-Purpose-Design (APD) space suit</strong>\u00a0is equipped with a set of tools that you will need in order to succeed. The suit comes with a built-in flashlight. The object scanner enables you to identify objects of interest that you can interact with. The vision scanner uses echo location technology so that you will be able to see when your ordinary flashlight is not sufficient. Your suit also is capable of zero gravity mobility under certain circumstances.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The\u00a0<strong>DataPad</strong>\u00a0is an essential tool. It enables you to view your current objective, read audio and text logs that you've collected and it also comes with a built-in mini-map.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Our main focus will always be on the game's story but we strife to deliver breathtaking visuals where possible. Our efforts have lead us to win\u00a0<strong>Best 3D Graphics</strong>\u00a0in the\u00a0<strong>Intel Level Up Contest</strong>\u00a0of 2017. We will continue to uphold these standards if not lifting them up even higher.<br/><br/><br/>We will continue to release new chapters through episodic installments until the full story is told. We will also release patches, tweaks and polished content in between these installments. More SRO side missions are planned upon release and post release and we will also keep listening to out community as we always have and we will do our very best to make\u00a0<strong>STARDROP</strong>\u00a0a unique and amazing experience.<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>A strong engaging story breaking from the usual darker Sci-Fi setting.</li><li>Explore multiple spacecraft, Outposts, Stations and more as a salvage &amp; rescue operative.</li><li>Professional voice acting to drive an unusual story full of mysteries and excitement.</li><li>A range of light environmental puzzles and a touch of stealth.</li><li>Exploration mixed with narrative driven gameplay.</li><li>Inspired by story-rich classics such as Portal, Firewatch and even Alien: Isolation.</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<p>We love interacting with our fans and community members, so be sure to\u00a0visit our website\u00a0or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0to keep up to date and to be able to interact with us.

Our goal is not only to create an amazing gaming experience but to build up trust between us and our community and grow the team's reputation in general.\u00a0</em>\n<em>Since we are a very small team we'll be able to gain feedback and bug reports which we ourselves might have missed to make sure that the game will be strong on release with a solid fan base.</em>\n<em>Our plan for continued support is to release new side missions and proper development progress updates and releasing stable builds akin to episodic releases as well as other ways to include community members that we can keep our audience engaged and excited as we work towards the game's full release.</em>\n<em>On top of that we love to engage with the community and want to offer them a chance to voice their opinions, likes and dislikes about the game. While we have a very strong design philosophy we also believe that we're just mere mortals and that there are a lot of people out there with good ideas and suggestions and we'd like to be able to listen to them.</em>\n<em>To not tap into that would be a missed opportunity as an indie developer wanting to build a solid relationship with its audience.\u201d</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5ef9bb4209dd44e788abe6adc2ec1a09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 446, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joure"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
