Build structures to increase your production, build ships enabling you to conquer surrounding colonies.I hope you will enjoy the game, it is pretty much self-explanatory (grow and conquer). I would like to point out that you will not be able to finish this game in a few hours, it should take much longer than that. When you are short of materials, leave it running in the task-bar for a few hours, your resources will accumulate and you should be able to continue your expansion.<br/><br/>Game will auto-save every 30min and when exiting, it will also auto-load when opening.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/136/13634f174c7fb06062eb3e6d8232b5cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["critic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
