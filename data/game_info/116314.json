You must switch nature tiles until you've converted all the city tiles into nature and found all the victory tiles of the level!<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\nMoving\r\n<p>Use the arrow keys to navigate the tile world. You embody a spirit which moves on top of the game board. A black frame highlights the tile over which the spirit is located.</p>\r\nSwitching\r\n<p>You can select the current tile by hitting the Alt key. This will place a white frame around the tile. When you hit Alt and a tile was already selected, you will switch the selected tile (white frame) with the current one (black frame) if applicable. Tiles can be switch if they are touching, and if they are nature tiles. You cannot move city tiles around.</p>\n<p>Backspace key can be used to unselect the selected tile. Alternatively, you can press Alt while being over the currently selected tile to toggle.<br/></p>\r\nTransforming\r\n<p>Press the space bar to transform a city tile into a nature tile. This will only succeedif the relevant nature tiles are placed next to it, matching the color bordering the city tile. Otherwise, the misplaced neighbors will wiggle a bit to highlight the inconsistencies!</p>\r\nCredits\r\nBy Suzanne Gomont &amp; \u00c9lie Michel\r\n<p>This game was made during a mini-jam, from 10 am to 10 pm, at ATI - Paris 8.</p>\n<p>Some assets have been made using Polyworld.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy it and feel free to contact us!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a65/a65b4161d7730ca35d35f1660c4b9d52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["\u00c9lie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
