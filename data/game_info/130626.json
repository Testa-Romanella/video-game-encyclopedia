Hence, Maximum Mopping was born. </p><p>This game might have had many working titles that were homages to LOTR. :)</p><p>Team:</p><ul><li>Lauren Ridge (@lrridge)</li></ul><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Tap WASD to move around the vault.</li><li>Enter to advance through the info screens.</li><li>Escape to quit</li><li>R restarts the level after the treasure delivery arrives.</li><li>No key necessary to mop - you're just that good at vault scrubbing.</li></ul><p>Game Rules:</p><ul><li>You have a time limit of 45 seconds to clean up as much of the mess in your vault as possible.</li><li>Any skeletons that spawn in make the area around them much more likely to spawn skeletons and mushrooms. </li></ul><p>Additional Credits:</p><ul><li>Most art from Kenney's Game Assets Pack, roguelike sprites (CC0 license)</li><li>Sound effects from Unreal Engine 4 samples: Strategy Game, Unreal Match 3 (UE4 EULA)</li><li>Music from Kenney: Cheerful Annoyance and Wacky Waiting (CC0 license)</li><li>Font from Kenney: KenPixel Mini (CC0 license)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47b/47b9ea27004438f0f02b6e330e8e617f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lrridge"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
