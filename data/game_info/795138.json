All screenshots are in-game :)</p>\r\nThe Story:\u00a0\r\n<p>You are part of Async Research and you're exploring the backrooms. You're trying to compile evidence about recent\u00a0 anomalies in the backrooms without disappearing like your colleges a couple months back.</p>\r\nThe Plan:\r\n<p>\u00a0Over these future months, I plan on adding multiplayer support, structures in the backrooms, entities, and level 1. Depending on the state of the project, I\u00a0will hopefully have a\u00a0early access version released on steam.</p>\n<p>I am also organizing development in a\u00a0Trello here</p>\n<p>https://trello.com/b/PG3CLjlC/backrooms-the-game<br/></p>\r\nWhat I would love:\u00a0\r\n<p><strong><em>Constructive Criticism</em></strong>, I want to know what's wrong with my game. I\u00a0need perspective for that. I appreciate any feedback in my email or comments</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ideas,\u00a0</strong></em>If you have an idea that greatly improves gameplay and I\u00a0end up implementing it. You'll earn yourself a spot in the credits. I'm one person and I again would love perspective on this project!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank\u00a0</strong><strong>you</strong> for visiting this page and checking out my game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>- Louis</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T15:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad0/ad0e84df69f6e76f98705835c4c3780e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Louis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
