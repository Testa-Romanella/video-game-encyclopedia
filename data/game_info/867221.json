I have 0 attention span, 0 time, and 0 knowledge to write and build\u00a0a full-fledged 3D game with intricate stories, plot, and mechanics. This is just a simple visual novel with a streamlined plot and\u00a0partial voices. You should be able to complete everything in like... 30 minutes long in total? Might be\u00a0less, even.</p>\n\r\n\u27e3\u00a0 Content tags \u00a0\u27e2\r\n<p>The game will contain the following:\u00a0established relationship, <strong>FLUFF</strong>, comfort,\u00a0<em>lots</em> of pet names, <strong>suggestive themes</strong>, <em>lots</em> of kissy sounds on some routes,\u00a0implications of violence (not towards player), a sprinkle of protective behavior<br/></p>\n\r\n\u27e3\u00a0\u00a0Who are the love interests?\u00a0\u00a0\u27e2\r\n<p><strong>Zhongli, Xiao, Childe, Diluc, Kaeya, Itto, Kazuha</strong>\n</p>\r\n(Zhongli is selected by default because who doesn\u2019t love geo daddy???)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u27e3\u00a0\u00a0Who's this for?\u00a0\u00a0\u27e2\r\n<p>This is a very self-indulgent project, hence the dialogues were written with <strong>fem!player</strong> in mind. It will contain <strong>suggestive themes</strong>, so please be aware of that before downloading / playing.</p>\n\r\n\u27e3\u00a0\u00a0Is this free to play?\u00a0\u00a0\u27e2\r\n<p>Yes, it's totally <strong>free</strong> - in fact, I do not accept payment.</p>\n\r\n\u27e3\u00a0\u00a0How do I play the game?\u00a0\u00a0\u27e2\r\n<ol><li>Click the link to <strong>download</strong> the appropriate file based on your OS. Only Windows, Linux, and Mac are supported. No, I won't release it on other platforms.\r\n</li><li><strong>Open</strong> the game, and you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s pretty straightforward. Customize your <strong>profile</strong>, select your <strong>love interest</strong>, then <strong>start</strong> the game.\r\n</li><li>There are no wrong answers and the love interest can be changed anytime (just go back to main menu and select the character\u2019s picture on the right side).\r\n</li></ol>\n\r\n\u27e3\u00a0\u00a0Can I share this?\u00a0\u00a0\u27e2\r\n<p>You can personally send links to this post / the game\u2019s itch.io page to your friends via <strong>DMs</strong>, but outside of that (e.g. reposting), <em><strong>NO</strong></em>. For example, posting about this on Reddit is prohibited.\r\n</p>\u27e3\u00a0\u00a0I found an error /\u00a0a bug!!! \u00a0\u27e2<p>File a report here and hopefully I'll eventually get around to fixing the issue.</p>\n\r\n\u27e3\u00a0\u00a0Anything else to note?\u00a0\u00a0\u27e2\r\n<ul><li><em>This is a </em><strong>super casual</strong><em> project.</em>\n</li><li>Scripts are <strong>not proofread</strong>. Probably lots of grammar mistakes.</li><li>Novel format without narration (<strong>full dialogs</strong>).</li><li>There are <strong>no actual sprites</strong>, just official art and something akin to a speech bubble to cater to the characters\u2019 changes in \u2018expression\u2019.\r\n</li><li>There are <strong>voices</strong>, but only <strong>partial</strong> - mostly just grunts, chuckles, kisses, and stuff. I\u2019m using <strong>JP</strong> voices <em>EXCEPT</em> for Itto because Max Mittelman is a gem. No, I will not add other languages' voice versions.\r\n</li><li><strong>Sound cues</strong> and <strong>voices</strong> are quite important for this game so I recommend using <strong>headphones</strong>.</li><li>Depending on <strong>when you open the game</strong> (morning, afternoon, nighttime, midnight), your currently selected love interest might greet you differently.</li><li>To reiterate, <strong>t</strong><strong>here are no wrong answers</strong>.</li><li>Selecting <strong>all talk/act options for a character</strong> will unlock a small event where they'll give you unique gifts.</li><li>I lowkey have so many ideas on how to expand on this in terms of gameplay and options\u00a0but let\u2019s be real here it probably won\u2019t happen lol why can\u2019t my brain be this creative when it comes to work</li><li>Instructions to install can be found below.</li></ul>\n\n\r\n\u27e3\u00a0\u00a0Is this a virus?!???!!!!??!\u00a0\u00a0\u27e2\r\n<p>No... That said, <em>anyone</em> can literally say that. Please be responsible for your own actions.\r\n</p>\n<p>I have also released other games on this itch.io profile, so this isn't my first rodeo. Feel free to\u00a0check the reviews on those before making your decision if you're wary about downloading!\r\n</p>\n\r\n\u27e3\u00a0\u00a0Any last words?\u00a0\u00a0\u27e2\r\n<p>hyv please don't sue me i gain 0 dollars for this and i just wanna simp in peace</p>\n\n<p>---\u00a0\u00a0\u25c7 \u25c6\u00a0\u25c7 \u25c6 \u25c7\u00a0\u25c6 \u25c7\u00a0\u00a0---</p>\n<p>|| Credits\u00a0 \u2727 \u00a0Tumblr ||</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T13:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/3180c53b2ba6c9517c2cbc366624831a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Catherine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
