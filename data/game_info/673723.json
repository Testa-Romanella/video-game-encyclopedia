I have 3 Chickens in my yard that I sometimes let out to roam around. One day as I was bringing them back to their home I thought of how this could be a game. Chickens won't follow you, unless they're hungry, so I'm having to try and herd them in. I started off with the idea of herding chickens but found the game a bit stressful, and found that having them follow you and overcome obstacles was a lot more rewarding.</p>\n<p>Here is a picture of them<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T09:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8b811d933c99fd6e2b2773b78d1e24b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["3chooks"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
