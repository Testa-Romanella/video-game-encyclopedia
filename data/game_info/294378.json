Anything from old rocket parts, to lost astronaut gloves, and maybe even an old banana peel? At 30 000 km/h even the finest debris pose a great threat for future space exploration.<br/><br/>In this amazing game, you get the chance to help scientists and future space travellers to a safe journey by collecting as much debris as possible. Use gravity and carefully calculate the best course. Good luck! ;-)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bd/8bd6f7c8a897a6e9d84c43963ef063ea.jpg", "website": "https://custodiansofspace.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["precisit"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Precisit"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
