{"id": 810745, "slug": "the-floor-is-lava-demo-4", "name": "The Floor is Lava Demo", "name_original": "The Floor is Lava Demo", "description": "<p>Hey there gamers. This is\u00a0my proof of concept/demo of my puzzle platformer, The Floor is Lava. In this game, verticality is your friend as you traverse each level trying to make it to the exit. With brand new experimental mechanics, the developers of these courses have created a new kind of interactive platform that builds the level as you traverse them. The name of the game is this, blue and orange platforms move when you stand on them. Depending on which one you stand on, that will decide how the level plays out. If you step on a blue platform, all blue platforms in the level will move downward, but every orange platform will move upward. You need to think about where you're going, and sometimes you'll need to backtrack to where you've already been. Please enjoy. Any and all feedback is indescribably appreciated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T06:40:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/705/705c7af280ec7556ad68537358ec9ca1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PattyB"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
