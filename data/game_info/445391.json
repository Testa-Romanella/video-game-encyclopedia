Chat with your guests, solve their problems, and influence the vibe of your party throughout the evening. Navigate the space with your cursor, using point-and-click mechanics. After talking to certain guests, you\u2019ll enter into a card game, where you drag and drop cards onto the pool floaty to play them. You only have time to play three card games with your guests, so choose who you want to play against carefully. The vibe and outcomes of card games determine the social dynamics of the characters at your party, so all your actions carry weight. Who will hang out with whom? Can you impress your guests? Will you throw the hot girl summer pool party of your dreams?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T06:52:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c1aba60ea572b51ab6c13eac0f418fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "toplay": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Merry Hospelhorn", "kulfikid", "Thomas Sullivan", "Sasha Scudder"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
