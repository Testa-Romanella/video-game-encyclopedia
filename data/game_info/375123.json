Life is not this unfair, a mate can join you in this fight, you will find (alone or with your friend) upgrades for your ships: more weapons, drones and speed boost!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nFive types of alien await, each of them are unique and will use various weapons and moves to strike you (and your friend)!\r\nEvery wave will be harder and will test your limits!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\r\nSpace Destructor was made by me, Gabriel Jouet, member of Wild Box Studio (check our Facebook's page!), in a short period of time (three weeks, music included and I don't have any skills in FL Studio).\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the game is buggy or anything else (like grammar, music or behavior), feel free to leave a comment! I am always up for feedback!\r\nWhen you download the game I only request you one thing: give me feedback, it helps me improving each day.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\r\nThanks you! You're <strong>awesome!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T05:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a4daa77d8dd24254ab28257e05f999a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gabriel Jouet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
