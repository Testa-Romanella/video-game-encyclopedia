My primary roles were\u00a0level, puzzle, and narrative designer. I designed both the level and visual style of the game,\u00a0and created the entire\u00a0environment in Unity, from the particle systems, to collision boxes, to placing each tree and bush and crystal by hand. I also played a large part in puzzle design, conceptualizing the puzzles with my partner and conceiving\u00a0them in Unity. Furthermore, I\u00a0played a usability role, playtesting the game and making changes based on players' needs in order to create the best player experience possible.</p>\n\n<p>Music:\u00a0Faron Woods, from The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword and Aurora by Hans Zimmer</p>\n<p>All trees, rocks, crystals, mushrooms, textures, skyboxes, and particle effects were from the asset package Dreamscapes. All other assets were free on the asset store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1c/d1c2518ed0e9f5df3824d07b166031df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JetaluskiPro", "Eva Wierzbicki"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
