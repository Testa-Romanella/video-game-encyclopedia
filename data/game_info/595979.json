It seems like it is some kind of a software, that has been used (or rather was planned to be used, as I have never heard about that before) to boost productivity of Amazonbar's employees.</p>\n<p>I could not make my mind of it, and I would love to ask my mother, who probably brought that CD home, as worked as a software engineer in their software division, unfortunately she has died in a car accident back in 1996.</p>\n<p>There was what it looks like an internal memo attached to the case, containing following statement:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>Dear [employee name],</p>\n<p>If you read this, your manager probably noted considerable decrease in your productivity. Here in Amazonbar</p>\n<p>Industries, we expect everyone in our staff to do their best to keep the operation running. However, we understand, that in the end everyone is just a human.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we are incredibly happy to inform you, that you have met the conditions to enter the test run</p>\n<p>of 'Deeper Sleep' program. At Amazonbar, we do care about our staff member's happiness and well-being (that's</p>\n<p>why we don't need worker unions!), and we are 100% sure, that software you are about to use will do just that.</p>\n<p>Amazonbar Software has made sure, that program you are about to use is 100% safe for your health*, and we are</p>\n<p>making sure, that every employee enters it as a volunteer**.</p>\n<p>So waste no time, start the program immediately and get ready, to deliver a better future even more efficiently!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>[Heads of HR department name]</p>\n<p>Director of HR Department</p>\n<p>Amazonbar Industries USA</p>\n<p>* By using DEEPER SLEEP you recognize, that Amazonbar Industries is responsible for any negative effect of that</p>\n<p>software</p>\n<p>** Refusal to take part in that experiment may result in losing holiday benefit, or immediate termination of your contract</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>I could not make my mind of it, so I dumped the CD into a zip archive (the .exe seems to run surprisingly well even on Windows 10), feel free to download it, and see for yourself.</p>\n<p>===============================================================</p><p>special thanks to\u00a0TandyRum1024 for his awesome CRT shader effect<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T16:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6f/e6fddefe5ffa535b00464206742c1d2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["damoch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
