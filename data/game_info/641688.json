Maybe they're eating their favorite food, maybe they're playing with other dogs, or maybe they're imagining themselves as a giant werewolf monster fighting hordes of vikings, skeletons, and demons! Last year I quit my job and dedicated myself to getting to the bottom of this answer. I returned home and explained my plan to Wilma, the family dog, who agreed to assist. After many months of grueling research utilizing the latest cutting edge science, we can finally take a look into Wilma's Dreams!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWilma has dreamt up an interesting little world to play in. I think she's watched too many violent movies because each one of her dreams has her facing hordes of different types of enemies that attack her in never ending waves, each stronger than the last. Thankfully as the one in control of her dreams, she's well equipped to face off against the monsters. She can jump and dash her way around and has a strong one two attack combo which can take any threat down. Thankfully there are some friends for her, when she's exploring sometimes a friendly human will make her stronger. She must have seen me play video games too because she's even keeping track of score for some reason...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat you're about to play is the culmination of our research. Many hours of play testing and peer review have verified that this is a very accurate simulation of what's going on in her head. However, with limited funds I've only been able to replicate her dreams as a side scrolling 2D fighting game. There are a total of 4 different areas to explore on the map, and a total of 11 enemies you will face. When you jump in, your goal will be to explore the map, grow stronger, and survive as long as you can earning as high of a score as possible to make Wilma proud!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T02:27:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91e/91ea7b32238e173f5d4ccc57beb8be34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Sciortino"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Michael Sciortino"], "esrb_rating": null}
