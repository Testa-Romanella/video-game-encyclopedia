A giant worm is destroying the world and you and your friends have to escape it! Along the way you can pick up and throw items to stun players or collect the powerups inside them. The powerups increase your stun duration, throw distance, jump height, and run speed. Use them to your advantage to take out your friends and be the last one alive!<br/></p><p>The game requires at least two players to start and must be played with controllers. Most controllers will work. There is a known issue where controllers shutting off or connecting to the computer while playing will cause all controllers to disconnect so please make sure to power on all controllers before starting the game.</p><p>Game by Anthony Tesija (@AntonTesh)</p><p>Music and Sound Effects by Daniel Latterner Jr.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/88945925efa96165ecdec93414e71221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Tesija"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
