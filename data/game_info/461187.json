In its depht lies an ancient artifact, the Ice Heart, which constitue a great source of power. When her brother, blinded by anger, attacked her village and left for Tekis, Elyria had no other choices to leave to the next kingdom to try to build an army to stop him and protect the artifact. In Hespal War, fight waves of enemies by placing units arround the path, and travel this world torn by a war between two kingdoms. I created this tower defense during my first year of study at Isart Digital in 2013.\u00a0 <strong>Game in French.</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- Christophe Galati: Game Design, Programming, Pixel Art</p>\n<p>- Samy Shbib: Composer</p>\n<p>- Clara Sorobablet: Character Design</p>\n<p>- Guillaume Kuc: Web Design and Background Artist<br/></p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T04:34:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/338/3382409472d921aca4c4dedd72c27695.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChrisDeneos"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
