{"id": 545145, "slug": "vip-rebels", "name": "VIP Rebels", "name_original": "VIP Rebels", "description": "\" The horn sounds..., the gate opens,... YOUR RUN STARTS NOW!  ...\"<h3>How to play</h3><br/>You will start each game selecting three VIPs, each with their own unique special skill. After you select your VIP, you start your run. Whenever you start a run, you\u2019ll choose how many villagers you use to collect resources like wood, food, and gold. The villagers drop resources at your treasure wagon and look for new sources automatically throughout the run.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the gate opens, you will enter the procedurally generated lands of the Red, where you\u2019ll need to get as far as you can in order to claim the best rewards. Venture further and further and more secret rewards and treasure will be granted. <br/><br/>You\u2019ll have VIPs such as King Midas who has the ability to turn enemies into gold, the Viking, a dragon-summoning Nordic god, Blackbeard the pirate, ordering deadly cannonballs to obliterate enemies, or the Rocket Man with the power to land two rockets simultaneously on top of your enemies. These are just a few of the 25 VIPs that you\u2019ll encounter along the way. More are planned and I'm looking to bring this number closer to 100.<br/><br/>There are big pirate armies that lie ahead of you, with bands of rebels hidden away in bushes and villages to slow your progress. Whether castles stand in the way or not, you will need to overcome the odds and create an army with the right mixture of units to counter the enemies ahead of you. Will you pick archers to mow down the slow infantry and risk them being charged down by cavalry? The choice is yours.<br/><br/>Once you finally get stopped, you\u2019ll collect treasure and rewards, unlock, and upgrade more VIPs and return to the open gate once more.<h3>So in short:</h3>- Select unique VIPs giving you strategic advantages.<br/>- Collect resources and build your army.<br/>- Take control of dragons and transform sheep into bloodthirsty warmachines <br/>- Win &amp; lose big battles in your fight for loot.<br/>- Claim big rewards, unlock and upgrade new VIPs as you progress.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Quick note of the developer</h3>Hi there, <br/>I just wanted to say thanks for showing an interest in the thing I\u2019ve been passionate about for the last 3 years. We\u2019ve made this journey together and I hope that you\u2019re as hyped about this project as I am. :) <br/><br/>I started out wanting to create an RTS game for the Age of Empires fan inside me that doesn\u2019t have the ability to sink hours into playing a game. The game is a bunch of quick fun runs, intertwined with big battles and resource gathering. On average, each run should take between 10 and 15 minutes.<br/><br/>If you like what I\u2019m doing here and want to keep updated, please add the game to your Steam Wishlist to support me.<br/>I will always love you for it! <br/>\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af<br/><br/>R.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T03:24:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d10/d100d192cd4503c9b93afb0e527acf41.jpg", "website": "http://www.viprebels.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Rooms"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digital Rooms"], "esrb_rating": null}
