{"id": 522468, "slug": "undeafen", "name": "UnDeafen", "name_original": "UnDeafen", "description": "<p>UnDeafen is a first-person horror game mixed with the element of deafness. In the game, you are a deaf female scientist on a spaceship while one of your test subjects broke free and killed the lights.\u00a0The objective of the game is to fix five machines while chasing away the \"test subject\" who is very sensitive to your flashlight.\u00a0UnDeafen is created not only to include deaf gamers but also to\u00a0represent deafness and what it sounds like. The game gives players the ability to freely switch between hearing-aid-on and off, which basically gives them the choice to play in either a deaf person's perspective of the world or the ones of the normal-hearing person. Both perspectives give players different types of buffs that I thought would stick closer to reality.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to check out this game and leave me with some feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T05:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31c/31c28af013c646c0147da1ca0602ea71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jingkai Bob Wu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
