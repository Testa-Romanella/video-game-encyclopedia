Go through 15 different levels and, solve those puzzles!</p><p>Ulipity is a simple puzzle game I made, to test out my skills as a puzzle designer. The result was I made Ulipity, and got a lot more experience in Game Maker Studio. This marks my first actual finished game for release. While I think I could work on it more, to make it better, right now I wish to start a new project. Possibly there may be a new update, with more levels and mechanics, but not anytime soon.</p><p>Also if you're trying to go windowed or fullscreen use F11.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96bc9b501fcb51a133a75d8f58340131.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VKuru"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
