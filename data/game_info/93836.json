I would say 90% of the time I spent was to recreate the map.</p>\n<p>Note : The game has no sound, that's why I called it Grand Theft Audio.</p>\n<p>Note 2 : The game uses no texture, only colors and low poly shapes.</p>\n<p><strong>Missions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- When you start the game, in the first mission, you need to go to the Hideout. It's on the left side of the map.</p>\n<p>Tip : Look in the sky for the blue ray if you need help, this is the place you need to go.</p>\n<p>- Then you can search for Hidden Packages. They are at the same place as the original game, except for the ones that are located in places I didn't have time to finish. In that case the package is near the location, or I didn't put the package at all.</p>\n<p>Tip : You can easily find guides on internet to find every package in the game. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Quit the game : Escape</li></ul>\n<p><strong>- On foot</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Move : WASD or ZQSD (both works)</li><li>Jump : Space</li><li>Enter in a car : F</li><li>Camera : Move the mouse</li></ul>\n<p><strong>- In a car</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Accelerate : W or Z</li><li>Go back : S</li><li>Go Left : A or Q</li><li>Go Right : D</li><li>Get out of the car : F</li><li>Look at the Left side : Left clic (mouse)</li><li>Look at the Right side : Right clic (mouse)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Things used</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Engine\u00a0:\u00a0Unity</li><li>Fonts : Pricedown, Montserrat</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3e/f3e9b4ea45836fc30e1ee263aa83f0a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Roucasse"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
