The game is inspired by SteamPunk, because I really like SteamPunk - Big robots, Steam weapons .... that's amazing! I know that\u00a0 not everyone like SteamPunk, or pixel art games ... When you play it please keep in mind that the game was made by one 14 boy. If you compare Steam Quest with my next game - Cruasaders Cut, I hope that you will see a lot of progress ... or maybe just a litte bit progress. Finally, thank you for downloading and dont afraid from writing a comment!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c9/7c9d49125227669ec5507a6f39a1b9ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EdenSoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
