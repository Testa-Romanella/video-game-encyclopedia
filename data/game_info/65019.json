You and your companions are alive, but recovery from the impact is short lived; a large shape is moving towards you. As it gets closer you rub your eyes in disbelief: a Dinosaur! Where are you?... and when? Now learn to survive in a world untouched by modern life; a world frozen in time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStunning graphics and startling action in this thrilling innovative game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHazards to be faced include the aforementioned dinosaurs and cavemen, as well as sea monsters, precarious mountainous ledges and dilapidated bridges. Objects including weapons and first aid kits can be collected. Each character has his own distinct behaviors - one becomes hungry easily, while another is only really competent while his fianc\u00e9e survives. Although the ultimate aim is to save all four characters, you can continue while at least one is alive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T11:59:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e82/e829d9446d3df9a322ba143efe5d8caf.jpg", "website": "http://classicsdigital.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 142, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ocean Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Piko Interactive", "Classics Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
