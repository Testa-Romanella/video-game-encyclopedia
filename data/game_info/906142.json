Mr Rapp handed me the deed to the land and real estate. I am amazed at the beauty of the place. Most of its inhabitants are hardworking families with a desire to progress. I have been visiting them these days to give them everything they need to work and produce: goods, tools, money. With God's help we will make this a cooperative community, where there are no exploited workers. There is no need to make a revolution when your workers find joy in their labor.</p>\n<p>-Robert Owen<br/></p>\n\r\nCode:\r\n<p>Clumsy Snail:\u00a0https://magno-m-s-silva.itch.io/</p>\r\nStory and historical research:\r\n<p>Algieba:\u00a0https://algieba15.itch.io/ </p>\r\nArt:\r\n<p>SmugAlbatross:\u00a0https://sam-scribbler.itch.io/</p>\r\nMusic:\r\n<p>Nobarr:\u00a0https://sul-iac.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:50:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/51840722e4c9c028d6fb639628512c05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Scribbler", "Magno-M-S-Silva", "Sul_iac", "Algieba15"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
