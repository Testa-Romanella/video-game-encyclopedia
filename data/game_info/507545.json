{"id": 507545, "slug": "rpsrts", "name": "RPSRTS", "name_original": "RPSRTS", "description": "<p>RPSRTS is the first game I\u00a0ever made.\u00a0It uses no explicit game engine, just Java AWT and\u00a0Affine Transforms to create a\u00a0pseudo-3D effect.</p>\n<p>You play as the RED team fighting the computer controlled BLU team. The objective is to build an army and destroy the BLU base.</p>\n<p>Whenever rock attacks paper, paper attacks scissors or scissors attack rock, they benefit from a x2 damage bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This game has no audio.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The game is controlled with the mouse. Left click to interact and pan, right click to rotate and use the scroll wheel, middle mouse or left+right mouse buttons together to zoom.</p>\r\nUnits\r\n<p>When unit production is set to green, your buildings will automatically spawn new units up to your cap while you have sufficient resources.\u00a0<strong>Rocks</strong>\u00a0are your tanks, they are expensive and slow but strong. They can dish out a huge amount of damage in a small time.\u00a0<strong>Paper</strong>\u00a0are skirmishers, they are speedy and cheap to produce. They go down quickly but can be dangerous in packs.\u00a0<strong>Scissors</strong>\u00a0are the infantry, they are all-rounders and do not suffer the weaknesses or gain the bonuses of the other units.</p>\r\nBuildings\r\nRockeries, Smelters and Wood shops\r\n<p>Your units will automatically man your buildings and gather resources for the war effort. Once all resources in range have been consumed, you can sell the building to recoup 50% of the construction costs.</p>\r\nAttractor Totems\r\n<p>Totems are instant to build, resilient to attack and can be relocated around the map by dragging. Your units will muster around your totems so use them to rally a defence or go on the offensive. Totems cost 25 resources.</p>\r\nMain Base\r\n<p>Your base is your link to the world. Loose it and it\u2019s game over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85ddea7fe11292fffb8e70268b63c190.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["timboe"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
