Well stop wondering and try it instead!</strong></p>\n<p>In Power Surge you can unleash you inner murderous robot and defeat an infected world of monsters. Conquer the leaderboard and show you friends how's the boss of this world!</p>\n<p>The game was created for the Classic Ludum Dare Game Jam during 72 hours by a single developer (aka me Neathan). I used Unity 2017 as an engine and Paint.net for art.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The goal with the game is to kill as many monsters as you can and at the same prevent your batteries to run dry. When you kill a monster they drop energy essence. Just by walking close to the essence your battery automatically attracts and collects it. This will add charge to your battery that will help you to stay alive. If your charge reaches zero you're out.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><em>Keyboard:</em></p>\n<p>Left Arrow + Right Arrow = Move</p>\n<p>Z = Jump \u00a0 X = Shoot \u00a0 Space = Start</p>\n<p><em>Controller: (Only windows)</em></p>\n<p>Left joystick = Move</p>\n<p>X / A = Jump \u00a0 Square / X / = Shoot \u00a0 Start = Start</p>\n<p>Circle / B = Alt Jump \u00a0 Triangle / Y = Alt Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>Web:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow the following link to access the web version:\u00a0https://neathan.github.io/Running-out-of-Power/\u00a0(Bug in safari, chrome confirmed to work)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d5de7ac4c1d5bd7b0c7c1afa8e14cd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Neathan"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
