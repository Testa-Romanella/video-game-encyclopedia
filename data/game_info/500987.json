{"id": 500987, "slug": "in-nature", "name": "In Nature", "name_original": "In Nature", "description": "<p>Use WASD to move around and move the mouse to look around.</p>\n<p>(In the game, press M to go back to the Main Menu)</p><p>In Nature is a game where players can explore nature to relieve stress. My thesis is about how playing games can\u00a0 turn us into cyborgs. The definition of a cyborg is an organic being using inorganic attachments to enhance their innate abilities. Marshall McLuhan states that media is an extension of us. Therefore by playing games, we can use video games to enhance our abilities, whether it is memory, or reaction times, similar to how glasses enhance our sight.. The goal of this game is to improve mental health and help relax the user. Ideally, if this game was in VR it would serve as a better representation of players becoming more cyborg-like, however I assumed not everyone has a VR set, so instead I made the game in a first-person viewpoint.</p>\n<p>(It seems like WebGL wasn't able to render the lake, so the water turned black. There also seems to be some framerate issues, which I believe is also WebGL being unable to process the game.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:33:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c40d3d0e7c5153bcfab2865fd51610e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["andrewoid"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
