You may say to yourself, \"Well that sounds easy\", however, that is where you would be wrong -\u00a0ENTROPY is a challenging game with a range of difficulty settings to play through, and if you really want a challenge, you can even edit the generation settings yourself to make the perfect difficulty that may take hours or days to complete! If you need to the game has a save and return feature so that you can leave and come back to resume the challenge.</p>\n<p>Please do try it out. At the moment this is only a test to see the games reception. If it is well received I may see how far I can take this project :)</p>\n\r\nAlso if you don't mind, rating and leaving some feedback in the comments section below\u00a0will help me improve and create\u00a0better games!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75f/75f9f7ff5a4b67e65c90bca7c2ce3e48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jayden Chapman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
