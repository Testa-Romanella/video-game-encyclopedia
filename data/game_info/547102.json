The only way to escape is with the software, what state this software is in is decided by the events the player puts in motion!\r\n  \r\nEach night go and search for computers that have been left on so you can activate up to twenty different events. Each Event can have a positive or negative impact on the software\u2019s outcome, but this needs to be balanced with subtlety as doing too much will tip off the developers that you have escaped. \u00a0Another Issue for the Player is that the AI can only stay outside of computers or power sockets for a certain amount of time!\r\n  \r\nAfter the AI survives each night by returning to the original computer in the corner office. The office is then simulated, generating different responses to each of the Players Actions. The player can see the developer\u2019s reaction to each of their actions by reading through the active computers\u2019 emails.\r\n  \r\n\u00a0\r\n  \r\nMovement\r\nTypes Of Movement\r\n  \r\nNormal \u2013 This is where you are running around on the floor use WASD for movement\r\n  \r\nData over power \u2013 This allows you to use the electrical sockets and wiring to move around the room faster.
