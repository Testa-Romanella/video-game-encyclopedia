Making use of traditional Scottish weaponry, such as golf clubs and haggis catapults, the band of Scotsmen must defend locations around Scotland, Wales and England, as they defend their homeland, and then take the fight to the enemy.<br/><br/><ul><li>Fight wacky enemies: Welshmen who ride sheep into battle, English teapot hurlers, Irish potato farmers, and many more.<br/></li><li>Build crazy defensive structures including porridge cannons, turnip turrets and cheese wheel stations.<br/></li><li>Building defenses is only half the equation.
