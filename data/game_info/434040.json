But it was without taking into account the empty gaze of his moronic cat in front of his corpse, which gave him an idea: why not exchange one of his pet\u2019s nine lives for his own from the god of cats? The god\u2019s housing being at the top of a volcano, this trip is going to be full of peril ; but keeping this debilitated cat alive until the top may be even harder\u2026</p>\n<p>Through the master\u2019s specter which is no longer able to directly interact with his animal, you will have to guide him on the dangerous roads of the volcano armed with a horn, dried cat food, and a vacuum cleaner. Be careful however, the cat moves alone and is not aware of the risks of falling. Will you be able to keep the animal alive, allowing the owner to resuscitate ? The god of cats challenges you !</p>\n<p>Thanx to all participants :\r\nALLARD \u201cTec\u201d Christophe,\r\nCHIANESE \u201cYujji\u201d Benjamin,\r\n\u0110\u1eacU Qu\u1ef3nh Anh,\r\nDURAN Mary,\r\nGRAULE \u201cSolarLiner\u201d Nathan,\r\nGOUARDERES \u201cNexi\u201d Claudine,\r\n\u201cKlemm\u201d,\r\nPEROT \u201cSky\u201d Fabien,\r\nKOSSEL \u201cXkira07\u201d Lowin,\r\nTRAN \u201cPh\u00e9nix\u201d Valentin,\r\n\u201cVarga\u201d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T07:39:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe3/fe3e0cc7183699b8e39f3b5edbcb5073.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thechrist"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
