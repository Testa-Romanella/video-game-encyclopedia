You live in a small town, and it's late. There aren't any stores open nearby, but there is that one Halloween store in the town open. You drive there, to find the store dark, but the doors are open. You figure you'll just borrow some costume pieces real quick and return them in the morning. Upon entering, the door shut behind you... and you're not alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Dan Dennis</p>\n<p>Haylie Ingels</p>\n<p>David Sand</p>\n<p>Mike Schubert</p>\n<p>Robby Williams</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T07:24:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a6/8a6ec4b6b15046d0de3b2eaf15b09424.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mikeschubee", "robbytaku", "HaylieIngels", "C_Pancake"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
