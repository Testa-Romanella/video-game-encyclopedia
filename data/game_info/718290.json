I'm not happy with a lot of things in this game as-is; after the jam, I plan on fleshing out this story WAY more and drawing all my own graphics.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Reverberation\u00a0</em>is a story told solely through visuals and sound, about a 16 year old girl named Scarlett experiencing her world in a different light for the first time.

(Prior to that, the most I'd done was sprite the inside of somebody's house.) A huge part of the struggle was trying to convey as much story as I could through symbols, sound effects and Scarlett's expressions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Songs created by Rinzai Gigen!\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/rinzai-gigen</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Sprites:</p>\n<p>Edits/Creations I made myself<br/>RPGMaker MV Default Tileset<br/>https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/com_sho-mv-rtp-tileset-pack.130...<br/>https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/aquas-modern-tiles.68465/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T04:30:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecc/ecc53bc82b2adbe7852d8de52401bf1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AwesomeTrinket"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
