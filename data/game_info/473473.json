{"id": 473473, "slug": "zombie-game-demo", "name": "Zombie Game Demo", "name_original": "Zombie Game Demo", "description": "<p>A 2D survival rogue-like game where the goal is to survive as long as possible by gathering food, weapons, and avoiding Zombies! I started by following a 2D dungeon crawler tutorial and expanded upon it to create a survival experience that focused more on puzzle-like environments than combat. This project is still being developed, but you can download the early demo from the link below!</p>\n<p>Features :\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Procedural Level Generation to make the environments feel different from play through to play through. </li><li>Scarce but powerful weapons that can be used against Zombie foes.</li><li>Numerous environmental elements that can be used to outsmart enemies!</li><li>Multiple resources to manage as you strive to reach the highest level possible.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Note: This is a demo for a game still in development. Content you see now is not final and many things (such as art assets, sound, and game mechanics) are subject to change. Current future goals include additional items, rare preset room layouts, hidden modifiers, additional enemy types, and more!</p><p>How to Play:</p><p>W, A, S, D to move.</p><p>Move into objects to interact or collect them.</p><p>Move into enemies while holding a knife to defeat them.</p><p>Use the Arrow Keys in the direction you want\u00a0to shoot if you have a gun and bullets.</p><p>If there is a key in the level, it must be collected before you are allowed to move on. If there are generators in the level, both must be activated before you are allowed to move on.\u00a0</p><p>Avoid hazards and collect food to keep going. If your food reaches 0, its game over!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T06:14:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7af7bf466e8a1414e9029123161c17ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gonnzo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
