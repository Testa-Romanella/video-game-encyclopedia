Me and my friend Yit had a lot of fun working on the game\u00a0but we got crunched on time so the game is somewhat buggy. The music was the most rushed of all.</p>\n<p>The game is beatable (yes this version you're playing) however, due to some error some of the button textures are invisible so you'll have to be crafty to figure out where they're hiding. Let's pretend it's a feature okay \ud83d\ude09. There's also a repeat level, so just play through that, it's not intentional but just act like it is.</p>\n<p>One hint before you start:\u00a0The dark level with rotated electric fields is the trickiest level of all since it involves using a bug to get to one of the areas in the level. If you get through that one then great job.</p>\n<p>Another hint:\u00a0It's easier to move left and up than it is to move right and up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's all. RIP visible buttons.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T13:49:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45b7b9e2ac0bbb5c5ad7e56a3f329d35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TrueRegin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
