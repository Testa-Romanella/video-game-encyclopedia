Master the pulse-pack to outmaneuver your opponents and deliver the killing blow.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is no single-player or networked multiplayer mode, so at least one controller is required to play the game. I recommend an Xbox 360 controller.</p>\n<p>This is an open alpha of the game, so any and all feedback is much appreciated (divforgegames@gmail.com).</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Move - WASD or Left Analog Stick</p>\n<p>Dash - Space or Left Bumper</p>\n<p>Aim - Mouse or Right Analog Stick</p>\n<p>Shoot - Left-click or Right Trigger</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Game by David Ford.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to Pepys for the music.
