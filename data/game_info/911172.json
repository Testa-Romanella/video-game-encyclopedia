So I started picking away at this little digital space. <br/>I mostly code when making games, so this was quite a challenge because most of it was modelling. Once the summer ended, I realized just how monumental this project was for a single dev with rudimentary modeling/texturing skills so I put it down. Maybe I'll return to it one day, maybe I won't be able to. I'm glad I made it, I'm glad I got to learn more about YKK's world.</p>\n<p>To play your own music enter the $game_location%/Cafe Alpha_Data/StreamingAssets/ folder and read the .txt in there!\r\n</p>\n<p><em>If anyone wishes to continue working on the game, I'd gladly hand over my assets, research and unity project.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\"The night of humanity, may it be a peaceful age.\"</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T16:05:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/028/0287dc366b03279b331eef013f767e53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AavaGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
