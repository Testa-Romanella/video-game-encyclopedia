I made it in about 3 hours and\u00a0submitted it to the Community Game Jam 2019. The game was pretty bad, but whatever. It has now been 1 year since I released, so I decided to remake the game in less than 1 hour. This build is the result of that. I remade the character, and added a new animation to it. So this build is closer to the original idea that I had when I originally thought of the game (all of the ideas for the original game were ironed out in less than a minute). So to do this, I reused a couple assets: 2 NPC sprites, 2 text assets, 1 crate sprite, and 1 cloud sprite, and the music. The rest of it I made within the time limits. That is all.</p><p>All assets (music, art, etc) were made by Black Frog Studios.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T05:40:58", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Black Frog Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
