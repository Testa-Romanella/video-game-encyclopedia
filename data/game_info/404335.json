At first glance it looks easy, but each level becomes more and more challenging and addicting.</p>\n<p>Combine tiles with numbers till you receive 12, more numbers added more starts are collected! If you managed to combine 11 tiles you are real math genius or maybe you are cheating?? You will definitely need stars to unlock new level and progress through the game. But please be careful, in case of incorrect sum you will get blocking tile which cannot be used till end of the game. Your goal is to collect defined number of starts as quickly as you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T04:05:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdf/bdf3653f41585ea6735818f428da8113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Stiexeno"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
