Gameplay is fairly basic, rock-paper-scissors. You can play without a twich account but whole point of the game is interacting with viewers so, its not fun to play with bots. If you need token get from the site, and paste it on settings.</p><p>You play with Arrows or WASD, and 1,2,3 keys to select R / P / S. Click or spacebar to time your attack.</p><p>Viewers can join the game by entering \"<strong>!join</strong>\" or \"!join [letter]\" like \"<strong>!join r</strong>\" * a letter of \"rps\" as their selection. If a viewer doesn't type the letter it gets a random move. If more than max count of players are entered, some of them are randomly eliminated, streamer plays with the 6 of them.<br/></p><p>If you play at twitch, please let me know :) I'm at twitch.tv/chinomaker and @FreeDomeStudio on twitter.<br/></p><p>The streamer as an inspiration was SydWeiler, so I used the Sushi concept on her channel. You can follow her at https://www.twitch.tv/sydweiler. </p><p>[LD Post-jam] version,first build was non-playable Kappa :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac5/ac5a91a004f9557029a0b61c660e4fb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FreeDome Studio - Sinan Acar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
