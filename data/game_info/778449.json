There isn't too much in the game right now, but with each month I will be releasing new content, such as updated art, more mini games, quests, new systems of interaction and so much more! Follow me on twitter or YouTube to keep up with the development process, you might even catch some sneak peaks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T06:25:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab4/ab4de7c96e8ef5283423c639969f8b49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mikenunz1"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
