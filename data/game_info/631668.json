Now that a year or two has passed, I wanted to rebuild this project using all of the new methods I've learned over that time. My goal was to ensure that the project files were fully documented, and could help other GDevelop users learn some of these more advanced concepts once they've learned the basics.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Move:\u00a0D-Pad on gamepads, A or D\u00a0keys on the keyboard</li><li>Jump:\u00a0\u00a0Cross or A on gamepads, J key on keyboard</li><li>Attack: Square or X on gamepads, K key on keyboard</li><li>Dash: Circle or B on gamepads, O key on keyboard</li></ul>\n<p>You can also enable some debug visuals to see some of the more backend objects:</p>\n<ul><li>Numpad + key:\u00a0Show all debug objects</li><li>Numpad\u00a0- key:\u00a0Hide all debug objects</li><li>Numpad * key: Show all visible object hitboxes and points.</li><li>Numpad / key:\u00a0Hide all visible object hitboxes and points.</li></ul>\n<p>Additional detail:\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project is meant as a game example or template for a more advanced platformer. This is in the style of older castlevania entries, such as Castlevania 1 or 3.</p>\n<p>There are numerous advanced GDevelop concepts in this project, such as finite state machines (FSMs), tweens, bitmap fonts and bitmap text objects, tilemaps, external event sheets, declaring variables via events, and object variables.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before working with this project, it is STRONGLY recommended that you review the following:</p>\n<p>At least the first four tutorials on the GDevelop Wiki: http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/tutorials\u00a0This example uses concepts from EACH of those tutorials and it is important to understand those concepts before trying to adapt these ideas.</p>\n<p>The finite state machine tutorial at: http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/tutorials/finite_state_machine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:04:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f1/1f1c277ab71df1413f4c16c5dcd9c3f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Silver-Streak"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
