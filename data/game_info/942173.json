Have a good day and goodbye!</p>\n\n<p>PS: i used GM1.4 so it has some limitations, the main is that i couldn't add more sounds to the project, if i tried so the game wouldn't open, so i had to overwrite some existing sound files and use them for the purpose that i was planing, so the game lacks on soundtracks, but it has background sounds and everything. I tried i really tried but it just wouldn't work,\u00a0sorry about that :,)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T13:58:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a3ac04240fa4c60f296f9a4dd0365ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zCAJUINA"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
