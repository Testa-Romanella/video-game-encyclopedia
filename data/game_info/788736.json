Its maw looms before you, radiating darkness.</p>\n<p>Your feet threaten to betray you, but the promise of great power hidden within steels your heart.</p>\n<p>The tomb is your only hope to depose the dread pathlord Ludranum. You must not turn back.</p>\n<p>Armed with your trusty journal and the instructions inside, you warily approach the tomb.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The Insatiable Tomb of Ratakanen is an exploration/light horror game. Seeking the power that lies inside, you've entered the labyrinthine caves. In this cavern, light is prohibited. You must navigate using only your sense of touch and your keen memory.</p>\n<p>People who enter the tomb come out in less than an hour, or not at all. Will you fall victim to Ratakanen's hunger, or will you find what you are seeking?</p>\n<p>Only time will tell.</p>\n\n<p>Mouse &amp; keyboard and controller are both supported. Controls are rebindable.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>WASD/Left Stick - Movement\r\n</p>\n<p>F/Bottom Button\u00a0- Interact</p>\n<p>Esc/Start - Menu/Pause\r\n</p>\n<p>J/Back - Open Journal</p>\n\n<p>Some answers are hidden to avoid spoilers. If you want to know the answer, just highlight the text.</p>\n<p><strong>Will I enjoy this game?</strong></p>\n<p>The vast majority of this game is wandering around a maze in complete darkness. If that doesn't sound fun to you, you will not enjoy this game.</p>\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\n<p>I was reading <em>The Tombs of Atuan</em>, by Ursula K. LeGuin (excellent book), and the description of the tomb captured my interest. The protagonist moving around a pitch black tomb using only their sense of touch intrigued me. Since touch isn't really a sense used in video games, I was wondering how I could provide an analogue to that.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the\u00a0labyrinth work?</strong></p>\n<p>The tomb never crosses over itself, nor are there one-way paths or teleports. It can be mapped on a piece of paper. It is not randomly generated, and is the same for everyone. There are pits, and landing in one <em>will</em> kill you.</p>\n<p><strong>Wondering what horror content is in the game (jump scares, pursuers)?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no jump scares, nor are their any pursuers. As long as you didn't dare to bring a light into the tomb, your progress will be unhindered.</p>\n<p><strong>Any content warnings?</strong></p>\n<p>Lots and lots of darkness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T17:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/294f8318018babdfc8137e1d7d498d19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Hutchins"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
