{"id": 818486, "slug": "dice-n-dungeons", "name": "Dice 'n Dungeons", "name_original": "Dice 'n Dungeons", "description": "<p>A somewhat rogue-like dice-based game made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022.</p>\n<p>The theme was 'Roll of the Dice', so I decided to make a board-game like where you roll dice to determine your actions.</p>\n<p>However, I wanted to do to much and ran out of time (48 hours).</p>\n<p>Due to this, there is no music, almost no animations and a big part of the rogue-like experience is missing, due to there being no randomization.<br/></p>\n<p>The idea of the game is that you start with 3 heroes (Warrior, Mage and Druid) and go over a map battling enemies along the way.</p>\n<p>The battle is set on a Hex-Map and your actions are determined by a Roll of the Dice. Each die can have multiple faces with multiple actions. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>How To Play<br/></strong></p>\n<p>When on the overworld map, you'll see your Hero (Blue warrior) and a map of paths and enemies. At first, only the first two battles are open. You can click on either of them to move there and initiate the battle. If you win, you'll unlock the next battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Battling<br/></strong></p>\n<p>When you start a battle, the map will be populated with your heroes and the enemies. Press the 'Roll' button to roll your Heroes' dice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When rolled, the dice can be found at the lower side of the board. Click on them in order to activate their actions.</p>\n<p>When you feel like you're done with your turn, click the 'Next Turn' button. This'll pass the turn over to the AI.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You win if there are no more enemies left, you lose if there are no more allies left.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>\r\nIcon/Name<br/>MoveMove the unit X places.<br/>AttackThe unit attacks a nearby unit (Melee)<br/>FireballThe unit attack an enemy (Ranged)<br/>Thunder ShockThe unit stuns an enemy, removing one of their dice in the next round<br/>RootThe unit roots an enemy, locking their movement actions next round<br/>EmbiggenThe unit embiggens a rolled die, tripling their damage/range<br/>\n<p>After a battle, you were supposed to be able to edit your dice, building your Heroes along the way. Due to time constraints, this is not (yet) implemented.</p>\n<p>Also, expect many a bug.
