{"id": 751206, "slug": "spooky-bodies", "name": "Spooky Bodies", "name_original": "Spooky Bodies", "description": "Spooky Bodies\r\n<p>In Spooky Bodies you play as the last knight who wants to find his way out of the castle. As the castle is full of traps you die pretty quickly and become a ghost. As a ghost you can now possess any dead body to bring it back to life. Both of your forms provide you with unique skills such as going through walls, when being a ghost. It comes down to juggling between both of your forms in order to solve the puzzles hindering you to escape the castle.</p>\r\nHow does the game fit the theme?\r\n\n<p>Spencer Spaggi is the last survivor after the battle of Castle Wobblewalls. He just wants to escape the piles of dead bodies. His escape doesn't go that well, as he dies to the first trap he encounters. As a ghost he strolls through the castle grounds bringing the dead bodies back to life as he possesses them to help him on his way out. The Topic Born To Die comes really into play when using those dead bodies as each of them comes to life to ultimately die again later in the run.</p>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Spooky Bodies has its origin in the alpha Winter Game Jam 2022. Its core theme is \"Born To Die\".\u00a0</p>\r\nGame Design\r\n<p>Maximilian Putz</p>\r\nTec Department\r\n<p>Richard Schubert<br/>Erik Hasenknopf<br/>Theo St\u00f6tzer</p>\r\nArt Department\r\n<p>Timur Friederici<br/>Anja Schmidt</p>\r\nSound Department\r\n<p>Leonard Bernd<br/>Trung Tran Quoc</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T07:01:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eab/eab864796df92f28a52abc03b2324359.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kuay", "hasenknopf", "Kiirou", "MrXamelax", "MarchTales", "Lyred"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
