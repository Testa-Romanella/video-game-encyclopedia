The game is more fun this way!</li></ul>\n<p>I had this game idea for two years. I was testing a prototype and abandoned it. After seeing the limitation given by Mini-Jam 101, I've decided to build a new game based on that old idea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 35 levels as of now.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n<p>People using mobile, can change their browsers to desktop mode and can play the game. Although you cannot use the \"Escape\" key functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Android:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Launch the Chrome browser on Android.</p>\n<p>2. Open any website that you want to view in desktop mode.</p>\n<p>3. Tap on. for the menu options.</p>\n<p>4. Select the checkbox against the Desktop site.</p>\n<p>5.
