But sometimes, you want to show a message on screen to the player and also let him keep moving.\r\n</p>\n<p>It can be a notification, a conversation cutscene, or just a window updating some text value.\r\n</p>\n<p>This plugin will help you with that, letting you create multiple windows on-screen on scene map and battle scene!\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Adds multiple text windows on the screen.\r\n</li><li>Text windows can be moved, opened, and closed with easing animations!\r\n</li><li>Write the text instantly, or character by character, like the default message window!\r\n</li><li>Play a sound to open/close the window!\r\n</li><li>Use faces or character sprite images to be the face of the message!\r\n</li><li>Create template settings for quick use inside the game!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><em>NOTE: MV Version has huge frame drops if you try to do something like the above. I believe it works on MZ due to the performance optimizations between versions, most for the PIXI updates. But you will be totally fine showing just a few windows at the same time.</em></p>\r\nHow to use\r\n<p>See here on google docs.</p>\r\nUpdate Log\r\nTerms of use 5.0.0", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T08:34:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56d/56df42260bb012af5f3a67991c5466a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hakuen Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
