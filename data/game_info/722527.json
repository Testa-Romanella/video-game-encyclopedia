Quickly get back before you completely decay!\u00a0This is a simple puzzle game where your movement gets more and more restricted the more you move around (as your limbs keep falling off!)</p>\n<p>This is a submission for the 3 day game jam Minijam 97:\u00a0Simulation. Total work hours came to a little under 20 hours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts on final project (as part of the game jam)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sadly this game wasn't as finished as I'd hoped. The major problem being that there isn't enough levels and content! There are only 8\u00a0levels (and two are tutorials) that don't really get hard enough. The core mechanics seem to show promise, but needed a little bit more complexity.\u00a0 I was however happy with the visuals (even if there was no animation) and general stability/playability of the things I did implement and create.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T10:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/523/52310a26b1558ff00a9d827365ea0604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monday's Lunch"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
