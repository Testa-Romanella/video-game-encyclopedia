I spend more than 1 month and a half to reproduce a project school game.</p>\n<p>It tells the story of a viking penguin which family was murdered by communists chickens so he decided to teleport to their base and kill a maximum of them. It's a simple shoot 'em all.<br/></p>\n<p>Some sound effects aren't that good but you can mute the game in the settings. All the keys are in the settings too.</p>\n<p>Thanks, TheRolf <br/>My Website : http://therolf.fr/ , my twitter @TheRolfFR<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d73a7ac8ded1db6e82fe672c1b15644b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheRolf"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
