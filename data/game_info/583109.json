The game is set in the fictional town of Burton Hollow, Rhode Island, USA. The player is a seasoned detective called to the town to investigate the dark forces that plague the town. Beware the horrors that may infest this most forsaken place as you journey deeper into Burton Hollow.</p>\n\n<p>It was just like any other day. The town was just beginning to wake up at the brink of dawn, everything was as it should be. People began to leave their homes, either to leave for work or to have some fun in this quiet little seaside town; but something unusual was afoot. A moving truck was seen on the main street traveling towards the suburbs, followed by four others all heading to the same street. The four people moving into those houses all arrived in the same nondescript white van, people approached to greet them but slowly turned away. There was something wrong with the newcomers to the town but no one could put their finger on it.\r\n</p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, the town\u2019s homely feeling shifted to an eerie unsettling feeling. People began to slowly disappear, one day it would be the old lady down the street, the next it would be your next-door neighbor. Places where people once lived would seemingly become overgrown with fauna overnight. Eventually, the town was left completely destitute, except for the last four people who had moved into the town just recently.\r\n</p>\n<p>Decades later and no one who ventures to Burton Hollow ever comes back alive, it has been wiped off of maps and left to slowly rot along with whatever had gone wrong with the town all those years ago. Now it is up to a lone detective by the name of Philip Ward to solve the case and restore the town to its original homely state. Will he succeed or will he fall like everyone else?\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T21:31:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c97/c9707f597fe136e70047c3feff8950b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patar63", "TallMills", "TheGinge", "juss2186", "aaron_ho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
