Fuel and oxygen\u00a0are very precious and limited; so using them up is quite the sacrifice!</p>\n<p>In Apollo you pilot a rocket ship through a field of debris, meteors and alien ships. You need to dodge these obstacles, however moving the rocket sacrifices your limited fuel supply! The goal is to last as long as possible without fuel or oxygen running out, or the ship taking too much damage.</p>\n<p>Meteors can crash into your ship, while alien ships will shoot lasers at you. Once you have taken damage, you will start to leak oxygen.</p>\n<p>The ship is in space, Newton's first law of motion applies:\u00a0there\u2019s no friction to slow it down automatically!\u00a0The game is over when the ship explodes, you suffocate to death or run out of fuel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use A/D or LEFT/RIGHT arrows to control the ship.</p>\n<p>This is my entry to Ludum Dare 43, where the theme was \"Sacrifices must be made\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T04:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cde1e274123d87c4e2b2177205f94911.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamie Buttenshaw"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
