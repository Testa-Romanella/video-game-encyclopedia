This is the first full game I've ever\u00a0completed (not including game jams).\u00a0 I started working one month ago and set a goal for myself to have it completed in a month. There were many instances where I had to go with 'good enough' because of time constraints. Still, I made the game in entirety and I'm proud.</p>\n\n<p>Please leave your feedback and constructive criticism.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/878/8780374b6316b6691e20ee0a3d117e64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Suess"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
