Collect your thought (bubbles) and avoid knock-out stars or you'll start over in this\u00a03 level demo.. What do you think? Should I keep it more traditional manga entirely in black and white, or is the enhanced\u00a0gameboy COLOR idea ok? The plot isn't fully fleshed out (it's just a demo) but depending on feedback could become full comic/game! Arrows to move, X to jump, Z to hide seen text.\u00a0Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:09:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08a/08acb2643c45504c79ddd9d2808ad73f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Game portal...."], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
