Mothers torn from daughters, fathers from sons, because they had dared to dream, because they had dared to think themselves worthy to approach the Lord.</p>\n<p>They had been cast down from the tower, from the Lord\u2019s grace, as one had been before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had been flaming as he fell. They rushed to their windows to watch the orange speck approach the horizon. The wind pushed back their hair upon his impact.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They grabbed their tools, wordlessly approaching the nameless heat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What they found was a crater. A great huge thing, half a mile wide. And the creature was gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They no longer needed words. They all had one thought as they began to dig.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the Lord will not listen to us, maybe the Devil will.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Action<br/>\r\n    Mouse &amp; keyboard\r\n    Controller\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Move\r\n    WASD\r\n    Left stick\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Look\r\n    Mouse\r\n    Right stick\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Sprint\r\n    Shift\r\n    Left trigger\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Crouch\r\n    Control\r\n    Right button\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Interact\r\n    Left mouse\r\n    Right bumper\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Throw\r\n    Right mouse\r\n    Left bumper\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Jump\r\n    Space\r\n    Bottom button\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Flashlight\r\n    F\r\n    Left button<br/>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Pause\r\n    Escape\r\n    Start", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T06:02:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/431886212d0f91a7182c4cbde25b12ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Figglewatts", "Fiona Sangster"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
