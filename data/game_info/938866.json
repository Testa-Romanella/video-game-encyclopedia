I'll be doing my best to get updated versions of the game out with more content. This is mostly serving as what the game will play like and is just for testing purposes.</p>\n<p>The game is going to be 100% free, any support is welcomed but not required. There\u00a0will be a story behind this game, but right now we are fleshing out the mechanics we plan to implement and working on the main levels.</p>\n<p>The U.I is bound to go through some changes, all feedback will help for future updates.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Feel free to join our studio! If you are playing this as a tester, let us know for an official tester role in our server! This is not the only project planned.</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/qdRccjF9BW<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T13:57:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc897c18348c0cb0c819a54989695c96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astanon Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
