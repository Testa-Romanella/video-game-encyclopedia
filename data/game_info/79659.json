It might be a small after-school club now, but with the right training, even the sky isn't the limit for this team!<br/><br/>Train players by assigning them practice drills. You choose what they need to focus on, such as batting or pitching.<br/><br/>Install batting cages, showers, or other facilities to make life better for the team. A good environment makes for more effective training! School life is not all about sports, though. Studying is just as important, so make sure to construct educational facilities to upgrade the school.<br/><br/>House students in a dorm and they'll have more time for both studying and baseball practice! Pick your best players for the team and test their skill at tournaments.<br/><br/>\u25bc Game Flow<br/>Turn your high school baseball team into real champions. Train players, add new facilities to the school and organize various activities for the team members.<br/><br/>\u25bc Upgrading the School<br/>The school can be upgraded in four departments: Study, Sports, Fun, and Nature. To level them up, construct new facilities and have students use them.<br/>The higher the level of each of these categories, the higher the baseball team budget and facility fees. You can also unlock new facilities when leveling up.<br/><br/>\u25bc Activities<br/>You can undertake various activities once each school term. Use them to upgrade the school's Study, Sports, Fun and Nature levels.<br/><br/>\u25bc Games<br/>The games are auto-played by the players. There are two spectator modes:<br/>1. Live<br/>2. Highlights<br/><br/>The number of innings in a game depends on its type. It's 6 innings for friendly practice games, and 9 for the real deal ones.<br/><br/><br/>Try searching for \"Kairosoft\" to see all of our games!!<br/><br/>Developer Homepages.
