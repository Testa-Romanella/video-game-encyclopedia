It is infinitely extensible by design, and has been built from the beginning with community driven modpacks in mind. The ultimate goal of this project is to push the limits of what is possible in a voxel-based environment, and to make that task as easy as possible on the end user. Currently, the game ships with a world editor, \"avatar\" mode, character designer, a wide array of block types - including electrical components that can be miniaturized into integrated circuits.</p><p>Feel free to follow me on tumblr for updates -\u00a0http://wolfgangmeyers.tumblr.com/</p><p>Have questions?
