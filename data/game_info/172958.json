Not because of the coding (which I picked up very easily) but attempting to make an interesting story out of this. I probably could've spent more time on this to make it really impressive, but I also want to continue with the course and start work on the few drawing courses I have to start adding my own assets to future prototypes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74cda2f9ddfa6773cca4d916b779a266.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Aron Marczylo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
