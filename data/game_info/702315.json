Collect loot to exchange for gear, leveling the heroes as they succeed in progressively harder expeditions to moving their caravan deeper into the Wilds.<br/><br/>Can you deliver them safely to their new home?<h3>Row Based Combat</h3><br/>Combat is a synthesis of turn based order with a row-based skill system. Your heroes each possess 6 unique skills that must be used cooperatively to overcome the myriad of monsters within the Untamed Wilds.<h3>Narrative Based On Relationship Scores</h3><br/>As party members fight alongside each other relationships develop playing out in an ongoing narrative. Will the party overcome their differences and develop the trust necessary to achieve their goal or will the caravan breakup part way through the expedition?<h3>Argument System</h3><br/>Each hero possesses an Argument meter that rises during fights. Be sure to monitor this score because if it gets too high they may refuse to help fight the monsters!<h3>Swap Party Members Between Encounters</h3><br/>The party can only have four active combatants so feel free to swap in healthier party members after a rough fight! If a hero gets knocked out during an expedition they will automatically revive once the party gets back to the Caravan.<h3>Unique Mini-boss and Boss Encounters</h3><br/>Each Biome possesses four mini-bosses and four unique bosses that must be overcome through the course of the caravan\u2019s travels. Learn the attack patterns of each and how to use your party\u2019s skills to overcome!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T03:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e9/9e903ad32d8690953377a6b47297d0ea.jpg", "website": "https://www.boomersworkshop.com/sanctuary-saga-prelude", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boomer's Workshop"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Boomer's Workshop"], "esrb_rating": null}
