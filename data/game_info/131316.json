They may not be very good at it, but that makes it more fun to watch! Play as any animal, each with differing control schemes, and battle the wind and melting ice while trying to stay in the rink. Show us that goats really can skate</p>\n<p>Move with WASD or the arrow keys. Use an animal's ability with shift or space.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!
