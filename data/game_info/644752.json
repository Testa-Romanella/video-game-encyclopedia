Maybe not even a game, but rather a digital toy. It was created by a single developer (hi that\u2019s me, Paul) to scratch a very specific itch. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The Ramp captures the unparalleled feeling of real life vert skateboarding and that\u2019s pretty much it. There is a lot this game doesn\u2019t feature. <strong>What it offers you are the 15 minutes of flow that make a boring day great, at the price of a medium sized cinnamon pistachio latte to go.</strong><br/><br/>Please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch if you have feedback, questions or problems with the game. I\u2019ll do my best to get back to you as quickly as possible. Also let me know if you enjoyed The Ramp, because that really makes my day!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T13:50:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/5418738decb6c1a343a86c39d212c541_IApqwon.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 214, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 10}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Crescent Moon Games", "hyperparadise"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crescent Moon Games", "Hyperparadise"], "esrb_rating": null}
