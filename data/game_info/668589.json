Evil monsters are killing the pumpkins, save them by bringing them into a safe farm at the day and defend the ones which are outside from the enemies. To catch the pumpkins at the day, you have to freeze them with the help of the wand you have and then collect them and bring them to the farm. But remember! While freezing the pumpkins, they will run away from you. If they run too much they will get rotten and become enemy at night! So try not to make them run much.</p>\n<p>After saving 25 pumpkins a key will pop infront of the farm. You can take that and go in-front of the gate of the \"Graveyard\", where the boss lives. Then you have to defeat him in order to make the forest safe!</p>\n<p>GOOD LUCK!</p>\r\nCREDITS-\r\n\n<p>-Design team-\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lead Designer: Brugon\u00a0</p>\n<p>Designer: Infiniverse\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Art team-\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lead artist: Kniilz\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Programmer team-\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer: Jes\u00fas Cant\u00fa - NightDragonC\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programmer: Infiniverse</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0Marllon Silva (xDeviruchi).</p>\r\nPREMADE ASSETS USED-\r\n<p>Magic Spell -\u00a0https://stealthix.itch.io/animated-fires</p>\n\r\nThanks!\r\nImportant - Please use the downloadable version for a better experience as WebGL version is causing wierd UI scaling", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T07:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bc/8bcefe519f6607736b20ae7aee5bd47a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Infiniverse Studios", "ChuyCantu", "Brugon", "kiinii"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
