Central gameplay (and musical) concepts failed to fire properly for this project, but it has a functioning game loop, so we are uploading it.<br/><br/>Move the drone target with the arrow keys. Press space to drop a bomb from a drone. Press shift to summon a new drone. Try to use the bombs to destroy all the turrets on each train car. Press A and D to move the truck.</p>\n<p>Gun turrets will shoot at your drones, unless there are no drones left, in which case they will shoot at the truck. Mortar turrets will always shoot at the truck directly - watch out for them. If the truck is hit, it's game over.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T19:39:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/273/27396462bd890ccea6da4ed752095370.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fusipon", "Ruruie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
