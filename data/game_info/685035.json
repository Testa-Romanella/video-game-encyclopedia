It comes with a <strong>Shapes </strong>theme and a <strong>Fruits </strong>theme (collections of images)<br/><ul><li> There are additional <strong>Down Loadable Content</strong> themes available and many more coming (all very inexpensive)<br/>The game has 3 button selectable difficulty levels (easy, medium, triplets).<br/><ul><li> There are rows of images, 6 images per row (so 3 rows for easy yields 3*6=18 image locations), but the images are 'covered' when play begins<br/></li><li> Every play is different, the hidden image locations are randomly generated each time<br/></li><li> The player clicks a pair of covered images to uncover them and see if they match.  If they do not, they are covered again.<br/></li><li> The player clicks a different pair to see what they are, and eventually discovers an image that matches a previous image<br/></li><li> Now knowing the locations of a pair of matching images, the player clicks them and they stay uncovered.<br/></li><li> The player repeats this process, remembering the location of new images, until all pairs are matched and uncovered<br/></li><li> The game shows the players time, as well as the previous best time for that difficulty level<br/></li><li> When players win and gain confidence, they can change the game to medium(5 rows yields 5*6=30 image locations)<br/></li><li> When players become very confident, they can change to triplets of matching images (6 rows yields 6*6=36 image locations)</li></ul><br/>Since the score is based on fast times, it works best using a <strong>mouse </strong>to easily click squares.<br/><ul><li> you can also just relax and click, playing for fun and ignoring time<br/></li><li> it is suitable for everyone, from children to seniors.  Truly <strong>Family-Friendly</strong></li></ul><br/>The initial base-game has a <strong>Shapes</strong> and a <strong>Fruits</strong> themes, but we have several up-coming downloads (all inexpensive) with other themes.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T04:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbb/cbb7222e562c2908256560eb7ddf8ba1.jpg", "website": "https://RestlessSwords.com/lost-pairs", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Restless Swords"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Restless Swords Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
