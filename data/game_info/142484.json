I\u00a0just discovered the Flick Game tool a week ago, and I\u00a0thought I\u00a0could execute my concept on a very modest, yet still effective scale.</p>\n<p>The Flick Game tool has a lot of limitations, which made this project fun to conceptualize. You are limited to only 16 slides, which means stories have to be very tightly constructed. As a result, this is a story that you can finish in 30-60 seconds, depending on how long you want to admire my glorious art work.</p>\n<p>Check out the Flick Game tool at https://www.flickgame.org/.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play the Game:</strong></p>\n<p>Certain colors on each screen are clickable. Once players click on them, the story advances.</p><p>More from this developer:\u00a0https://johnvanderhoef.itch.io<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b15fcc18f31938cb89b44e8392454b81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John Vanderhoef"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
