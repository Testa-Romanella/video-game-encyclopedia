Both of which will kill you in 1 blow.</p>\n<p>The crabs are pretty violent as well as very much vulnerable. If it finds you , it will chase and kill you in 1 hit but if you are lucky enough to fire a bullet through it before it reaches you,\u00a0it dies. Use your bullet wisely, don't waste it.</p>\n<p>This Game is a broader version of minesweeper with fps and 3d.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Shift + WASD - Run</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Mouse - Pan camera</p>\n<p>M - Open/close mini-map</p>\n<p>R - Restart level</p>\n<p>Left Click - Shoot</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Ashwin -\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/crimsonash07</p>\n<p>Fasith -\u00a0https://fasith.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Swathik - </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T06:01:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/653d051d75208ea2baa195467347a39c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fasith"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
