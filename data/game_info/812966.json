You received an F on your math test. Now you must run for your life, as she chases you trying to give you a whooping. But as you run around, littles clues and notes you find lead you to uncover the dark truth about your family. Find your way out before it's too late, and DON'T GET WHOOPED!!! This game is in very early development, and I just need some feedback on gameplay so far and any bugs or lag issues. The game is not winnable at this moment, and doesn't even have a menu screen. Just let me know in the comments any problems with lag, specifically in the cursor looking.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T14:18:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cf/5cfbf7043eb49a528e34f552998163ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BATMAN_037"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
