The story is about the journey of a person making a game.</p>\n<p>Besides the explosion animation and bullets are from the itch asset store, everything is made by me (including the music, some pixel arts). It's a short game, hope you can get what the story is about.</p>\n<p>I really enjoy making it; Hope you enjoy playing it, and thanks for playing my game :)</p><p>Oh, and feel free to comment and give all your ideas about this, thank you a lot!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:16:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0b/c0bda01cd2b3cdf5024e7cd688552633.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZEKA_G"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
