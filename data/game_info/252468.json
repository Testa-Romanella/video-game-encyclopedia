The player can move one ball per turn, and the player may only move a ball to a particular place if there is a path between the current position of the ball and the desired destination. After your turn, three more balls are dropped onto the field. Thus, every next move is going to be more and more difficult! The goal is to remove balls by forming lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of at least five balls of the same color. If the result of a move has made a line disappear, the next portion of balls will not appear immediately. The goal is to reach the maximum score. Points are given every time you manage to remove some balls from the field.<br/>With this educational game you can improve concentration, logical thinking and pattern matching skills.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/064/0641e8959715ab50eb90a6da9de45aab_9yq6Hqw.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Devarai"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Henning Dierolf"], "esrb_rating": null}
