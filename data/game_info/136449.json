Going with that theme, I essentially cloned a quick and dirty version of  the \"I love hue\" app in 90 minutes and went with it.  Obviously not something I'm sending to the app store, but an example of how quickly work can be done with corona sdk.  The point of the game is to get the colored blocks in order.  The game will continually get harder and harder after completing each level, with more pieces being shifted and moved for the player to put back in place.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2c3dec57c19c475df79f267523d9287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["purplesour2000"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
