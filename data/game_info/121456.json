My keyboard is terrible and I barely do any testing with it (except for inputting debug commands and making sure they actually do things), so the default keyboard controls are pretty bad.</p>\n<p>Things that I can remember that changed from DDXX:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imported [Blue], Blue is a more technical character compared to [Red]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Imported [Elemental Earth], the first boss for [Blue] (Slightly Janky at the moment)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modified state changes for the player character, so theoretically controls should be a bit smoother<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Partially Imported the Title Screen<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fixed a bug where enemies would sometimes ignore hitbox launch properties</p>\n<p>It's like the DD16 version except somehow with less features.<br/>Currenty the controls can't be rebound. I have to figure it out again as Godot 3 is a bit different compared to 2.1.4 and I ran outta time.</p>\n<p>*While I can export this to Mac/Linux, I currently don't have a good way of testing those. If you are using those OS and don't mind it being completely untested, just ask.<br/>///////////////////////Default Controls - Gamepad<br/>//360 [Mysterious other controller]<br/>[Red]<br/>Jump - A [X]<br/>Attack(Basic) - X [Square]<br/>Attack(Strong) - Y[Triangle]<br/>Dash - RB [R1]<br/>Pause/Menu - Start [Start]<br/>Daijoubu - RS [R3]</p>\n<p>[Blue]<br/>Jump - A [X]<br/>Attack(Physical) - X [Square]<br/>Attack(Magic) - Y[Triangle]<br/>Right Dash - RB [R1]<br/>Left Dash - LB [L1]<br/>Pause/Menu - Start [Start]<br/>Daijoubu - RS [R3]</p>\n<p>//Temp How to Do things<br/>Usually you can do a different move by pressing one of the attack buttons + a direction; (Left/Right + attack is the same as pressing no direction + attack)<br/>The bar below the Green HP bar is for the Strong/Magic attacks</p>\n<p>[Blue] moveset somewhat explained:<br/>Magic + No direction/Left/Right - A basic 3 hit attack, does multiple hits and gets stronger with more hits<br/>Magic + Down - Ice hocky puck. Can be hit to move around. Has negative launching properites on explosion (so an enemy in the air will fall downwards). After exploding, it leaves a small AoE that does tick damage for a while until it disappears<br/>Magic + Up - Hold the magic button to increase the distance of this attack. Has launching properties. Will try to force itself to the ground</p>\n<p>Physical/Basic Attacks Restore the MP bar (For both characters)</p>\n<p>[Blue] is able to wall jump by holding a direction towards a wall (to go into wallhug) and then pressing the jump button.
