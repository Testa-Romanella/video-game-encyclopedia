{"id": 170711, "slug": "the-island-crialex", "name": "The Island (Crialex)", "name_original": "The Island (Crialex)", "description": "<p>First of all, the technology we used for this game is approx. 30 years old (it was made around 1980, Borland Pascal 7.0). Us from Crialex wanted to prove that even though that technology is very old, it can still do wonders in the right hands. Having two basic commands to work with: putpixel and line, without being able to use images/image editors whatsoever (like GIMP, Photoshop or MS Paint), we made everything that can be seen in the game pixel by pixel. Even though the game is small, it spans on over 19.000 lines of code, written in approximately 4-5 months by us. Also, the game has only 16 colors.</p><p>This game is a survival simulator inspired from Stranded 2 where you are a young man on an island that must survive, eat, drink, build and craft various items and buildings to survive. The game has tens of buildings and crafting recipes, and various maps. It even has a map and texture creator/editor.</p><p>Originally, this game was in Romanian and it only worked on 32x bit versions of Windows. Now, we translated the game completely and we've used the DosBox Portable version to make it a standalone exe that can run all the editors and the game itself on any version of Windows by just a double click on the exe. Note that you MUST read the readme that's contained in the download with the install instructions (which really consists of 1 step, where to place the game folder).</p><p>The only thing that is not translated is the logo. That took about two days to draw, pixel by pixel, and it's a lot of work to redraw it, considering the logo doesn't have much of an impact, really.</p><p>Keys to move in the menu: W,A,S,D. From here on, the game keys are in the help menu of the game, where the gameplay is also explained (hunting, fishing, mining, crafting, etc.). Also, Alt+Enter enters Fullscreen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/895e6354170a01fcdc906e6a471306dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crialex"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
