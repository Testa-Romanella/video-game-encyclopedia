Larger transports such as trains and cars went first. Smaller vehicles like bicycles are still around, though they, too are collapsing. You must use one bicycle to escape, collect enough scrap to build and upgrade a new one and keep going, until you reach the coast and a wooden ship. Without a vehicle you stand no chance as the the cloud of rust will catch up to you and corrode the iron in your blood...</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use mouse in main menu and workshop, and keyboard (WASD or Arrow Keys)\u00a0on the road. M to Mute/Unmute, ESC to return to <em>lose progress</em> and return to Main Menu.</p>\n<p>You have no permanent upgrades - they're only for the newest bicycle, which will corrode away when you reach the next workshop.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><strong>Other info:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made for\u00a0Construct 3 Builder Jam #2. The theme of the jam was \"Lifecycle\". The theme is present in the game in three ways:\u00a01. As wordplay - you cycle for your life. 2. Each bicycle has a lifecycle during which you must collect enough scrap to build a new one. 3. Recycle - you recycle bits of scrap at the end of their lifecycle to re-use them.</p>\n<p>Game Engine:\u00a0Construct 3</p>\n<p>Graphics Software: Aseprite</p>\n<p>Music Software:\u00a0Reaper</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T02:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f1/2f1aa574a4e6eb80a321dff7f0eacc4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jorava"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
