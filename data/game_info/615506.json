As the title implies, it's a virtual terrarium set up to care for a pogona lizard, more commonly known as bearded dragons. The game features some customization options for your terrarium, as well as the color morph of your bearded dragon, which is a simple AI that wanders the tank and drinks periodically, as well as eats the cricket you can drop into the tank. I've also included an infographic with some educational text\u00a0about bearded dragons.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was built with Unity's HDRP and as such may take a fairly beefy rig to run at max fps, however with a scalable window making it smaller will help with performance. I do want to come back to the project and add a less graphically demanding version for low-spec devices and web players, but for now I'm going to call this finished, as it was mainly just for fun.<br/><br/>The music used can be found here:https://youtu.be/QQMjZxIipbE</p>\n<br/>And the ambient track used in the background here:https://youtu.be/tnOj-DsZKsU<br/><br/>If you want to see more of my work you can visit my website here:\u00a0https://www.loganchitwoodillustration.com/<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T06:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8be/8be4f6f36c00b7271e25547574938e22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LoganChitwood"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
