The Knight &amp; the Princess are stronger together! Which the theme was stronger together. You control both characters trying to survive waves of these vampire creatures. The knight can attack but the princess can not! Keep both alive until the timer runs out! Use Tab to switch between them! The knight provides 3 extra health to the princess and the princess provides double the damage. Depending on who is in who's circle and who's active at the time. Please enjoy, I made this last minute so it's not my best work I swear!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:11:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ed/8ed52ce38823487ba1d00671e916f4cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ArturPrograms"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
