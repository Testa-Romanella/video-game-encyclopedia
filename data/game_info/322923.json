You even gave away your arm to become stronger. Just when you thought you can't get any stronger, you heard of the being called The Undeadking, with your power to absorb the strength of fallen foes you make your way into his castle.<br/></p>\n<p>Since the game is still in progress there will be a lot of bugs.
