This is an old project from a few years ago that did not see much time after completion.<br/><br/>You play as a musician named Tom, he arrives at a house and must find a way out. The gameplay consists of having to find items inside and outside the house all whilst there are only ever 4 directions to go. North, East, South and West. The game does have some bugs but is fully playable.</p>\n<p>The entire project is available and is fully Open-Source. Feel free to edit it, change it up, even use it to help you learn some of the basics of C++. <br/><br/>The download comes with the C++ project along with a full exe build. There is a joke when the user presses 4 on the menu.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T07:53:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b0/7b039cade3d7820f159a12acddbc9ba8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KLewis"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
