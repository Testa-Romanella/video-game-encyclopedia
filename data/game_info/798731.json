If you go off the continental shelf into deeper wate, you are in danger of sea monsters. This is a game about sea monsters attacking people off the continental shelf.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Audio:\u00a0</strong>Optional wave sounds and attack sounds. I like controlling sounds so I added options to toggle those on and off. I generated the attack sounds specially for this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:\u00a0</strong>Click buttons with timing! Eat people! Make them run away fast, screaming!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Visuals</strong>: Colorful marshmallow people. Chompy sea monsters. Nice water. Nice sand.\u00a0I'm happy with the chomping. Chomp chomp. Chomp rarrrgh chomp.</p>\n<p><strong>Enjoyment</strong>: I\u00a0hope you enjoy. I hope you smirk a little at the concept, at least. Maybe exhale from your nose at the antics of the local sea monster breakfast club.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls (Desktop Only, No Mobile):</strong></p><p>First use \"Distract\" button -- this lures people out to see the wonderful wildlife, like friendly dolphins.</p>\n<p>Then use \"Attack\" button -- there are three locations you can attack at, based on which button you click. Wait until the people are right above the word \"attack\"\u00a0to make sure you get them!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hello Person Still Reading,:</strong></p>\n<p>I have a cat on my lap.</p>\n<p>Made for Trijam #172: Off the Shelf.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I no longer have a cat on my lap.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T14:42:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/067/06755f68bc7d69d64fac115d0aa11ccc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["the_nope_slope"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
