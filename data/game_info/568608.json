Melted, distorted, but an impressive facsimile, nonetheless. This place has always predated the factory, but it has adopted much of its form. It may likely remain still even once the factory is entirely gone.\r\nA Twisted Place is a dark linear horror interactive fiction with themes of self-worth and suicide, with photographic environmental art taken at the abandoned Bradmill factory site.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:41:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15d/15dec2c4df2a67db88bdb7867c281224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rana Strange"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
