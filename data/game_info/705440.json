Let me know if you find any bugs!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/><br/>A (Z key)\u00a0: Select/Drop Corner, Roll Die<br/>Start (Enter key): Finish your turn<br/>Arrows to move cursor<br/><br/>First, roll the die! You must move that number of spaces (with one or both corners).\u00a0Earn points for the area you cover between your two corners, but only if the area is divisibly by your die roll. Points are deducted for overlap between players.
