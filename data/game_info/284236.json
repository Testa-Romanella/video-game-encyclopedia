Sprouts grow and disappear over time, allowing for live melodies to be played over each loop. Trees play the same notes as sprouts, but do not disappear. Mushrooms play a randomized pitch each time to add variety to the melody. To tie everything together, Cacti create drum beats. Change the atmosphere of your planet and adjust the BPM by tapping or dragging the slider at the top of the screen.<br/><br/>There are 12 sprout colors and 12 cactus colors to choose from, for an endless variety of loops that grow and change as you play.<br/><br/>Note: Planetone depends on device performance to maintain a constant speed, so older devices may experience hiccups while playing. To avoid this, try using a slower BPM.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:40:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd277c1842e8543b36725ac1229f8618_GltVjB3.jpg", "website": "http://shilly.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Michael Shillingburg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Michael Shillingburg"], "esrb_rating": null}
