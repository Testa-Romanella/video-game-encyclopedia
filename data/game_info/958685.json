In this game, you will be responsible for managing life on a flat earth that was created after a meteor hit the earth we know today.</p>\n<p>Life on the flat earth was almost extinct, leaving only small sea creatures to repopulate the planet through their evolution. It is up to you to manage these sea creatures, help them develop, and create a new ecosystem so that life can flourish again.</p>\n<p>In addition to managing life on the flat earth, the player will also have to worry about managing the available resources. This includes natural resources such as water, food, and minerals, which will need to be explored conscientiously and sustainably to ensure the balance of the ecosystem. The player will also need to manage the money that the inhabitants of the flat earth may have.</p>\n<p>Over time, the player will have to make important decisions about how to invest the available resources, balancing development needs with the limitations imposed by the environment.</p>\n<p>The goal of 'The Flat Earth' is to develop life to the highest possible level. The game ends if life becomes extinct, resulting in the player's defeat. But if there is developed life and the age of the earth reaches 10 million years A.M. (After the Meteor), the player wins the game.<br/><br/><strong>This game was designed for the Game Mockup Jam and is unavailable for playing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The mockup was conceived under the CC BY 4.0 license.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T19:41:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/337/337d0e7d0f94e3f1169822fd524f9376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HS Studio \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
