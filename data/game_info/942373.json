Hitch a ride as Mr. Mops and outfit Bot\u2019s new getup as you see fit for battle with the space station\u2019s cranky, ancient CRT.<br/><br/>Using Shield consumes your power cell energy if you don\u2019t select infinite shield. There is a chance the boss\u2019 weak-points will spawn extra cells.</p>\n<strong>Please use the modifications to best fit your ability and desired challenge.</strong>\n<p><strong>Known Bug:</strong><br/>There is a very slim chance you\u2019ll hit a bug that halts the game \u2026 the good/bad news is it only happens if you die while the chasing bullet is out (it\u2019s rare, but can happen). You were dead anyway, I guess! Give it another try. You\u2019ll get that S rank no problem. I found it after submission. Took two minutes to fix, so I will update this page with the new build as soon as ratings for the jam are over.</p>\r\nKEYBOARD CONTROLS\r\n<strong>Move</strong>WASD or Arrow Keys<strong>Shoot</strong>J or C, you can hold for continuous fire.\u00a0<strong>Dash</strong>K or X and a directional input.\u00a0<strong>Shield</strong>L or Z \u2014 uses your energy cells for power.<strong>Menu</strong>Mouse to select modifications or menu options.\r\nGAMEPAD CONTROLS\r\n<strong>Move</strong>\r\nD-Pad or Left Analog Stick<strong>Shoot</strong>\r\nWest Button - you can hold for continuous fire.\u00a0<strong>Dash</strong>\r\nSouth Button and a directional input.\u00a0<strong>Shield</strong>\r\nNorth Button \u2014 uses your energy cells for power.<strong>Menu</strong>\r\nMouse \u2026 sorry to make you switch back and forth.\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>Hold Shift and press R</strong>\u00a0| Restart Game\r\n</p>\n<p>Made for GDKO, a game jam tournament hosted by\u00a0Xanderwood.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Round 3 Task:\u00a0Create a Boss Fight.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS\u00a0</strong>- All art, code and concept by MF of Endmark Games (music made using Ecrett Music). - Kenney Blocks font and Kenney Mini font from\u00a0Kenney. - Adjusted version of the Famicube\u00a0Palette by\u00a0Arne\u00a0on Lospec.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks to my wife, AirBear, for supporting me during round three!</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Huge thanks to\u00a0Xanderwood\u00a0for hosting.\u00a0</strong>\u00a0Grateful\u00a0for the inspiration and education from folks like Shaun Spalding, Benjamin Anderson, Aaron Craig, Slynyrd, Pixel Pete, AdamCYounis, Vimlark, Jonas Tyroller, DevDuck, Brandon James Greer, and the YoYo Games Community.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T15:39:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a86/a86d98c4c55768a7a9d8a02bdf9b5074.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EndmarkGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
