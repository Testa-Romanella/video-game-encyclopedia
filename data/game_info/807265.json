The only other person there says he knows what's going on, but warns you to be ready first.\u00a0Will you find a way home and learn the truth about yourself, or will you stay trapped here forever...?</p>\n<p>Features</p>\n<ul><li>Small open world</li><li>A unified interaction system; use any action on any interactable entity</li><li>Craft any existing recipe with any combination of materials (There's only one recipe right now...)</li><li>Hybrid action and turn-based combat</li><li>Simple branching storyline (two paths in this demo)</li></ul>\n\n<p>Be aware that this is a <strong><em>minimum viable product</em></strong> or proof of concept. I've mainly been working on the systems and have focused less on the art and content. I plan to spend a lot more time on the art and content now that I have this foundation to build on.</p>\n<p>Some features planned for the full release (not in the demo):</p>\n<ul><li>Storyline organized into three episodes\u00a0<ul><li>Each one takes place\u00a0in a separate world\u00a0</li><li>Each one has multiple endings</li><li>They advance in real-time, without waiting for you to act like traditional RPGs; if you want a certain ending, you'll have to overcome challenges at specific\u00a0times</li></ul></li><li>Each world is procedurally generated, with a small selection out of the possible biomes each time, increasing replayability</li><li>Everything will have a reaction to most actions and even to certain items, providing a reason to experiment</li><li>Different weapons and materials will have different attack speeds, and enemies will try to dodge your attacks. Strike when the enemy is at a pause in its movements</li><li>Unlike in this demo, battles will take place in the overworld. Use the scenery to block enemy attacks, or place walls of your own before battle for an advantage!</li><li>More materials and crafting recipes...! (Of course)</li><li>Emotional, mysterious, slightly surreal story about alternate realities</li></ul>\n<p>You can follow me on Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/floriankeystudios/ I plan to post updates on my progress regularly. I'll also probably branch out to other social media platforms in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T09:05:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8f/b8f3910a27fe36ebb7f159505848d0f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Florian Key"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
