Defend your base from mysterious aliens\u00a0who attack the musical dimension known as T<strong>he Grid</strong>.</p>\n<p>Visit the\u00a0Beat Defense Web page for more information as well!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Beat Defense is a game we envisioned as the love-child of rhythm games and tower defense games. Defend a base from enemies while your towers shoot musical and rhythmical bullets at your enemies. All towers in the game have a musical function, such as the bass, kick or melody tower! Build up and interact with the soundtrack by placing\u00a0 and upgrading your defensive towers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently there are 3 levels available in this prototype version.</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>The music is a heavy gameplay element in this game, not simply a background track, but the music is actually created and transforms as you build your towers. A melody tower will play perfectly in sync with the snare-drum tower on the other end of the field. Harmonies and rhythms flow seamlessly in this unique and never-before done musical interactive game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nRunic Sounds \u00b7 Beat Defense V0.1 - Main Menu\r\n\r\nRunic Sounds \u00b7 Beat Defense V0.1 - Score Screen\r\nProject Future\r\n<p>We are currently in the prototype phase of the project.
