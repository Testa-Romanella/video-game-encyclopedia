Currently, there are <strong>2 days</strong> in the game, on the evening of the second day, the text output will stop and not continue, this means that this is the end of current content.</p>\n<p>The engine is quite flexible and can be extended for easy modding, if there is going to be a demand for it.<br/></p>\n<p>Please share what you think about it, this is my first serious attempt at writing :) This is also my first attempt at pixel art, if you're an artist or a writer and you'd like to contribute, please do say. The game will also feature simple images to describe the environment in the terminal mode, but I need some time to cover all the locations.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>MacOS note:</strong> due to peculiarities of OpenGL on Mac OS, the shaders will probably not work and the walking part will look too bright, this is a known problem. The MacOS version is <em>untested</em> and might not work at all.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Also note that currently, the game can only run on a 1280x1024 resolution (in a window), so a screen of at least this size is adviced.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>In text mode, use number keys to select answers. Press 1 while the text is printing to show the whole thing at once. When asked to input text, input it with the keyboard.</p>\n<p>In walking mode, use A and D to go left and right, and E to interact.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:29:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c9/1c93986822166c0b511f334ba7107694.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["vaartis"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
