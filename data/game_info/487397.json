It contains 2 episodes, each with 4 levels. The goal is simple, get to the exit of each level. There are many enemies and traps that will attempt to prevent you from reaching the exit. Keys can be obtained and used to open locked doors. There are 4 different weapons to find, some of them are quite hidden though. <br/></p>\n<p>There is a survival mode as well. Kill as many enemies as possible to obtain points through a combo system. No online leaderboards exist but you can always try to top your own score or compete here in the comments. <br/></p>\n<p>This project was made in 2012 and originally tested on Windows Vista. Although my tests show it working just fine in Windows 10, be aware that it's old and some compatibility problems may arise. Post a comment if you encounter any trouble and I'll see if I can come up with a solution. The source to this project was lost long ago.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: <br/></p>\n<p>F4 - FULLSCREEN<br/>F10 - TOGGLE MOUSE<br/>ESC - TITLE SCREEN</p>\n<p>SHIFT - SHOOT<br/>CTRL - CHECK/OPEN<br/>LEFT MOUSE - SHOOT<br/>RIGHT MOUSE - CHECK</p>\n<p>ARROW KEYS - MOVE/TURN<br/>W,A,S,D - MOVE<br/>ENTER - PAUSE</p>\n<p>DIGITS - WEAPON TOGGLE</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>All design, programming and sounds by DEATH.</p>\n<p>Music by 64Mega<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T04:55:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e3/4e3b1774fde3d9cfb8cb2255933f0f48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DEATH"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
