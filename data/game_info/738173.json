I thought I would be scrounging for time due to the more expansive nature of the game, but time didn't turn out to be a real issue at all! I also severely underestimated how small a 84x48 resolution is, so that was probably the most restrictive part of this whole game. I have some experience with 1-bit monochromatic color pallets, so that wasn't a huge issue.\u00a0Anyways, I'm so happy with the way it turned out, and I hope you enjoy playing it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Skript-Kitty</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T03:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b86ceb2b423261e4f1c6ede570003021.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skript-Kitty"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
