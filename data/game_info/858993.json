Two dots, one field, and a whole lot of pinging and blasting.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to eliminate as many targets as possible before you are destroyed. Shoot enemy bullets to increase your modifier and snag powerups to waste your opponent.</p>\n<p>But be warned, your opponent is watching your moves closely, and you may find them mirroring you into a deadly corner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T15:36:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aadb3422bbd502836cb6dcb6fd648f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["brobot9000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
