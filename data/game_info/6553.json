Race in a city, country, and Egypt location.  In the country you will have to tackle huge ramps, loops, massive jumps, bridges, treacherous cliffs and much more.  Use hidden mine shaft entrances for shortcuts or alternate routes.<br/><br/>The country levels are a relaxing stroll in the park compared to the Egypt levels.  In Egypt you will have an ancient shield pursuing you through all the levels over ancient columns and pyramids.  If the shield hits you, you&amp;#39;ll be violently ripped off your motorcycle and have to restart the level.  You will have to decide if you want to outrun the shield or find a hiding spot and let it pass, but remember the clocks ticking.<br/><br/>In the city levels you will have to jump over cars and take on huge ramps and jumps, run over stray dogs and tons more.
