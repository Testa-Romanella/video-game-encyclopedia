Currently the game is <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> barebones and only includes features that are required for the game to be functional enough to actually play.<br/></p>\n<p>Considering this is my first game, it has various <strong>MAJOR</strong> flaws in its code structure, scene structure and game design. I'm not sure if i'll continue with this specific version as a result of this!</p>\n\n<p>Huge thanks to <strong>Nekso</strong> for providing the awesome pixel art, it would look a whole <strong>LOT</strong> worse if it would've been left to me :3<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Nekso18 - Art</p>\n<p>Kenney Assets - Font and some SFX</p>\n<p>arcticnoah\u00a0- Everything else :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/9424a314b7b2cccd81e9131da9bdb1b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["arcticnoah"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
