This is the latest version of that simulator, implemented in flash. I'm not much into actionscript programming these days, so I don't plan on adding any more features, but have posted it here for public access. Current features include:</p><p>Several particle types with different behaviors including water, ice, steam, fire, torch, moss.</p><p>Save/load of worlds using local flash storage.</p><p>Drag and drop regions to create multiple reusable clipboard objects.</p><p>Heat transfer between particles and with the world - you can boil the ocean, or create a frozen wasteland! Water your plants to make them grow, or set them on fire and watch them burn!</p><p>If you think this is cool, you should check out\u00a0Zandvox - a unity-based, 3 dimensional simulator that is based on the same concept.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wolfgangmeyers"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
