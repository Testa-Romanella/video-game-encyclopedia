She plays a game where she tries to catch the snow with the falling leaves of the trees. It can never last forever, but it keeps her mind busy.</p>\n<p>Press left and right (or A and D) to control the wind and move the leaves so that the snow melts on their warm surfaces before reaching the ground. Drag the mouse from one leaf to another so that they may connect. Connected leaves are wider, fall slower, and catch the wind much faster (at a maximum of four connected leaves).</p><p>This marks my first released project created in Godot.
