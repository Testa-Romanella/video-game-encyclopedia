Instead of dying and summoning the god intended, you find yourself face to face with an ancient being that was chained and locked away for the horrors they once committed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They make you an offer. Become their host and allow them a taste of freedom and they will grant you power to ensure you\u00a0<strong>both</strong>\u00a0<strong>live</strong>.\u00a0The catch is that their thoughts will become your thoughts, their weaknesses will become your weaknesses and their fears will become your fears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But things are never as simple as they seem. After the revelation that you are more than just human,\u00a0The Court of Night\u00a0decides to utilise the mistake they made by brainwashing you and shape you into something of their own that most would come to know simply as The Vessel\u2014someone who no one wishes to see at their doorstep.</p>\n<p>After being sent out to hunt down a traitor of The Court of Night, a series of unfortunate events sends you off the intended path and onto another where you then find yourself fighting an evil greater than the ones you were taught.</p>\n<p>RO appearances are on the intro post.</p>\n\n<p>Your former partner and the traitor of The Court. Before they burned the bridges between you, they were kind and understanding, even a bit protective, though, it is unknown whether everything you have been through together has been just an act.</p>\n<p>There is a storm that rages behind their eyes, fury, and hatred burning within. But when they look at you, the storm begins to settle and is replaced by guilt and regret.</p>\n\n<p>The jaded marksman. Vira has the sharpest eye Providence has to offer. The events of the past have led her to build a wall of safety around her, but there is a crack in that wall created by the few people she trusts and it is a crack that could be easily exploited if you so wished.</p>\n<p>She is cold to the touch, much like her personality. She doesn't trust you. She can't. She can't let that crack in her wall\u00a0become any bigger.</p>\n\n<p>The younger brother of Vira (by three minutes). Aurius has refined mastery of all blades, though his most preferred weapon is a sword gifted to him by a dear friend. Unlike his sister, Aurius exude an air of warmth, often gracing people with a gentle smile and listening with an open ear.</p>\n<p>He's protective of those he cares for. There is nothing he won't do for them. Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>The walker of shadows. Rhian is an expert in stealth, often making their way through conflict quietly without being seen or heard. But when they are out of the shadows, they tend to be charismatic and a bit flirty, though they want, they could be just as serious as the jaded marksman.</p>\n<p>They can be seen as the complete opposite when on a mission, something that often throughs people off when they find out that Rhian is one of the stealthiest there is in Providence.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Play as a female, male or non-binary character and customise your Vessel.</li><li>Romance one of four ROs.</li><li>Reluctantly join forces with The Order of Solitar and save the future from reigning chaos or join them simply to save yourself.</li><li>Reunite with people you never thought you'd see again.
