Partly because we were just too young and \u201cgreen\u201d back then, partly because, you know, \u201clife happens\u201d\u2026 we drifted apart, started our professional jobs and other ventures. You know, we grew up.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, after more than 25 years, we found all them early unfinished DOS versions, maps, concept art and documentation lying on old disks collecting dust. We also found a lot of sketches and ideas on paper (that miraculously survived the 25+ years).\n<br/>\nAnd so the decision was made - it\u2019s time to develop this thing.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are still determined that Mystic Land will be the best old-school computer fantasy role playing game with all the goodies from the 90s like turn based grid movement and combat, lots of (meaningful) skills and attributes and (hard) puzzled to solve.\n<br/>\nSaying that, we will also add some quality-of-life improvements like full controller/mouse/keyboard support and easier inventory and battle strategy management.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-24T08:04:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe0/fe014e10dfdd1558f14a57649cd0f891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MegaVision Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["MegaVision Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
