The theme was \"School Bus\" and we had a week.(I was lazy and only worked on the weekend a bit)</p>\n<p>The controls are far from perfect and are designed to be played with a HOTAS of some kind. (I had an old pair of Saitek x45s kicking around) and as everyone knows school buses are precision machines that demand the highest level of control that only a flight stick can offer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're not playing with a flight stick you'll defiantly have to remap the controls the throttle will always be set at 50% (so I'd suggest setting it to an axis control that you can pull back on. sorry) I Think\u00a0game-pad mapping for flight games works best.</p>\n<p>and as this is a game jam project, I didn't have time to make menus, you may want to run it in windows mode, or you'll have to alt-f4.\u00a0</p><p>I don't own a mac so I couldn't test the mac build, I'll get a friend on it ASAP.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/858/858a37412f3e0e37a645482dc0d1129d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DustedHam"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
