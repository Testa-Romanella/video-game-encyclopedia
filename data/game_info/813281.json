Bad boy turned soft boy, in other words.\u00a0<em>(He/him,\u00a0</em><em>gay</em><em>)</em>\n<ul><li><strong>Noah Larson</strong>\u00a0or <strong>Nova</strong></li></ul>\r\n21 years old.\u00a0Noah is one of Raven's childhood friends, and he knows too much about them. It is believed that he can see things others can't. Noah was mischievous as a child, though now he is much more considerate and gentle. His boisterous laugh and a whole lot of inappropriate jokes still can fool almost anyone into believing that he's doing fine, though those rapidly multiplying white hairs\u00a0tell another story.\u00a0<em>(He/him, pansexual</em><em>)</em>\n<ul><li><strong>Olivia Larson</strong>\u00a0or <strong>Liv</strong></li></ul>\n<em>21 years old</em><em>.</em>\u00a0Olivia is another childhood friend of Raven's, and even though she joined the Larson family much later than Noah did, she considers Noah and Raven her siblings. She'd never say that aloud, though. At first she might seem rude and antisocial, and, there's no denying it, she really is. She doesn't have friends besides those two, and she doesn't really care; being around human beings hurts her in ways Raven is yet to learn.\u00a0<em>(She/them, panromantic/asexual</em><em>)</em>\n<ul><li><strong>Phil Moore</strong></li></ul>\r\n29 in human years, real age\u00a0is yet unknown. They are Raven's new History professor, fair and mysterious, also kind of an arse to those poor souls who miss their classes on regular basis. Cold and strict, Phil is the most proper and upright person Raven will ever meet. They do, however,\u00a0have a scary side to them, but we don't have to be worried about that just yet...\u00a0<em>(Gender-selectable, demisexual</em><em>)</em>\n<ul><li><strong>Sebastian Ravenstorm</strong> (26)</li></ul>\r\nIs the closest of Raven's relatives and the best brother they could ever wish for. A bit annoying at times, but who isn't? Raven is his favourite little sibling in the whole world, and he needs them to know that every second they spend with him. He had been worried about Raven after they had moved out of the family house, and for a good reason.\r\n<ul><li><strong>Howard Ravenstorm</strong>\u00a0(52)</li></ul>\r\nRaven's father\u00a0was upset that they moved, but never voiced his concerns. He lets Raven do anything they wanted with their life, but he'd be more than happy to have them back home, as with just him and Bash the house often gets lonely. Raven is someone Howard desperately wants to keep safe, however, he is afraid of hurting them with the family secrets like he had hurt their mother many years ago.\r\n<ul><li><strong>Rachael\u00a0</strong><strong>Delacroix</strong> (47)</li></ul>\r\nA successful\u00a0actress,\u00a0\"<em>Rae</em>\"\u00a0of sunshine, and\u00a0Raven's mother. Even though she is far away, she makes sure her youngest child is happy, as they are the only one in contact with her from Ravenstorm family. Unconditional\u00a0support, expensive gifts and hilariously\u00a0questionable inspirational quotes, those are just a few things she can provide to Raven should they mention\u00a0it. Despite her tight schedule, Rae can always spare some time for a chat with her favourite kid.\r\n\n<p><strong>P. S.</strong>: Also, there are probably\u00a0going to\u00a0be grammatical errors and typos, as English is not my first language, and, frankly, I have an attention span of a toddler.
