Or a sloth. Or even a freaking blowfish<br/></li><li>Choose a ridiculous vehicle - like a toilet on wheels or like a flying propeller attached to your butt<br/></li><li>Get to the other side of the level to win, you know how this works, you\u2019ve played games before I don\u2019t need to explain this you\u2019re on the internet, jeez<br/></li><li>Unlock stuff yourself instead of just getting it handed to you by the government, like a useful tinfoil hat or a dead octopus on your head<br/></li><li>Don\u2019t cake your pants<br/></li><li>A custom level editor gives endless replayability by letting you make your own levels, and also play other people\u2019s levels, you know how level editors work too, just </li><li>stop reading this and buy the damn game<br/></li><li>Very cool physics-based gameplay that is 100% accurate in any situation, I don\u2019t really know how physics works though i wasn\u2019t paying attention in school</li></ul><br/>Basically you\u2019re far better off playing this game than whatever else you\u2019re doing with your time and your mom\u2019s money, which is probably buying economy glue in bulk. <br/><br/>But seriously, don\u2019t eat anything with chemical solvents in it, it messes with your mind, <br/><br/>We\u2019ve poured our hearts, souls and butts and money actually all our savings (yes our glue savings) into this game so we really hope you\u2019ll enjoy it. Sometimes the work hours get long, but that\u2019s no excuse to start eating glue seriously - that stuff will mess you up<br/><br/>you can play.. you choose your chicken, then you choose like a plane or a hover tank or whatever you want to ride, then you put on a goofy hat and you hit the gas buddy<br/><br/>then you try to get to the end of the level to unlock the next level and you also get maybe a new vehicle or at the least a new hat for your head to show your mom<br/><br/>ok that\u2019s it that\u2019s pretty much the whole game. im gonna go eat some gl", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-16T11:36:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/097/0978ea5ba04bf0545ab9c126da2878a6.jpg", "website": "http://doublemoose.com", "rating": 2.65, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 231, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 9, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 68, "ratings_count": 17, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "Android", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["DoubleMoose"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Family", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DoubleMoose"], "esrb_rating": null}
