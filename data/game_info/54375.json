It was developed by Midway Games and published and distributed by Nintendo. It is the first game in the Cruis'n series and features locations around the United States.</p>\n<p>Although Cruis'n USA was advertised as running on Ultra 64 hardware (based on the Nintendo 64's hardware), it was actually implemented on the Midway V-unit hardware. The hardware consisted of a TMS32031 CPU clocked at 50\u00a0MHz, an ADSP-2115 DSP clocked at 10\u00a0MHz for sound and a custom 3D chip that could render perspective-correct but unfiltered quads at a high resolution (512 x 400 pixels).</p>\n<p>Along with Killer Instinct, it was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo 64. Neither game made it out for Nintendo 64's launch, however.</p>\n<p>It was released on Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on March 28, 2008, making it the first third party developed Nintendo 64 game to be released on the service. It became available on the Virtual Console in North America on March 31, 2008.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-14T14:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbb/dbb058766f29b1dd5dd4cd71bfb228ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.82, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 13, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 22, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 22, "platforms": ["Wii", "Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Midway Games", "Williams"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
