{"id": 833568, "slug": "war-dots", "name": "War Dots", "name_original": "War Dots", "description": "War Dots is simple-graphics, simple-gameplay strategy game. Recruit soldiers onto the battlefield and let them fight for your glory. Be careful though, once recruited, they are on their own. Evaluate battlefield situation fast, time your actions precisely and lead your army to victory.<h3>Straight into action</h3>No complicated tutorials, basics are easy to understand, new mechanics are added continuously as the game goes on.<br/>Missions range from 1 minute battles to 10+ minute wars. 50 handcrafted levels without random generation make sure the difficulty is tweaked just right (hard but still beatable).<h3>Bad luck? No problem.</h3>The game's designed around losing and retrying, rage-games style. One button restarts level instantly, without annoying loading screens. Keep on trying, keep on improving, to eventually become the best dot commander!<h3>Deceptively simple</h3>Some units are great on their own, while some will require assistance to achieve anything of value. Try out different combinations and find new counters to anything enemy can throw at you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T06:41:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb3/cb3f8ab26ba0f3e40db03c7b0ea72051.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZdzichuKalafior"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["ZdzichuKalafior"], "esrb_rating": null}
