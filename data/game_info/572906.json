The main goal is to land on as much different planets as you can, while managing your Fuel and shooting at the switches that control the landing platform gates.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The more precise you land on a platform, the higher your score (60 to 100). Be careful not to touch the ground too hard, otherwise your spaceship will get crushed in pieces.</li><li>Every 500 points you are provided a floating Fuel Tank, that will replenish 20% of your spaceship tank. If you choose not to pick it up, you will have to wait for the next 500 points, so don't miss the chance.</li><li>Every 6 planets you visit you will face a more difficult challenge, where the planet will\u00a0have a switch controlling the Landing Platform Gates, you have to press the red button either by shooting at it (use button X to shoot!) or by landing on top of it (its riskier, but it grants extra 80 points!!).</li></ul>\n<p>Buttons:<br/>Spaceship Weapons: \u274e<br/>Spaceship Controls: \u2b05\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f<br/><br/><br/><strong>If this game made you have some fun and spend time on it, please consider leaving a comment and sharing your Highest Score, to challenge other Pilots!!\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/><br/>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:09:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f2/3f22cef202ed3940a80250e661434f5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JohnFerreiraJr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
