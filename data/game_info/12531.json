You are a new arrival to town, and since you have no money, you take out a loan. The rest is up to you. Build yourself a house, buy weapons and decorations + furniture, ride horses, practice your aim on target dummies and more. Almost everything in your home can be customized. If you want to steal from houses, you can do that too. The choices are all yours. Become the mayor, a police officer, doctor even plant your own crops, becoming a makeshift farmer, or steal everything in sight, becoming the richest thief.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can change materials on furniture and objects, customizing your home to make it your own. If you move out of town into the wild, you can build your home anywhere.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298dcfc3297a1ed8666f4ecd2298fa56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ice Cold Entertainment", "Ice Cold Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ice Cold Entertainment", "Ice Cold Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
