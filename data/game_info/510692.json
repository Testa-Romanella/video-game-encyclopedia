As for the rules of the card game it does not closely follow any of the big CCG boys but it\u00a0tries to do its own thing.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>every turn both players gain in power (Ep enemy points Pp player points).</p>\n<p>you can view your minion's power requirement if you select them after selecting your hand. Then you can\u00a0 select the card and choose a spot in the board to place the minion if you can afford its power cost.</p>\n<p>whenever two minions are aligned vertically they will attack each other and absorb the entirety of each other's attack power. Their HP (bottom number on the cards in play) will change to reflect the damage the sustained. The number displayed at the top of the card is their attack.</p>\n<p>when a minion is not blocked by another minion it will attack the opposing player instead.</p>\n<p>when either player's HP reaches zero the combat ends.</p>\n<p>if both player and enemy HP reach zero in the same turn the player always wins so use this to your advantage!</p>\n\n\n<p>DEV STORY - Somehow, Lion made\u00a0a card game engine in 5 days and an rpg to slap it onto in 1 day and uploaded\u00a0 it to itchio before her power went out that same day.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:52:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a00/a00fdc469e81bd428b27b641343d381d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LionX"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
