A puzzle platformer about messing up code.\r\n<p>In this puzzle platformer, you'll jump your way\u00a0through levels, messing with the code of the game to create bugs features that allow you to make it to the end of the level. Slamming on parts of the code that are exposed through the protective mesh allow you to change the code of the game itself.</p>\n<p>This game was created during the 2021 GitHub Game Off\u00a0as an interpretation of this years theme: Bug!\u00a0This was a family effort between father and sons (12 and 14) where the kids did most of the work and the father played a supporting role in our first game jam. After the game jam is over, we'll add way more levels\u00a0and new pieces of code to manipulate to create more bugs features.</p><p>Source Code on Github</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:18:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/668/668c4c789d5f2d7c20e3e68659ed7196.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mama Goblin Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
