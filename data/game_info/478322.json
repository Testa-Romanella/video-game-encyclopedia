Sadly, he was designed with one critical flaw - Requiring a wind-up key for energy.<br/></strong>Robbob must destroy all 7 continents to satisfy his prime directive. Play as Robbob Jr, an internal helper robot, and solve puzzles to wind-up Robbob so he may have enough potential energy to destroy every continent: smallest to largest! Larger puzzles will be harder; but, they will be neccessary to give Robbob enough energy to destroy the larger land masses.</p>\n<p><strong>Made By:</strong><br/><strong>Sammy Mahmoudi, Me - </strong><em>Programming, Game Design, Concept, SFX</em><br/><strong>Beto Ochoa - </strong><em>Robbob Design, Model, Rig, and Animations</em><br/><strong>Erin Popovich - </strong><em>Level, Item, and BG Models and Animations</em><br/><strong>Kian Lak - </strong><em>Music and Victory Jingle</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T06:33:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f7/4f78906cf2e94c7d9f1e95cc8b8e4c10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["BagelMaster5000"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
