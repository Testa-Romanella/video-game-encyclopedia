They Don't Sleep is a fast-paced, bite-sized zombie survival life sim with easy-to-grasp gameplay and no lengthy tutorials. Get right into the action and start shooting zombies, managing your supplies, and juggling the needs of Kaya and her child, all while trying to fix her truck and escape.<br/><br/><br/>The zombies never stop coming, but you have the ammunition to stop them--as long as you keep it stocked!  Keep them from breaking through your fences and fix them up when they get damaged.  But don't forget to take care of your baby and your own needs. Stress and hunger can be just as deadly as the ravening horde... to you or your child.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrade seven different skills as you gain experience and level up. Every level you gain persists from run to run, so with each attempt to escape, your odds will improve as you shoot more accurately, run faster, and take better care of the baby.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Like the great games of old, They Don't Sleep doesn't hold your hand, but it doesn't hide information either.  Want to know your chance to hit at 20 meters? How many seconds it takes to repair your truck? How many bowls of stew you can cook in each pot? You got it.<br/><br/><br/>A labor of love by one solo developer, They Don't Sleep features all-original, hand-crafted pixel art, an emotional character-driven story told in bite-sized chunks, and tight, focused zombie survival gameplay.  It's a small game because it's made by one person, but it packs a punch.<br/><br/>My mission as a developer is to make small, engaging, meaningful games that you can jump right in and have a great time with and put back down when they're done.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T07:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/647/647bd33b84a377ced53a1bd6efd36fe2.jpg", "website": "https://www.theydontsleep.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Missing Middle Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Missing Middle Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
