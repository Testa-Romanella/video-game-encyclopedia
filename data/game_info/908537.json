It is a collaboration between Bite The Chili Productions and Raft Labs Interactive. Assume the mantle of the mysterious folk hero Candlemaster Cedric or the elusive Orchid of Mourning, and wall-jump your way through the trials this fast-paced, multi-scrolling platformer has to offer. Inspired by classics like Tecmo\u2019s Ninja Gaiden and Sunsoft\u2019s Batman, The Storied Sword is sure to raise the challenge level for NES Homebrew platformers and bring players the 8-bit twitch-combat style they know and love.<br/></p>\n<p>Programming/Design:\u00a0Nathan Tolbert (Gauauu)</p>\n<p>Graphics/Sound/Design: Jordan Davis (Raftronaut)</p>\n<p>Auxiliary Illustration:\u00a0Steve D'eau<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Which version should you\u00a0download?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Both ROMs are identical in gameplay.\u00a0Try the GTROM version first.
