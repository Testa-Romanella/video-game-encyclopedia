Unfortunately, whilst this module is made solely by me, the Stryx main world-book was made by a small team, and so I don't have sole rights to release it.</p>\n<p>As such, for now this book is not super usable, but is still hopefully interesting. If anyone would like a copy of the Stryx main book, please feel free to contact me and I'll talk to the rest of the team.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:53:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/118/118c8e679a713dcbcbf1d6fd3891815d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neighbourhood Snake"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
