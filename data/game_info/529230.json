Title screen animation is bugged, camera collisions are a bit wonky, and the slide puzzle is unfinished.</p>\n\n<p>Humanity has been driven underground. Due to reasons long forgotten, everyone sought refuge in subterranean cities. You, the player, have decided that you\u2019ve had enough of being told what to believe about the surface, and you steal the Master Key, which is able to unlock the various doors keeping everyone inside. After leaving the colony, you make your way through the various rooms and floors, avoiding guards and shutting down various security measures in place. Sure, you could escape\u2026 but <em>should </em>you?</p>\n<p>Travel through the 9 (currently 3) floors of the colony,\u00a0piecing together the mysteries behind why everyone lives underground, as you try and figure out if it's really safe outside. Are you being lied to and exploited, while the surface is perfectly fine, or have you been down here for your own protection? It's a dangerous question, but it's your mission to find out.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>E - Interact/Pick Up/Use</p>\n<p>I - Open Inventory</p>\n<p>Left Click - Talk</p>\n<p>Shift - Crouch</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>- Project Manager -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Christopher Pugliese</p>\n<p>- Programmers -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dennis Chen</p>\n<p>Christopher Pugliese</p>\n<p>Sean Dowd</p>\n<p>- Art\u00a0&amp; Models -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hoon-Sook</p>\n<p>- Level Design -</p>\n<p>Joseph Nash<br/></p>\n<p>- Music &amp; SFX -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Christopher Pugliese<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made in Game Dev 1, Fall 2020.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaa/eaaf46b7982f966832f5416396c7c312.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["puglic"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
