{"id": 299540, "slug": "motocross-mania-3", "name": "Motocross Mania 3", "name_original": "Motocross Mania 3", "description": "<p>Motocross Mania 3 is a motocross racing video game developed by British company Deibus Studios and was released in April 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game was the third in the Motocross Mania series, and the first to be released for sixth-generation consoles. The Xbox version has Xbox Live, and top scores on a particular track are automatically posted.</p>\n<p>The game focuses on vehicular combat, and players can use various weapons such as baseball bats and ice picks to attack opponents. Players can also attack without weapons, which involves attacking while airborne, which the game considers as &quot;showing off and kicking ass at the same time&quot;. There is a &quot;mania meter&quot;, which slows down time similar to bullet time in order to get another opportunity to attack.</p>\n<p>One of the modes available is the Championship, in which players compete in a series of races across 20 tracks and try to finish in the top 4 to advance. Before each race in the mode, players can challenge another driver to a best-of-three series, and if the player wins, they win the driver&#39;s bike. Another event in the Championship mode is the Battle Royal, in which the player with the most KOs win. Minigames are also present in the game, one of which involves a game of &quot;tag&quot;, in which the player who&#39;s &quot;it&quot; has 30 seconds to tag another driver or else they explode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T19:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/801/80189fc197a683cf24a8b2547f6a7dbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Deibus Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["2K Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
