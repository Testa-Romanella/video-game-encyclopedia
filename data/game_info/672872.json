We've mobilized our forces to intercept them and it's up to you to command them to victory in battle!</p>\n<p>Our soldiers have been equipped with personal teleportation devices to traverse the battlefield. Click anywhere within the highlighted yellow area to teleport the selected soldier to their destination. Body-horror prevention fail-safe systems will prevent teleporting into terrain or other soldiers.</p>\n<p>After moving, click on an enemy to fire your weapon at him! If, for some inconceivable reason, you do not wish to fire upon the enemy, you may right-click to face in the selected direction.</p>\n<p>The tab key can be used to cycle through available dominoes who have not yet taken action. Once all you troops have done so, the enemy will have a chance to strike back!</p>\n<p>You can use the left and right arrow keys, or the A and D keys, to view the battlefield from a different direction if necessary.</p>\n<ul><li>Created using Godot.</li><li>3D assets designed using Blender</li><li>Textures drawn using Krita and paint.net</li><li>Music made with GarageBand</li><li>Uses the \"Wretched\" font by Laura Lampman</li><li>Sound effects generated with sfxr\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>(There seems to be some audio stuttering in the HTML5 version, particularly when using Chrome.
