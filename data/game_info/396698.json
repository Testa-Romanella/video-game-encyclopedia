{"id": 396698, "slug": "stranded-sky", "name": "Stranded Sky", "name_original": "Stranded Sky", "description": "<p>For my entry to the 2019 JAMCRAFT 4 game-jam I give you:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>STRANDED SKY</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Completely unfinished;</strong> I lost several days in the middle of this Jame to a 1 in 20 *untraceable* crash, one that in the end I had to rewrite the game and\u00a0generate the whole (smaller) world immediately on load to avoid. Quite honestly I'm just glad to have something that *loads* to submit, and (I think) a fun story told on a floating Voxel island to come back to and to finish making an actual game out of at a later date.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Long story short you capsize from your ship as it warps through *dun dun duuuun* \"The Old World\", a shattered remnant of a place.<br/></p>\n<p>Ultimately the story is about the struggle to survive while awaiting the slim hope of rescue. A bit easy at the moment\u00a0as survival mechanics are not fully implemented yet. You will however get updates every morning from the mind of your capsize-ee on the current situation and objectives... until the dread sets in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Left Click</strong> to \"mine\" a voxel away (no items), <strong>Right Click</strong> to \"build\" a wood plank block.</p>\n<p>Press <em><strong>R</strong></em> to see the inoperative crafting menu and <strong><em>I</em></strong> to see the largely working but still useless inventory screen.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Escape </em></strong>key will pause and unpause the game, and give you the option to save &amp;\u00a0load your world, or quit.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS:</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0- The game hangs for a while on load!</em><br/>Yep, that's the glorious lag of the game generating the whole little world for you. Just wait a few seconds</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0- The 32 bit version is even slower to load and stuttery!</em><br/>Absolutely correct, but it is there on the off chance someone needs it. Can't do anything about it's performance at this stage unfortunately.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0- Crafting and inventory barely exist at all and do nothing</em><br/>Absolutely correct! Ran out of time. Sorry!<br/><em>\u00a0- What's with the frozen lightning?</em><br/>Time constraints meaning I couldn't add the plot-related storm in on time (let alone the hunger, crafting or gathering mechanics!) so it's there because it looks nice.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0- Lighting from the sky only updates after a few seconds of pausing the game.</em><br/>Yea I'm as baffled as you but I've left it in for now.<br/>Make sure to pause the game when it gets proper dark and let it update for some<br/>A M B I A N C E</p>\n<p>Also of note Saving and Loading can get a little weird with new blocks, not erasing them on load back to prior state. This will be solved as soon as a load forces a full scene reload.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:33:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a0817929dedb010723fbc5f38b7972a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WeRideForCoffee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
