{"id": 361041, "slug": "snellseye", "name": "Snellseye", "name_original": "Snellseye", "description": "<p>(English)</p>\n<strong>Gameplay</strong>\n<p>Snelleseye is a small puzzle game based on Snell-Descartes\u00a0law on reflection. You shoot one laser and have to destroy all the green targets. Mirrors are there to help you since the laser can bounce on them. However they are quite fragile and break easily, so be careful.</p>\n<p>All you need to know to play this game is to aim with your mouse and shoot with Left Click. I advise you to play in fullscreen mode since the game is cropped badly in windowed mode.</p>\n<strong>Sound Effects</strong>\n<p>In coming ...</p>\r\nExternal Resources\r\n<p>In coming ....</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>In coming\u00a0...</p>\r\nAdditional information\r\n<p>This game was made in one weekend for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game\u00a0Jam in August 2019 on the theme \"Only One\". You only have one shot for each level and everything can be done with one button (Left\u00a0Click). I didn't have much time to work on the game but I'll definitely come back to it after the jam to add some levels so stay tuned.</p>\n\n<p><em>PS : You can press \"J\" to mute the game.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:44:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/517/51774b6104d55865fd1dab17ed764675.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Aerow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
