Right click to rotate the tile while you're holding it.\u00a0 You can move tiles after they've been placed, but only to valid places on the grid (gaps are ok, but no overlapping). The grid in the top left corner is storage, but still doesn't allow overlapping pieces.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:34:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1e6ec1dec18b51b31c245e31de439a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DifferentName"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
