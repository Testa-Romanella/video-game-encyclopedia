{"id": 832469, "slug": "for-no-eyes-only", "name": "For No Eyes Only", "name_original": "For No Eyes Only", "description": "<p><em>Made for the Multiplayer Game Jam</em><br/></p>\n<p>A secret agent has been sent on a mission to Dr. Villain's underground bunker. The problem is that their mission is so top secret that they're not allowed to even see what they're doing. Their only help is guidance from outside - but is the voice in their ear an ally or a double agent?</p>\n<p><em>For No Eyes Only</em> is a party game where players attempt to guide or mislead whoever is playing as the secret agent. Whether the agent's assistants are trying to mislead or help them has to be figured out on the fly - and their roles frequently change, even in the middle of the mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Playing The Agent<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Each round, a player will be randomly selected to be the agent (alternatively, switch to<em> Lone Wolf</em> mode to have the first player always be the agent - you can stream your game and play over the internet in a call with friends!).</p>\n<p>Once the round begins, the agent closes their eyes or looks away from the screen - no peeking allowed! They must rely on audio cues and the guidance from the other players to navigate the level and complete their mission.</p>\n<p>Scattered randomly around the level are dossiers full of top-secret intel. Walk into them to collect them, and then head to the exit once all of them are gathered.</p>\n<p>However, traps and hazards will also be scattered around the level. Take too much damage, and you will fail the mission - so watch your step!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Playing An Assistant<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Two players at a time will be an assistant - one is an ally of the agent, and must guide them to their objectives safely; the other is a double-agent trying to get them injured or stop them from succeeding.</p>\n<p>Assistants score points at the end of the current turn, depending on the actions that have taken place in it.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0If the agent has spent the time unharmed, has collected intel, or reached the exit, the ally will gain points. However, being hurt, triggering the alarm system or dying will score points for the traitor instead.</p>\n<p>Once a turn ends, new assistants are chosen. You might even find yourself switching sides! Since being awarded extra turns is random though, players' final scores are calculated based on their average performance - consistency is key!</p>\n<p><strong>Traps &amp; Hazards<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The lair of Dr. Villain is full of some of his signature countermeasures:</p>\n<p><em>Spikes</em> are painful to step on, but can be avoided with a well-timed jump.</p>\n<p><em>Fire Jets</em> reach from floor to ceiling, but will shut off for several seconds between bursts.</p>\n<p><em>Laser Grids </em>are equally deadly, but only activate while the facility is on high alert. Wait for the alarm system to shut down, and they will too.</p>\n<p><em>Sensor Fields</em> are not harmful on their own, but loiter too long in one, and the alarm will be raised, activating the bunker's laser grids and reducing the time you have left to complete the mission.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T10:58:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6eeea00069ddb470828eef838678acbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sck8000"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
