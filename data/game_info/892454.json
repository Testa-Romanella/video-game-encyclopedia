The game is completely unbalanced and generally way too easy, apart from the hammer throw event, which is way too hard. It was a Gamejam game, so expect bugs, and also a lot of sound effects and audio queues I didn't get around to putting in. Well, I guess you should not expect the later of those, since they're not there, but you know what I mean.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T11:32:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5f1212e5303f92d8f0ebbefda7764e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["digikerot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
