We decided to make game based on parcel sorting. <br/><br/>The game welcomes you with sorting table, a screen in the top middle, and two rows of boxes, respectively on the left and right side of the table. The goal is to sort as many letters and parcels as you can to correct continent box. After picking the letter (hold left mouse button on it) the flag of destination country appear on the screen and you have to drag it to proper box. Be careful! The further the time goes, the difficulty level and speed of the game will be higher and higher. <br/><br/>Good luck and let there be chaos!</p><p>PROVIZORA<br/>Game design - <strong>Khazad</strong><br/>Graphics 2d/3d - <strong>Rosman</strong><br/>Music &amp; SFX - <strong>Jan Seidel</strong><br/>Programming - <strong>Phone</strong><br/>Programming - <strong>thematt09</strong><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T20:39:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d9/4d927c0259a41f66ed128667e23e602f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PROVIZORA"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
