So I started making one.</p>\n<p>Pike 'n Shot is heavy inspired by both the Gameboy game <em>Mercenary Force</em> as well as the battlefield part of the NES/Amiga game <em>North &amp; South</em>. These games looked so cool to me as a kid whenever I saw screen shots of them in magazines and what not, but then when I actually played them they both proved to be pretty awkward and unsatisfying. Pike 'n Shot is my attempt to make a good game out of the idea of a fast paced, real-time renaissance battle that is streamlined, fun, and plays sort of like a shoot'em up.<br/></p>\n<p>Pike 'n Shot is still in very early alpha status. What I have for download so far is a prototype of the desired eventual renaissance battle experience that I hope you will enjoy. I am working on the game all the time.</p>\n<ul><li>Use your pikes to kill waves of melee attackers or hold off armoured threats</li><li>dodge and shoot ranged troops to avoid losses</li><li>shoot armoured enemies to break their protection and make them vulnerable</li><li>capture loot to build up your coffers (health) and earn special \"doppel soldiers\"</li></ul>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li>Z - Pike</li>\n<li>X - Shot</li>\n<li>Arrow Keys - Movement</li>\n<li>Ctrl + 1 - Restart</li>\n<li>Ctrl + 0 - Toggle Full Screen</li>\n<li>Esc - Quit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Works with most controllers too (Xbox, PS3, etc)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a00/a003d887309337a0ce89bdae4dae28b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Edward Smith"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
