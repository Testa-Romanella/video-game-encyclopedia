{"id": 841839, "slug": "camping-simulator-mop_bucket", "name": "Camping Simulator (mop_bucket)", "name_original": "Camping Simulator (mop_bucket)", "description": "<p>This is a simple low poly demo game to show various mechanics and aspects of a family friendly survival game.</p>\n<p>The player must sustain themselves with food and drink as well as replenish stamina by sleeping using a bedroll which can be placed on flat surfaces throughout the map and picked up again after use. Sprinting and jumping frequently uses more stamina.\u00a0Sleeping toggles day/night which also changes after a set time when awake.\u00a0The player can be injured by hostile NPCs or by neglecting to sleep, drink, and eat. Lost health is replenished by keeping the other status bars in the green percentages. Hostile NPCs can be killed by shooting them if the player has collected ammo.\r\n</p>\n<p>There is mechanics to search furniture for a chance to gain items\u00a0which can otherwise be collected around the map in varying quantities. Different areas have higher amounts of each resource and are modelled to reflect this (lumber mill contains abundance of lumber, mountain has abundance of ammo,\u00a0warehouses contain many\u00a0shelves with chance for food, drinks, and ammo, cabins contain some food, drink, ammo and spare bed rolls, picnic areas have some food and drinks). Entering large buildings will allow access to many resources but also contain many hostile NPCs to balance risk and reward.\r\n</p>\n<p>There is base building mechanics which players can use to build free standing structures or co-opt existing caves or buildings, with out of the way places that must be built up to\u00a0for access such as roofs usually\u00a0containing some amount of resources to balance effort and reward. Building options include wall, wall with door (opens automatically as player approaches), platform/ceiling, stairs, and delete existing built object.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player can also ride a horse which allows them to move quickly around the map without expending stamina excessively however the horse must be dismounted to use items or enter buildings and will run away if left idle too long. It also makes it difficult to see where you're going with the horse's head in the way.\u00a0This is so the convenience of the horse has trade offs to balance gameplay. The horse can be confined by built objects to prevent it escaping or keep it stabled when not in use.\r\n</p>\n<p>If the player loses all health they will respawn at their bedroll if it has been placed or if otherwise will return to the starting point. If the player loses track of their bedroll they can pick up a spare which will erase the previous placement.\r\n</p>\n<p>In early gameplay the\u00a0player must constantly replenish resources and flee from attacks however once they collect a large amount of resources\u00a0which is not difficult to achieve they can focus on building and exploring more leisurely. The game state is persistent with automatic saving when exiting the game (in pc mode only\u00a0not browser).\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>Press and hold\u00a0WASD keys to move. Spacebar to jump.\u00a0Left click to use items (right click on placed bedroll to sleep). Press F to search furniture or mount/dismount horse. Number keys 1-5 to select items in inventory. Scroll to change build model.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is an old project that was extremely broken which\u00a0I have hastily fixed and have not thoroughly bug tested so be mindful that there may be some\u00a0bugs or issues with gameplay.
