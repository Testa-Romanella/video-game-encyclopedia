One day, a very powerful adventurer marches into your house, and steals your most precious artefact. In order to get it back, you need to become more powerful than him.</p>\n<p>During 100 days of dealing with pesky adventurers, you have to build up your arsenal of magic items. You are however too old and frail to go out and find new items yourself, so you trick the adventurers in doing it for you.</p>\n<p>Drag and drop items from your storage onto the pedestal, and click on the pedestal to give the item to the adventurer before you. The adventurer will go on a journey, and return at a later date with even stronger magical items.</p>\n<p>If you click on the pedestal while there is no item on it, you will fight the adventurer. If you are victorious, you will take all of their magic items!<br/>However, losing the battle will result in you taking half a heart of damage. Losing all 5 of your hearts means game-over!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Result of a 4 day gamejam with 2 game developers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T16:35:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a0607f5832271b24e5cf7e5c08510b04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Robo Bonobo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
