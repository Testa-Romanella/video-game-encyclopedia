You'll have to understand to beat the game, otherwise YOU will be the monster... \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Controls (KEYBOARD or GAMEPAD):</strong> <br/>\n<strong>L STICK </strong>or <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong> to <strong>MOVE </strong><br/>\n<strong>A</strong> or <strong>SPACE</strong> to <strong>JUMP</strong> <br/>\n<strong>SELECT </strong>or <strong>R</strong> to <strong>RESTART</strong> level <br/>\n<strong>ESCAPE</strong> to <strong>QUIT </strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Making of: </strong><br/>\r\n\tI made this game using <strong>Game Maker Studio</strong> (as you can see in the splash screen). It is a basic Platformer but I tried to send a cool message to the player. \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Graphics</strong> were made using PyxelEdit. I planned to do more sophisticated artworks but I am not that good so I kept it minimalistic. \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Music</strong> are composed with Fruity Loop Studio 9. \r\n\t\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Sound Effects</strong> are made with bfxr.net \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tI hope you will enjoy playing my game and don't hesitate to give me feedback. It would be very useful for my next games! \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tQuentin Kergu\u00e9len \r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e687510261ad8424ac66ab3957d1a752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quentin Kergu\u00e9len"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
