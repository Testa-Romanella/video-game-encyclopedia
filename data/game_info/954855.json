Travel between realms while fighting monsters and solving puzzles to get through the different sections of the level! Items from powerful deities, reserved for those who can wield its power. Will you bask in the glory or get consumed by the fiend?</p>\n<p>-Description-</p>\n<p>Monsoon is our submission for the game jam, and it is based around the theme \"duality\".\u00a0For that reason, we chose to play with 2 celestial bodies, the sun and the moon, and associate them with mechanics. Traveling in the realm of the sun will have you solve puzzles to unlock new paths and access the level in the realm of the moon, which is filled with fiends and monsters! The game has a small roguelike feel, but remains gentle in terms of complexity.</p>\n<p>-Credits-</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Programmer &amp;\u00a0\u00a0Game Designer:</strong>\u00a0Nicolas Beeler<br/><strong>Lead Artist:</strong> Sasha Eikel<br/><strong>Programmer &amp; UI</strong>:\u00a0Cladkoewka<br/><strong>Programmer &amp;</strong><strong>\u00a0Data Manager:</strong> Florian Reinhardt<br/><strong>Special thanks to:</strong>\u00a0Charles Peter</p>\n<p>-Assets-\r\n</p>\n<p>Assets are a combined mix of the Asset Store and Assets we made ourselves (using Maya and other third-party software.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Asset Store Assets:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/modular-medieval-lanterns-85527\r\nhttps://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/roman-furniture-roman-villa-pack-165586\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>Walls and Floors were made using\u00a0https://withpoly.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>Sounds taken from\u00a0https://freesound.org/\u00a0&amp;\u00a0\r\nhttps://pixabay.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T10:51:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf0/bf0b2b9788bc7ee84010dd11b046a1d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkMoves"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
