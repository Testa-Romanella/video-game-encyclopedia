The objective of this game is to beat the big bad boss located in the center of the map. To beat this boss the player must walk around the graveyard and find tombs with a corpse in them. After that, the player must plant a seed in it and after some time the seed sucks the power out of the corpse and the seed becomes a full-grown plant. Since these plants are magical they grow roots and walk toward the boss damaging it. This cycle continues until the boss\u2019s hp is depleted.</p><p>Visit our website to learn more!! -\u00a0\u00a0Home | Necroplantin (aatifsattaur.wixsite.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T15:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/677edf086f8959728c2798edce27a6a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MonsterSpillStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
