{"id": 689820, "slug": "futbolin", "name": "Futbol\u00edn", "name_original": "Futbol\u00edn", "description": "<p>Futbol\u00edn is a traditional foosball game that brings the table soccer experience straight to your Android. The teams are already set up, so you only have to choose the group you want to join and whether you want to play against the AI or a friend with the offline two-player mode.<br/><br/>The gameplay in Futbol\u00edn is similar to a soccer table: each team controls four rows of players that they can move up and down to tackle the opponent's ball. Once you have the ball in your possession, arrows will surround your player and let you change the direction of the shot to kick the ball. Like this, you can create amazing shots, passing the ball between players and taking a shot at the goal when you think the time is right.<br/><br/>Each player has different stats like shooting power and cutting and keeping the ball. So, you must carefully think about your initial line-up. The shooting power is the speed at which the ball covers a certain distance according to the player's stats. Cutting is the ability to take the ball when it's close to your player (this stat is very important when you want to take the ball off the opponent). The ball control stat is the ability to receive, keep and cut the ball successfully.<br/><br/>Although it is possible to enjoy Futbol\u00edn offline, you can also sign in to your account to take part in the weekly player leaderboards. Even though the game's visuals are simple, they are grabbing enough to keep you entertained for hours playing foosball.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T09:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/436/43654f66b3a19a2d83444c6fefa2a52b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["carrot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
