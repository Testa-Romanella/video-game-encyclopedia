During the day, things seem dull. You talk to your parents and wander around your home and it all seems so mundane. During the night, everything is in technicolor. You explore a sprawling, procedurally generated dreamscape full of color, adventure, and excitement. Your imaginary friend, Ghost, is both your guide and your primary weapon in your dreams. Through your dreams, you and Ghost must battle your inner fears or risk being consumed by them.</p>\n<p>This alpha was created by Team Hollow to fulfill the capstone requirement for the MA Game Design Program at American University, Washington D.C.
