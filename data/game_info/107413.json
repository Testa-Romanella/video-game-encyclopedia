It was made over the course of a weekend at HACK UCI 2015. I worked with two other people I met at the event. The terrain is procedurally generated using perlin noise. The rest of the visual effects are implemented with a custom shader program with many tweakable parameters. We also use Unity's built in particle system a bit. To isolate the different audio frequencies of the music we use a Fast Fourier Transform to process the current song in real time. The game has a couple built in songs, but can also load custom tracks when given a valid URL. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cf25d9ca56d91c07b19f1515a09753f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jfc3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
