First to obtain 3 match stars wins the game!</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0Beware: </em>Magic portals have opened up and will lay potions symmetrically through each quadrant.<br/><br/>Use potions to destroy breakable objects in the level and find Magical artifacts like Runes and Scrolls! Runes come in 4 different elements: Arcane (Pink), Earth (Green), Fire (Orange), and Ice\u00a0(Blue). Scrolls might give you an edge... Or be your downfall.<br/><br/>\u00a0Use a single Rune to quickly power up your potion or find two Runes to create new explosive combinations. Double Runes of the same element create a bigger effect than it's single Rune mix.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Over too fast? Return as a ghost to seek revenge and come back to life. Ghosts can't place potions but are able to interact with already placed potions.\u00a0Killing another player will resurrect you with 1 Heart.
