The premise of the game is to solve get to the end door by manipulating the games underlying features. It's more of a proof of concept, so, for now, the two feature's you'll be able to change are the normals (which way the walls face) and the gravity\u00a0(up or down).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I plan on expanding the game in later updates - possibly into a full game! For now, though, I\u00a0hope you enjoy what's I've made so far.</p>\n<p><em>and remember to click on the door at the end!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD - Move<br/>LeftMouse - Interact<br/>RightMouse - Inspect<br/>Q - Page Back<br/>E - Page Forward</strong></p>\n<p>@partially0</p>\n<p>ps- when you open the screenshots they show at a resolution that creates strange artifacts. (ironically) if you want to see them as clear as possible look at the thumbnails as well.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0tried to upload a web browser version and got as far as playing it in the browser. However, for some reason the shader and the web build don't get along, and there were lighting issues. So for now there's just a download. The downloadable version is better though, so no real harm done.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc7963ac0081c6506c13923dfb16fbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Partially"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
