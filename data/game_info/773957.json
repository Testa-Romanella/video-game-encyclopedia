This short playable teaser is only focused on the Basement scene of the game and its only purpose is to showcase what the game might look like in the final product. So expect some bugs and errors while playing this short teaser.<br/><br/><strong>NOTE:</strong>\u00a0This is just a short playable teaser\u00a0made by Keneth Agar of SolitaryStudios, Filipino horror developers, and made in just 2 weeks. This is just an early test and things might change in the final product soon.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you enjoy playing!<br/><br/><strong>DONATIONS:</strong> This game is so expensive to make. Our team is consisting of 4 college students and has limited funds so we appreciate any amount of donations. It will help us a lot!\u00a0Thank you so much!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Social Media:</strong><br/>Fb:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/SolitaryGames<br/>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/SolitaryGames<br/>Website:\u00a0https://solitarygames.wixsite.com/official</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T18:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e2af2fe2f9133ec84a58c551d57dec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SolitaryStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
