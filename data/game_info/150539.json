I'm uploading it for the purposes of the assignment and at the recommendation of my professor. It is a short, atmospheric narrative with a small amount of player choice. Player choice is limited for rhetorical purposes. The Twine is also educational. It attempts to depict and inform the player/user about sleep paralysis and related anxiety issues. For this reason, the Twine can be considered psychological horror from a narrative standpoint.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/432/4326cc05a1a03fa8fbf4f0fee73dac1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Metsik"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
