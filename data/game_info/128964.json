The goal of the game is to find the bridge and the reactor on the ship and fix them before time runs out. Along the way there\u00a0 are droids that try to stop you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made this prototype to test my abilities with Unity, so I'm probably not going to continue developing this game further. Donations go towards covering the asset costs and towards the development of my next game. You can also ignore them. I hope you have fun playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf2c9ab0c7301bea7881b7ea106918ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Polusto"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
