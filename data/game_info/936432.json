{"id": 936432, "slug": "maximum", "name": "Maximum", "name_original": "Maximum", "description": "Maximum - miniature platform game about trampolining. You control an athlete whose task is to do flips back and forth. The game will be over if you land on your head. More flips in a jump - more final points. Simple controls and easy gameplay. Landing flat on your feet gives you more high jump power, and allows you to do more mid-air maneuvers. Collect points and don't fall headfirst.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T04:39:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aa9c83d61c389bfd559b852715949d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soomka Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Soomka Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
