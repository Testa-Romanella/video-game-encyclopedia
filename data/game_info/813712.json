Crank up your state-of-the-art gatling gun and blast through undead hordes to save the world from zombification.</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>Not long ago, in a town not so far from yours, <strong>the dead rose to devour the flesh of the living</strong>. Compelled by an ancient curse, the vile undead have loosed a tide of terror that threatens to drown the world in blood. In a time of unthinkable wickedness, an ex-mil family man by the name of <strong>Gordon Atling</strong> will take up arms and brave certain death to save his country. But he won\u2019t be doing it alone; armed with his trust M268 twenty-barrel rotary machine gun and more ammo than you can shake a severed arm at, <strong>he\u2019s ready to give the devil his due.</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>A frantic battle for supremacy between the living and the dead! Crank the crank to <strong>rev up your colossal minigun and destroy</strong> the undead menace! Keep your health and ammunition bars in mind at all times, and manage what few resources you have in your final stand against the horde! <strong>Harness the power of humanity</strong> in our darkest hour, and crank for your life to save your home from certain death!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>NECROCRISIS features hand drawn art</strong> to set the scene for\u00a0an apocalypse unlike any other. Feel the heat of your M268 as it spits 2,500 rounds per minute as you wade through the warm pools of zombie gore you create in your wake. The signature Strangest.io style will have you looking over your shoulder for shambling undead long after you've powered down your Playdate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Strangest.io\u2019s prime directive is to empower outsider artists to tell interactive, subversive and powerful stories. </strong>We partner with independent artists on all of our projects.
