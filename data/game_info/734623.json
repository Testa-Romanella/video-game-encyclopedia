The release is momentous; it is the first new complete, storied ROM hack in Chrono fandom, and a decisive victory for a community which has had too few ROM hackers and too many ambitious dreams. That can all change, though, as Prophet&#39;s Guile is showing. Warning - For reasons unknown at this time, SNES9x freezes during a certain part, so you&#39;ll have to play it with ZSNES.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T01:13:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ff/8ff5b7a0bff5185347f35a4d6c785c3d.jpg", "website": "https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/362/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "SNES"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
