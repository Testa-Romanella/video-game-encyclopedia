My name is Ben and I'm a professional video game developer! I and a few other industry veterans are part of a mentorship program that teaches the skills and tools of the game industry to aspiring students affected by the conflict in the Ukraine. The handful of students range in age from late middle-school to high-school and are looking to develop skills in programming, graphic design, and writing as well as skills needed to work in any professional environment (Ex: How do you create a resume? How do you work in multi-disciplinary teams?). We have them covered from an expertise standpoint but we would love your help in providing them with adequate hardware. Some of these students would love to make video games, but some of them don't have the hardware to be even able to play them at the moment, let alone develop them!\u00a0<br/><br/>For example, one of my mentees is a student named Sarah who I'm mentoring in basic game design and programming. She is incredibly smart (conversationally fluent in 3 languages!) and\u00a0is a MASSIVE Potter-head (writes fanfiction and everything!) but has been displaced from her home due to the conflict. She is super excited about the upcoming \"Hogwarts Legacy\" video game, but only to watch\u00a0<em>other</em> people play it as she doesn't have a computer that has the specs to run it. I would love to be able to get her a powerful enough laptop that will allow her\u00a0play it herself when it comes out in February! That theoretical laptop would also be an enormous help for her mentorship, as it would allow us to start teaching her more advanced programs like Maya, Unity, or the Unreal Engine.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you could help us by donating at gofundme.com/f/ukranian-jr-dev-initiative. I personally will be matching the first $500 donated!</p>\n\n<p>Game created by @BenColeWu.</p>\n<p>Based on the show\u00a0\"Game Changer\" on Dropout.tv, created by Sam Reich.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T12:05:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d1/3d13e766cecf71d853c6043b7e1f3743.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenColeWu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
