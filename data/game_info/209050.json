The play is deceptively challenging and the reward, a completed masterpiece, is refreshing to the mind and the soul.<br/><br/>Unlike other puzzles where you have a pile of pieces to arrange, Puzzle Brain Break - Cezanne creates puzzles by dividing each masterpiece into 3 x 3, 4 x 4, and 5 x 5 grids and removing one piece. Your job is to move an adjacent square into the empty square, creating a new empty square which you now must fill with an adjacent piece, again and again until you have restored the masterpiece. Think of a one sided impressionistic Rubik's Cube.<br/><br/>Always start with \"Easy\", which is 3 x 3. If you nail it in one coffee break, congratulations on being smarter than us! Enjoy another cup.<br/><br/>While Puzzle Brain Break - Cezanne was designed for busy and creative value producers, the content is suitable for all ages so feel free to challenge your youngsters to give it a try, though getting them to teach you how to solve the puzzles is cheating.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b53/b53697994e2792d8908df55df572d676.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scottsgr"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
