It can be more advanced and tweaked for more tactical as well as strategical gameplay. I still have ideas left that couldn't make it in the game, like:</p>\n<ul><li>Having a helicopter that needs to chase down marked smuggler boats</li><li>Having different supervisors that give you different upgrades and/or downgrades</li><li>Having your radar station being upgradeable with meaningful stuff (Powerful scans as example)</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Gamedesign, programming and pixelart was all done by me, Narsiph.</strong></p><strong>\n</strong><p><strong>Everything around the leaderboard is made by 'Silentwolf' and information(s) can be found on silentwolf.com.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T08:43:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22a/22a269261e246b96ec2ad1e805ee8067.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Narsiph"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
