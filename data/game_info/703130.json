The moment you step in to the game, you will be greeted with intensity and challenge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Split into two unique zones, it is up to you to work your way through the prison's various challenges and obstacles. The first zone contains multiple pathways, giving you the choice to choose your own path, while the second zone is inhabited by dangerous robots who will attack you on sight.</p>\n<p>The game is far from finished, and is more of a prototype/showcase of a potential game idea.
