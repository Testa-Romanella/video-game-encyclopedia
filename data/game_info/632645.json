I only found out about it very late into the contest. I was also considering things like a minigame compilation, and even making my entry in The Games Factory 1.06 to provide the Vitalize plugin with a long-due new software title. Other than me, it's unloved. So sad. :'(</p>\n<p>To always have the latest version, go here, where the game is playable right in the browser. I recommend checking there for any additional features, bugfixes or anything else, as I don't plan to maintain updates here. As of writing, I'm planning to add\u00a0Waluigi sprites I palette swapped from an 8x8\u00a0Luigi sprite by Johan Vinet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T05:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/531/531b53cffcd1985f9fc993e53019cc78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["childishbeat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
