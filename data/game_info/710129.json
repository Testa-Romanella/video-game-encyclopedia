{"id": 710129, "slug": "nanoscopic", "name": "Nanoscopic", "name_original": "Nanoscopic", "description": "<p>A very tiny browser game (specifically a cursorgame) done in the spirit of the demoscene. Its file size is measured in the kilobytes range. In HTML (uploaded to itch.io), it is around 8KiB, but in SVGZ (a way of packing that worked in 2018 Chrome and before, as well as Opera Presto, but can still work if served from Apache or another type of web server with a tiny [1 line] configuration change) it is 3099 bytes, which is 1 byte under 3.1 Kilobytes, which makes this a 3KB browser game (I've provided the SVGZ file for download). It has no quality cap and it does not care about aspect ratio or screen size, or refresh rate. It uses HTML5 canvas and is procedurally generated at your browser resolution or the resolution of what it is contained in. It is based off the iOS 6/Mac OS X Lion Linen texture, the Wii Homebrew Channel banner, and the Mac OS X AlphaBaby screensaver with a sinewave scaling pattern similar to the Mac power LED breathing pattern.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:31:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/231/23106e19a2f70baf8b4d5ba254a552b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sentogiga"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
