Thinking is too tiresome and these adventurers will certainly be fine, so why not throw some dice to decide who goes on which quests.</p>\n\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Dicey Guildkeeper is played primarily with the left-click on the mouse.</p>\n<p>Click and drag upward from the back to draw dice.<br/></p>\n<p>Right click on dice to lock them. This prevents them from being rolled when the roll button is clicked.</p>\n<p>Only locked dice will go on the quest so if you don't want some dice to go, don't lock them</p>\n\n<p>You can decide to add dice to the pot later if you still have rolls left. If you do this, you must perform a roll if you want to lock the dice.<br/></p>\r\nFormations\r\n<p>Adventurers use a 4 line formation. Shields in the front, then Swords, then Bows, then Healers. The enemy will always attack the front line, and in the order from left-to-right.</p>\nNotes<ul><li>Linux fonts may be missing. The Box to the right of the hearts is meant to be an upside down dagger meant to indicate attack</li><li>Linux audio is delayed</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:54:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c5/4c5d213d9cbfb4eedef94002531782cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["NDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
