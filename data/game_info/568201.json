Enjoy this bullet hell shoot 'em up with controls only using the mouse as you slaughter incoming waves of enemies. Failure is not necessarily bad however, as upon death the player will automatically eject their vessel. The player begins controlling a fast bulky ship, and when destroyed the player ejects the ship and controls a stronger but slower escape pod. When the escape pod is destroyed, the player simply ejects and fends off the enemies with an invisible flamethrower.</p>\n<p>Unique Bosses on waves 5, 10, 15 and 20</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:51:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/090/090178f7da9327a28eafa438c78d3855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bredstickxxx"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
