{"id": 449470, "slug": "plastic-ccara001", "name": "Plastic (ccara001)", "name_original": "Plastic (ccara001)", "description": "<p>This is a game I made in Unity for my final year project in Games Programming in University.</p>\n<p>I am passionate about the environment and how I can help it, therefore the purpose of\u00a0this game is to understand what sea life has to deal with everyday. That is for example when a bird feeds off of the fish in the sea. Due to plastic waste and all the toxins infecting the seas and oceans, the sea life has no clue as to what exactly damages them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What I ask of you, as the audience, is to be mindful and make a change in any way possible in your lives. You will be playing as a Seagull (yes I'm aware it looks more like an Eagle but it does the job I think haha) and you will have to feed off of fish to survive. Every fish has a chance of either dealing 20 damage or helping you gain 15 health at random. This is not a game you can win because the sea life also does not get to win in real life. I made this game to make a point.</p>\n<p>What you will have to reflect on is the fact that the sea life does not know how plastic can affect them. But we as humans do. We can make a change.</p>\n\n<p>Game instruction:</p>\n<p>Movement: WASD or ARROW KEYS</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:17:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1be/1bec4a1e5342bb1701604468a67b982b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ccara001"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
