As you go from room to room, clicking on objects in the space changes their color as if you were decorating the house yourself. With time, the walls seem to light up to your touch ultimately culminating in a beautifully vibrant place that you feel comfortable calling a home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For our game, we wanted to focus on the notion that home for us was a place that all of our time and love was poured into to make our own. In\u00a0<em>Housewarming</em>, a home truly becomes what you make of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T04:40:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af5/af5825224101d9dbf073efff98ecdbe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Dellapi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
