Now out in the vast reaches of space, the crew must work together to explore the galaxy and build alliances in hopes of one day saving their home.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Celestra is a text-based online roleplaying game. Similar to other online roleplaying games such as MMOs it differs in that most interaction happens through text, players writing what they want their characters to do, and in that it is an ICly enforced game. All character behavior is considered In-Character at all times.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game takes place in the Milky Way Galaxy 1600 years in the future. Mankind has settled the majority of potentially habitable solar systems throughout the galaxy. Faster than light travel is fairly difficult with jumps between systems taking a few days for those on the vessel but several months pass in relative time for those not on the ship.

There are exceptions, with some systems containing many governments and some empires that span systems.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCome join an immersive roleplaying experience unlike any other, sign up to serve your system, sign up to save your home.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T04:29:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbf/dbfe30840c9b25ffd75e27dfa0ef0883.jpg", "website": "https://thecelestra.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ouroboros Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Ouroboros Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
