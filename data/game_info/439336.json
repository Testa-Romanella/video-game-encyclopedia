The catch is the<strong> more candy</strong> you collect the <strong>bigger you are </strong>and so it is easier to hit you. <strong>Find a balance between</strong> being fast, collecting candy and not making the game too hard for yourself.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is very much appreciated :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T04:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ab/3ab3a90976381809cce1dd33d5236add.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PeanutButte7"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
