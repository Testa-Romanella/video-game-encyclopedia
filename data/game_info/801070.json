Then you can start! Master Shin, a former Grand Master of Mebula, will assist you during your first steps. You will have to fight a fight with his student Daisuke and have to explore a few places on the starting islands and then fight a fight against the former champion himself.<h3>The Great Adventure Starts!</h3>Enter the world, fight your challengers and become stronger. The goal is not only to start with your Start-Mebuly and your first friend \"Sparokeet\". You need new team mates! Look for special places and look for other Mebulies there. A special volcanic crater or a hidden coastal section could harbor them! Train with your team to make it stronger, teach them new attacks, and then travel more areas with other Mebulies.<h3>Find the Challenge!</h3>As soon as you feel strong enough, compete against your friends or members in matches! Whether you need to train even more or take other Mebulies into your team, to become even stronger, will show up! Your strategy will never be perfect, someone will always try to defeat you with a new strategy!<h3>What Will the Future Bring?</h3>The disturbances of the Mebus, the most mythical of all Mebulies, are already visible. The large cloud serpent was very rarely seen by humans. But where it appears, there are great storms. Will the Mebu soon show up above Mebula?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T03:57:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dc54bda1da6f6dcdfb054be7cd4746c.jpg", "website": "https://mebula.bitmeup.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 525, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BITMEUP"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["BITMEUP"], "esrb_rating": null}
