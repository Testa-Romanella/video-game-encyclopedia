Join Nastya Byool as she goes on a dark, surreal adventure that will change her life forever. This kinetic novel will take you about 30-40 minutes to complete, making it a good way to pass the time if you're short on it. Gotta warn ya that it has swearing and somewhat dark jokes/plot developments so be careful if you're not comfortable with stuff like that. Though I do not think any of that is strong enough to require an adult tag.</p>\n<p>You can play it either on android or you can emulate it on your PC, which is a totally valid way to play it in my opinion. You can peep the ost on my bandcamp soon-ish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T07:30:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb4785a2e6824a4917006b01c3c3716f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["harukoplease"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
