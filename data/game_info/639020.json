Once I can get back to work I will add them in and finish setting up atmosphere, then move on to adding the actual horror bits. Then I planned to make another pass on the character sprite and the scenes to clean up the art and add detail. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T05:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a4/6a41b8dbe72ed75fe8e176adbae2c98f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yarr"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
