Over time and with enough Money you can start upgrading your fuel tank which lets you carry more fuel at a time.<br/>The game ends when you're out of fuel or out of health from crashing into too many planets!<br/>You can also hold down the mouse button ingame to get a boost, this will consume a lot more fuel tho!</p>\n<p>More Projects: http://bytespace.tk/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T02:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/913/913c37f7dc19f93e478f1840ea46e4d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RedCubeGaming"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
