Dig through the toys and identify your missing toy. Bring it to the poster to claim it. This game is for the Brackey's Game Jam 2022.1, with the theme \"It is <em>not</em> real\".</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/>-\u00a0Point, click and drag<br/>- Drag toys to the missing poster to check if its correct<br/>- This game relies heavily on color perception<br/>-\u00a0More items means more points!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Notes</strong><br/>I planned for this to be a 3d game where you spin toys around, and you try to discern between very similar toys. Instead, in this 2D version, the toys all <em>had</em> a front and back version that you could flip between, but 1. The matching colors were already obvious from the start,\u00a0 2. the way I implemented the click dragging was <em>very\u00a0</em> janky, especially given the number of items at a time. Now I feel like it doesn't fully capture the Brackey's theme of it is <em>not </em>real. But nevertheless, I hope you have a little bit of fun~</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Music is 8bitcircus from Antti Luode,\u00a0Anttis\u00a0Instrumentals<br/>All art was drawn and colored\u00a0on Clip Studio Paint<br/>Made on Godot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T13:46:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b3/2b33bb094adc001c19c885f791bb1d4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NoonTimeDreamer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
