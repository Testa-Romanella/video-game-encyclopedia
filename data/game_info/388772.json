It\u2019s heavily inspired by the works of Sisyphus and the idea of ennobling power of labor.</p>\n<p>You start your lifespan in a shallow environment of (an allegory of) the cave and slowly work your way to a blooming garden by building and maintaining cave\u2019s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The game is\u00a0deceptively empty at first, but make to mistake - you can populate it all by yourself.<br/></p>\n<p>By no means it\u2019s a god sim, food always will be a problem (you must grow what you eat) and you\u2019ll have to face some other human-specific limitations like an overwhelming urge to multitask, a pain of managing priorities, limited inventory space, absence of game\u2019s wiki and author\u2019s inability to communicate in good English.</p>\n<p>The game is more on hardcore\u2019ish/demanding/oldskool side of a spectrum and requires some exploration, learning and adjusting to its quirks.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a clone of anything, the purpose of creating the game was not an imitation of things I like but rather playing in a sandbox and looking at the ways things unfold. Sandbox game created as a sandbox project. So meta.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li>Get Ice Shards.</li><li>Knowledge is power.
