WILL YOU GET OUT? OR WILL YOU ENJOY YOUR DAYS IN SATISFACTORY CONDITION?</p>\n<p>THIS IS A DEMO, MEANING THE GAME AINT FINISHED YET HUN BUT IT WILL. WE GOTTA GO BACK TO SELLING HEROIN BEFORE THE STORM GETS CLACKY-TOOTHED. THE INDIE GAME SCENE IS FULL OF EITHER BORING COMING-OF-AGE RPGS ABOUT DEPRESSION OR GENDER DYSPHORIA OR SOMETHING\u00a0OR ITS SOME HORROR GAME ABOUT EDUTAINMENT OR ANALOG HORROR. NO ONE WANTS TO MAKE SHIT ORIGINAL ANYMORE, BUT I WILL LIGHT THE SPARK THAT IS THE NEW INDIE GAME SCENE. ONE THAT IS ORIGINALITY.</p>\n<p>LET MEKNOW WHAT YALL THINK BY CONTACTING ME ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES BELOW:</p>\n<p>WRITTEN, CODED, AND GRAPHIX BY CORREAN COLLAR\u00a0</p>\n<p>(twitter: @CorreanCollar</p>\n<p>\u00a0instagram: @craunchamarmoset</p>\n<p>discord: Correan Collar#8286)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T16:09:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b69/b69ae8b1efce4a68b2522c0d89877043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PIRATE RADIO GAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
