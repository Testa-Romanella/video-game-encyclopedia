{"id": 542725, "slug": "party-hunt", "name": "Party Hunt", "name_original": "Party Hunt", "description": "<p>Party Hunt is a game where as the party planner for the penguin party you are in search for the five items needed for the party which include fireworks, cake, party hats, presents, and a boom box. Search around the frozen landscape in hopes of finding these objects which can be located in igloos. To reach these igloos you will need to get through obstacles which some require pushing ice blocks into specific places. To reach the party you will need to collect all five so make sure to check in all directions. Controls include A and D to move and Space to jump. This game was made for the 5th Kindred Community Jam where I picked the theme penguin party. All art and sounds was made by me in around 4 days. Thanks for hosting this jam I really enjoyed the theme. Any feedback is appreciated.\u00a0 Thanks and good luck!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T03:26:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/592/592fd3b93cefba1f6c93d2d10f75692e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bp026"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
