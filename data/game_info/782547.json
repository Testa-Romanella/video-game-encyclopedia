Head Chef, Lorin, and Lead Server, Armando are deep in a heated argument, that quickly turns devastating for the restaurant. When Armando storms out, the night\u2019s service seems like it\u2019s headed for disaster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a world-renowned food critic on his way to the restaurant, and without a lead server there to run the dining room, this evening could fall apart. In a last-ditch effort, to try to pull off a successful dinner, Frankie is asked to serve the food critic. If she accepts, she\u2019ll be given the details of each course to present to the food critic.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The challenge? She has to remember everything, without writing it down, and with following the Chef\u2019s rules perfectly. She can\u2019t upset the food critic, and she can\u2019t upset Chef Lorin.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If she can get through dinner without it becoming a disaster, she might just have the career she wants at Caf\u00e9 Chaos.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T06:52:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f51f439c31e4a050c3eefb25d561316.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["leryl"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
