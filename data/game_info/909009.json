A glitch in the software cause a whole bunch of problems! The livestock escaped their enclosures and is now roaming the wheat field! All the harvesters received a false order to roll out for harvest duty! The driver bots went haywire and now only respond to the emergency obstacle avoidance commands! It is now your job to navigate the harvesters off the field with minimum casualties among the livestock and maximum crops harvested. One glitch shall not stand in the way of your superior programming!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Left click on the harvesters to issue emergency obstacle avoidance command. Doing so will make the harvester change direction at random. You can issue as many of those commands as you want, it <strong>IS</strong>\u00a0an emergency!</p>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the passive harvesters trajectory prediction to carefully navigate the harvesters around livestock and each other.</li><li>Keep an eyes on the harvesters' fuel (shown on the progress bar under each harvester). If a harvester runs out of fuel before exiting the field, it will break down.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Development team</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Daatster#7749 - programming</li><li>IdentityFluid\u00a0- art, sounds</li><li>TheSecondAndroid - art, music</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Used assets/tools</strong></p>\n<p>FFF Forward Font</p>\n\n<p>This game is an entry for Ludum Dare 52 (\"Harvest\").</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T15:40:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1f01cb633afd4dde144791e664e9f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Daatster", "IdentityFluid", "TheSecondAndroid"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
