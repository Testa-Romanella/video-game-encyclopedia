Its a pretty big goal but to reach it I need to know my way around Blender. It was pretty fun and pretty tiresome to make the map and the\u00a0 player. All in all when I have passed the deadline it actually went through my mind to just give up but than I just picked myself up and went on with the project to at least do something fun. I am glad I did because I actually started having fun finishing the game instead of finding it tiresome.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What went bad: I didn't spend all the available time on this and didn't work as hard as I could. I think that it was because of \u00a0bad time management. I will have to work on this and hopefully next weeks prototype game\u00a0will be better. This time I have to meet the deadline on Monday\u00a01.10 event if I am going to do a simple 2d game this time (but I am hoping to use some free store assets to actually make something bigger that this weeks project :D ).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53d/53de4da9a1f81d0021b15546db47b04f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunny Valley Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
