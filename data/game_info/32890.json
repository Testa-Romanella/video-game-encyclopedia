Humans reached the stars long ago, building a\u00a0Republic\u00a0of high technology and universal emancipation\u2014and then squandered it, fought over it, and finally lost it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA\u00a0New Dark Age\u00a0has descended upon humanity, for the greatest of civilizations has fallen and now even the stars are dying. Feudal lords rule the\u00a0Known Worlds, vying for power with fanatic priests and scheming guilds.<br/>\n<br/>\nA grand 4X strategy game developed by Holistic Design Inc., Emperor of the Fading Suns is set in the Dark Ages of Space. It allows players to take the role of one of the powerful nobles fighting to become Emperor of the Known Worlds. Similar to such strategy classics as Civilization and Masters of Orion, Emperor of the Fading Suns offers a sophisticated diplomacy engine, space and ground combat, discovery of new planets, multi-player (Internet) competition and more. While rushed to market, it built a loyal following and spawned numerous, unofficial fan-made mods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 4550 AD, Vladimir I, the first Emperor of the Known Worlds, crowned himself with his own hands and by the Grace of Holy Terra. He was dead within moments. The Regency is vacant and all humanity is preparing to elect a new Regent. But times are changing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mysterious fading of all the suns of the Known Worlds is accelerating, causing increased hardship and a general sense of foreboding. The Fading Suns are a portent, it is said, of coming Armageddon.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of the Royal Houses can trace its ancestry to the time of Grand Emperor Vladimir, who consolidated the fragments of the Second Republic into one might Imperium. As ordered by the Great Charter, in the event of an Emperor's death, human space was to be ruled by an interim Regent. However, no Regent has been able to harness enough power to declare himself Emperor. In the meanwhile, the Regency has become a means to loot the Imperium.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany feel that the human race needs strong, dedicated leadership to face the uncertain future - a selfless leader willing to take a personal interest in the fate of the Imperium. But the Regent has been a mere figurehead, who can at most discourage inter-human conflict. Humanity's only solution is to make the position of Regent a hereditary one, to once again have it called by its ancient name - Emperor. Then the future of the entire Empire will be the overriding concern of the Emperor, instead of just the short-sighted good of his own House.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you lead your noble house, be it selfless Hawkwood, debauched Decados, scheming al-Malik, pious Li Halan or militant Hazat, to final victory? Will you return humanity to its once-shining glory? Dare you to become Emperor of the Fading Suns?<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T02:01:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39d/39dcfb38842b5915b2a149afee500870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 10, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Holistic Design"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Holistic Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
