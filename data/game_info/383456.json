Only one object will be simulated, a cube. It has to start at a random location, with a random orientation inside the simulation box. At the start, a random ascending force is applied to some random point within the cube (doesn\u2019t have to be one of the cube\u2019s vertices, necessarily). The other force in action is gravity.</p>\n\r\nUsage\r\n<p>Use the GUI to toggle settings.</p>\r\nTechnology\r\n<p>C++ with OpenGL</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Marc Molina - Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Joan Ginard - Programmer\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T05:49:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc5/bc508aeea9bb20b805cac6c86479b7e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joan Ginard Mateo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
