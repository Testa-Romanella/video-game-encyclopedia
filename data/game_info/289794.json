There are some requirements as this is a game where you try to destroy yourself, but there is a balance between mobility and firepower.</p>\n<p>This is a game for Wizard Jam 8!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T05:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9c/a9c436ba50283183abc028d2e7affedf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandon Schapekahm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
