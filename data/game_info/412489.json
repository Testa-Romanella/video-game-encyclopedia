Your ship rapidly evolves as you defeat enemies, allowing you to shape its abilities and weaponry to your desires in a matter of minutes. Unlike many ARPGs which can absorb hundreds of hours of time, Nova Drift allows you to take a ship build from inception to execution in a single game session.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original soundtrack to Nova Drift, produced by Miles Tilmann. <br/>Since Nova Drift is currently In Development, more tracks will be added as they are completed and added to the game.\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T01:52:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09a93fdcc901467c5710020ee4cb5b9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pixeljam", "Chimeric"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Pixeljam"], "esrb_rating": null}
