Read below for more information on the game, and its development!\u00a0</em></p>\r\nWelcome to the BOARD:\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for checking out CONSOLATION: BOARD MEETING!\r\n</p>\n<p>In summary, it is a multiplayer party game, with a darker undertone. Traverse a board game board in a board meeting for a chance to be on the board of directors! Welcome to Consolation.\r\n</p>\n<p>There is currently only 1 board, and 4 minigames. However, you may find there is plenty of outcomes and content to enjoy!\r\n</p>\r\nA Party Game above all else!\r\n\r\n<p>Pick a name, or socialize using in-game chat. There is something for everyone to socialize and have a good time, with friends or with strangers.\r\n</p>\n<p>Primarily the MOUSE and WASD are used to traverse and control the game. Players can host a game using the Consolation Matchmaking services (Which are only accessible through an internet connection).\r\n</p>\n<p>Characters from other Sayincraft games and projects will guide you through the challenges you face ahead of you on the board.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game has a spinoff story in the unique (Sayincraft Studios created) CONSOLATION timeline, with a more dark yet comical take.\r\n</p>\r\nA Dark-Comical Story\r\n\r\n<p>You are an employee at the evil corporation, Consolation Innovations. You have been invited by the CEO, Christopher Conn to join him for a board meeting. There you learn you must compete in a series of challenges against fellow employees, presented as a board game, in order to climb the corporate ladder. Welcome aboard!\r\n</p>\r\nStreamer Friendly!\r\n\r\n<p>The game has many original and unique songs in its soundtracks catalog, one of which even has original lyrics based on the game's story and themes! Though it may seem off-putting to streamers, rest assured Sayincraft Studios owns and manages all songs used within the game. Should an issue arise, contact Sayincraft Studios directly and it will be solved promptly! :)\r\n</p>\r\nOriginal Music, Art, and Talent!\r\n\r\n<p>Consolation: Board Meeting features many original artistic works from many talents such as music by\u00a0<strong>MojoKing</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>Musithical.\u00a0</strong>And visual art by Sheridan Animation student\u00a0<strong>Bagged_Milkk</strong>.\u00a0We are looking forward to everyone getting a chance to experience it all.
