It borrows from familiar real-world installations, that abstract and manipulate reality, to see what happens when what's being abstracted is not actually real.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis 10-minute experience takes you on a journey from dawn to dusk, from water to sky, from virtual to reality and back again. Starting on a platform at the base of the virtual dome, you will rise through the vast void, surrounded by an ever-changing performance of realities.<br/>\r\nNo controllers, no interactions, no phone, no Instagram. Allow yourself to escape your reality and be completely immersed in another.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T19:09:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17d/17dbc48182f3d8115e407e38cfa8d6a8.jpg", "website": "https://level11.space/reflecthorizons", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Level 11"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Level 11"], "esrb_rating": null}
