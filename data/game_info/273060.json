The person holding the dimensional secrets will master the destiny of earth. Vicious dimensional beasts knew these. They abducted girls of the earth and imprisoned them at the most dangerous place in the universe. This place is called the Attractorache.\u00a0<br/><br/>The legendary Attractorache is the place with the maximum attraction force. Due to the strong attraction force, even the light cannot escape. Hence, human beings have no idea of secrets of the Attractorache. They only know that our galaxy is always moving around the powerful attraction source.<br/><br/>My warriors. Go into the Attractorache. Save girls of the earth and save the future of human beings!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Attractorache is a game which completely breaks the traditional jigsaw. Yes, must the jigsaw be splicing of \u201cpictures\u201d. We slice the completely dynamic girls (In fact, the posture is a little sexy?). In comparison with the traditional jigsaw, of course the dynamic jigsaw is more interesting. In the game, we will add different challenges. Except for the time challenges, we also have memory challenges, disturbance challenges, etc. The dimensional beasts will release various abilities of them and hinder your smooth splicing.<br/><br/><br/>Attractorache is the first work delicately developed by our studio. The game will keep updating more levels and figures for you. We will add more creative ideas for you in the future.</p>\n\n<ul><li>The first dynamic puzzle game</li><li>Three main characters of earth girl</li><li>20 different levels of difficulty</li><li>Many star series meitu</li><li>Excellent background music for more than 7 tracks</li><li>20 less likely achievements</li><li>Full language support</li></ul>\n\n<p>MAYBE IT A VERY HARD GAME!
