Corporate exploration probes swarm the depths of space, seeking out resource-rich worlds to colonize and exploit. But even in the vastness of space, and true to human nature, disputes over colonization rights soon emerge. Great corporate war-fleets gather, ready to defend their claims. The Earth Federation, humanity\u2019s central government, devises a contest called \u201cMissile War\u201d to prevent a descent into total war. In \u201cMissile War\u201d two rival corporations establish a base on the contested planet\u2019s surface, harvest its resources, and engage in an isolated missile duel. Trade of harvested minerals is permitted, but interference by other corporations is not. The winner, the last corporation standing, is given full rights to the colony, and is taxed by the Earth Federation. Everybody wins; or do they?<br/>\n<br/>\nDirect Hit: Missile War offers a deep strategic experience to those weary of the never ending stream of Command and Conquer clones that dominate the real-time strategy market. While tipping its hat to console classics such as Megalomania, Direct Hit brings many fresh ideas to the table, in particular: separate player maps, and the replacement of classic RTS units by customizable missiles. Set in a Golden-age of planetary colonization, players must battle for mining rights to resource-rich planets by competing in explosive duels called Missile Wars. To win a missile war, players have to build, scan for and mine resources, trade, research, and of course, design the means of their enemies\u2019 destruction: missiles!<br/>\n<br/>\nFeatures:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is a mix of genres:<br/>\n- Unique strategy gameplay system<br/>\n- Classic RTS<br/>\n<br/>\n- 7 stages (14 missions)<br/>\n- 5 tech levels (over 60 technologies)<br/>\n- Over 30 types of missile parts.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b4403b58d99b5d0ad89dde2a32fb9c47.jpg", "website": "http://www.dh.polynetix.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Polynetix Studio", "WIWD Development"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Polynetix Studio", "WIWD Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
