If you do not yet own VRMB1, then I only recommend buying VRMB2 as it contains everything that VRMB1 has, plus more!<br/><br/> <h3>Key Features:</h3> <ul><li>Bowling Ball Powerups (Split Ball, Big Ball, Orbit Ball, Fast Ball)<br/></li><li>5 scoring modes<br/></li><li>5 courses with 10 unique lanes each (including 3 re-imagined legacy courses)<br/></li><li>Traditional bowling lanes with realistic physics (spin, oil patterns)!<br/></li><li>Local Multiplayer<br/></li><li>24 different bowling balls to choose from (16 unlockable)<br/></li><li>Personal best statistics for each lane and scoring mode<br/></li><li>Customizable Sound Effects<br/></li><li>Adjustable Throw Force Multiplier<br/></li><li>Global Leaderboards for each scoring mode on each course<br/><br/> <h3>Improvements:</h3> </li><li> Automatically pick up the ball by pressing the trigger.
