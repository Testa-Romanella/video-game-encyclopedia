Remove all the spikes to win, but first its wires need to be cut.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Rules:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Any red wire needs to be cut first.\u00a0 If any red wires are still live before proceeding the attempt will fail. The light must not be red.</p>\n<p>The blue wires need to be cut first as well, but only on a per-spike basis.</p>\n<p>Yellow wires should only be cut if the light is red.</p>\n<p>Brown wires should always be cut last and there are no green lights.</p>\n<p>Green wires should only be cut if the light isn't green.</p>\n<p>You can measure the frequency that a spike operates at and compare it to the frequency of a light using the meter to your left. It is the most sensitive towards the top.<br/></p>\n<p>All lights must be green or disabled before all spikes can be removed.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Tymen Muller/V3D Games - Programming &amp; Art<br/></p>\n<p>Xor Shaders - Lighting Engine</p>\n<p>Kevin McCloud - Ambient Music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:33:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b4440781248190896a62795864c17b2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VITRIOL 3D Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
