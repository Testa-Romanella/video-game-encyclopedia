Will you be able to single-handedly withstand the firepower of an entire army? Will you be metaphorically steam-rolled by sheer manpower? Or will you take it literally and end up being smushed by an enemy tank?</p>\n<p>One thing is of utmost importance: keep your calm! When push comes to shove and the situation seems hopeless, breathe in and trust your basic instincts. Time seems to move so slowly when you bravely stand up against the imminent danger.</p>\n<p><strong><em>This game was developed as a submission for Weekly Game Jam 153.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Theme of the jam: <strong>Roll</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Team members:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Yeti 47 (a. k. a.
