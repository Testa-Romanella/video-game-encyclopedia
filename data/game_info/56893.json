{"id": 56893, "slug": "italy-1990", "name": "Italy 1990", "name_original": "Italy 1990", "description": "<p>Italy 1990 is a soccer video game published by U.S. Gold Ltd. and programmed by Tiertex Ltd. in 1990. It features the 1990 FIFA World Cup held in Italy but is not part of the official FIFA World Cup series. For the American market it was branded as World Class Soccer. In Europe (except the U.K.) it was released as Italia 1990 by U.S Gold in association with Erbe Software. It was released for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and MS-DOS.</p>\n<p>U.S. Gold had released the extremely badly received official game of the previous World Cup in 1986 (World Cup Carnival). Possibly because of that, they were not given the licence in 1990 (with Virgin Mastertronic releasing the official game World Cup Soccer: Italia '90). U.S. Gold did however reclaim the licence for the 1994 World Cup for the release of World Cup USA '94.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/3149fce44d119eaaf2308647c215f6e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 356, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "PC"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
