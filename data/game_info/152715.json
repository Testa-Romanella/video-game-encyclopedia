Obviously it's not going to be a good game, but I have to start from somewhere. <br/></p>\n<p>If you do decide to download the game, please leave some feedback on what you thought. Whether it's constructive criticism or word vomit I'm interested in what you think. I plan on adding to this game as I learn new things about game development and the Unity Engine.</p>\n<p>One of the first things I'd like to add is some kind of instructions. I'm thinking about either doing a pre-mission briefing or have a character give you instructions as you go.\u00a0 I'm also learning how to use Blender, and will be looking at MagicaVoxel soon. Hopefully I can make some more interesting objects for the scenery. As for the audio, I will probably have to look at the Assets Store for that. Audio is not in my current capability to learn.</p>\n<p>Leave me some feedback<br/>-Korvette88<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d1/1d1313360e1c429803414983c86ada72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Korvette88"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
