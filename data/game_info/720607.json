Having already had a long spell in hospital and thereafter, embarked on several adventures including a lengthy trip to the moon, he was now determined to escape the stresses of life and take it easy.</p>\n<p>One day at home removing yet more alien-like tics from his fur, picked up from his successful adventure to the moon (he never could figure out how they penetrated his spacesuit) the heard the letterbox rattle. Moritz stood up, spent a few seconds scratching furiously, then sauntered over to the front door and picked up an envelope of the floor. Noticing the portuguese stamp on the front got him wondering why his cousin would be writing when he only messaged him the other day on Skype DN (Dog-net).</p>\n<p>Moritz walked back into the living room, stopped for a second and scratched again, resulting in a couple of tics flying off into oblivion. They'll be back, he thought, finding another pesky place on my fur. He sat down and opening the envelope and sure enough, it's from his cousin with an invitation to stay over for as long as he wants. Sun, Sea, Wine and Fun! Perfect and just what the doctor ordered! There's just one problem... Moritz has got to get there first by travelling through Europe!</p>\n<p>Moritz took no time in the shed, fixing up his C5 and giving it a good polish in preparation for his journey, starting from Germany on the autobahn through Belgium, France, England, Ireland, Spain and eventually to Portugal.</p>\n<p>In every country Moritz is collecting bones (and gold in Ireland ;-))</p>\n<p>If only the venture was an easy one but alas, the road is full of sunday drivers and strange objects like bavarian beer pints,\u00a0 belgique waffles, french baguettes, croissants,\u00a0 british guards, irish leprechauns, spanish bulls,\u00a0 portuguese sarins and well, all sorts unimaginable out to stop Moritz reaching his dream destination, hug his cousin and enjoy paradise to the full.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T07:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d63/d63ef5d8c444b7f775051c806369824a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Moritz CPC"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
