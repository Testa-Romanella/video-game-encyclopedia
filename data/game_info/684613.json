A couple of drinks in, some hours spent dancing, a few games played, the night seems to be going well. Until you, and everyone else in the salloon, hear a loud clinking sound coming from the entrance hall. You go out to investigate and find the front door locked with 8 different padlocks.</p>\n<p>Leaving you no time to wander what had just transpired a horrid, gooey, grotesque, tar-like monstrosity burst through the door swallowing one of your friends whole and leaving nothing but a pile of blood just as the lights go out in the mansion. Panic ensues, and as you try to escape you find yourself in an old closet next to an old, seemingly faulty, flashlight. After sitting still for what seemed to be hours, but was probably not but 5 minutes, and as the screams subside, becoming fewer and fewer, you gather all the courage you could muster, and set out to escape.</p>\n\n<strong>Gameplay:</strong>\n<p>In <strong>The Night of the Living Worm</strong> you must wander around the mansion and find all 8 missing keys in order to unlock and escape through the front door. Be, however, mindful of the monster that haunts these halls, searching for its next victim to feast upon.</p>\n<p>Your only tool is your flashlight which seems to be consuming a tad more batteries than it should. Grab the batteries spread throughout the mansion to replenish your only source of light, or brave the halls in the dark.<br/></p>\n\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\r\nWASDMoveLShiftRunSpacebarInteract\r\n<br/><br/><strong>Evading the Living Worm:</strong>\n<ul><li>The monster is mostly attracted to noise and common sense seems to indicate that people usually make less noise walking than running (which in turn, makes less noise than slamming doors)</li><li>Beds, closets and bathtubs seem to make for great hiding spots</li><li>The monster seems to enjoy the darkness, becoming more agro when all the lights go out</li><li>Whilst the monster's vision doesn't seem to be all that good, after it's caught your scent it won't let go unless you manage to hide before it enters the room you're in</li></ul>\n\n<strong>Credits:</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>Diogo Silva</strong>, Programming</li><li><strong>Patr\u00edcia Henriques</strong>, Art</li><li><strong>Tiago Martins</strong>, Art</li></ul>\n<p>Sound effects obtained from ZapSplat</p>\n<p>This game was developed (in about 3-4 days) for the ScreamJam 2021 GameJam<br/></p>\n<p>We are part of our college game development group,\u00a0<strong>Game Dev T\u00e9cnico</strong>, which can be found here on\u00a0Itch.io, and on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T09:34:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70fe2d2f257fbc4a459c6852eabe1fee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FenixDS", "Nalurianne", "martinitiago"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
