Can you and your friends avoid the monster</p>\n<p>long enough to find the keys and escape, or will you be outsmarted by the Monster and become\u00a0</p>\n<p>their next victim?</p>\n<p>FEATURES:</p>\n<p>- Pass and Play Multiplayer: Up to four players can take their turn exploring (or haunting) the hotel on a single console (or PC). Gameplay proceeds in turns, with prompts for when it\u2019s time to pass the gameboy! But no peeking - you\u2019ll want to keep your plans secret from the monster.</p>\n<p>- Unique Characters: Players can choose from Four unique player characters, each with different stats and starting items that may aid them in their survival, and the monster can choose from Four different monsters with unique powers and passive abilities.</p>\n<p>- Varied Sessions: Every game has a chance to be different - the key may be hidden in different rooms, searching for loot may not give the same rewards, and the monster\u2019s minions may spawn in different areas. You\u2019ll have to adapt your plan each time you play!</p>\n<p>- Tabletop Inspired Cooperative Mechanics: Each character can only move a certain number or rooms or perform a limited number of actions per turn, so you\u2019ll need to plan your turns wisely to ensure your survival and success.\u00a0</p>\n<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>\n<p>MONSTERS want to find and capture all VICTIMS. VICTIMS want to find the KEY and escape from the Hotel (exiting through the FOYER).</p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY:</p>\n<p>- In a game of HAUNTING, you play as either a MONSTER or one of the VICTIMS. All players have three stats: HP, Speed, and Actions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Every turn, you can change rooms equal to your SPEED.</p>\n<p>- You can spend ACTIONS to interact with objects, other players, craft or trade items, use items or powers and more!</p>\n<p>- If a Monster\u2019s HP reaches 0, their turn is over, but a if a Victim\u2019s HP is 0, they die!</p>\n<p>- When you\u2019re out of actions and speed, it\u2019s time to pass the turn (from the start menu).</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>A: Interact\u00a0 \u00a0(J)</p>\n<p>B: Cancel\u00a0 \u00a0 (K)</p>\n<p>START: Menu\u00a0 \u00a0 (Enter)</p>\n<p>SELECT: View Inventory (Victims), Review/Use Powers (Monster)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Shift)</p>\n<p>Credits<br/>Scripter:<br/>\u00a0https://lazydevs.itch.io/<br/>Artist:<br/> https://astrangerontheinternet.itch.io/<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/280/280898ff9ea3805cd2c0095e5cf507f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stranger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
