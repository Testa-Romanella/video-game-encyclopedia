Although technically 3d, Gaian presents as a 2d experience that utilises a grid system for gameplay to represent both the player\u2019s tree and other objects within the game. Tree components such as leaves, branches and wood, roots, and water can be placed in certain grid squares which allow the tree to grow and increase the player\u2019s resources. Resources allow the player to not only continue to purchase more tree components and therefore increase their resources and the efficiency of their tree, but also to protect their tree from potential threats. Resources include water, nutrients, and sunlight.</p>\n<p>The core game loop is the process of players adding additional tree components to their tree in order to increase its efficiency and in turn their resources. This allows the player to use those resources to add more tree components and continue to grow their tree in size.</p>\n<p>Events are also a feature within Gaian. Events are randomly occurring environmental opportunities or threats\u00a0that can have either a positive or\u00a0a negative effect on tree components, or the efficiency of the player's tree and its ability to produce resources. If a tree succumbs to too many threats the player may need to remove components to increase the efficiency of their tree and give it time to recover, or else their tree may die.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Game created by Vernon Grieger,\u00a0Donald Mackay, and Ethan Pearce.
