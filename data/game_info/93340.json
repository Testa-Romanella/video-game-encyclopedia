{"id": 93340, "slug": "crystal-control", "name": "Crystal Control", "name_original": "Crystal Control", "description": "<p>\n<strong>Update 5/30/16</strong> - Crystal Control II is available now!<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMichael Connolly's Crystal Control is the most intense multiplayer game Virtually Competent has to offer. Navigate a storm of bullets in this battle for control over the magic crystals! Make it \r\n\t<em>crystal </em>clear who the most skilled player is!\r\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul>\n<li>P1 uses W/S to move (on keyboard) or Analog/D-Pad (on gamepad).</li>\n<li>P2 uses the Up/Down arrow keys (on keyboard) or Analog/D-Pad (on gamepad)</li>\n<li>Press both movement keys at the same time to fire (on keyboard) or press the A button (on gamepad)</li>\n<li><strong>If your keyboard is having trouble </strong><strong>detecting all four movement keys at once, P1 can alternatively use Shift/Ctrl</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n</ul>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Shoot the crystals to paint them your color. Crystals that you control will fire at your opponent!</li>\n<li>Capture the majority of the crystals on-screen and your \"Control\" ability will activate, causing EVERY crystal to fire once at your opponent!</li>\n<li>Get a single hit on your opponent and you win!</li>\n<li>Are you a visual learner? Just hang out on the title screen for a few seconds and the tutorial will start!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n</ul>\r\nTips and Tricks:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Stay still for long enough and you can charge up your next shot! There are two levels of charge, but the second level takes a while to prepare.</li>\n<li>You'll need a charged shot to capture the smaller center crystals, but they pack quite a bit more punch than the outer crystals, firing three homing shots instead of one straight shot. Take some risks!</li>\n<li>Depending on your level of charge shot, you may be able to destroy incoming bullets or even pierce through them all for a direct hit on your opponent!</li>\n</ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>\r\n\tProgramming by Michael Connolly (\r\n\t@GuardianMC)<br/>\r\n\tArt by Colin Greenhalgh (\r\n\t@CuddlyColin)<br/>\r\n\tMusic by Derek Klaren (\r\n\tSoundcloud)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCreated with \r\n\tScirra Construct 2<br/>\r\n\tSound effects made with Bfxr\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f97/f972b973fbd05abf2ba36af217517a56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Virtually Competent"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
