Timer is displayed on the top-center, and your progress is on the bottom of the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Select one of the sailors by dragging on the screen.\u00a0</li><li>If any of them are hungry or thirsty, a message will be displayed on the top center of the screen. Go to the bench to fish and when you leave, your hunger will be restored. Go to the faucet to get water.</li><li>At least one of the sailor has to be on the wheel for the ship to keep on sailing!!</li></ul>\n<p>1. Inspired by the movie 1917, the two sailors are racing towards the end to deliver an urgent message (couldn't make the cutscene).</p>\n<p>2. Two sailors, two cannons, the ship's hp is 2^2, and I tried to make most of the stats related to 2 somehow. Perfect for the theme: \"Two\" (I hope).</p>\n<p>3. No external assets, that's the reason why the artwork is so bad :(</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or find any bugs, please leave a comment and I will see what I can do :)</p>\n<p>#unitedgamejam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bb/5bb70f9d372c90f2ac4d466c734f9915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["whatthesamuel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
