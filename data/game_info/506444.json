Warning: because my C# knowledge is not the best, the game will start immediately, so be ready to Race! the game uses the normal WASD controls. Also I reccomend to play the game in fullscreen mode, that way you can see everything properly!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T06:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d01cd3ad4acb444484bc2230d3088b98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["A_Unity_Gamedev_user"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
