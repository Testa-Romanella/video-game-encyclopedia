This was our first game jam and we really enjoyed making it. Because of the time limit there is room for improvements, and we want to continue this project on the future. Also, we have put a lot of effort into it (every day we woke up early, we worked and then slept).\u00a0 The last part is a little bit too hard because we didn't had the time to test it right, but with great skills you can do it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:33:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d0/3d0298746606a8bdeb81a06ba1c0e5d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marian Madalin", "Ady26"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
