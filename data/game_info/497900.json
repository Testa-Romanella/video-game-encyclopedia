I certainly didn't get enough time to polish, which was more or less expected, but I\u00a0still think it turned out well! Honestly, the short time helped me limit my scope, which is a problem I've faced with other jams: this kinda feels more complete than other jam games I've made, frankly. Anyways, I hope you enjoy it, if even for a little bit!</p>\n<p><em>Final time for development:\u00a03 hours, 6 minutes and 54 seconds (as recorded by GMS2).</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:33:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c71/c7198e1e8927b92bbcfae7cc40f2479f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Poppers"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
