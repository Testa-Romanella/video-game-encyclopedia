{"id": 542047, "slug": "vtt-master", "name": "VTT Master", "name_original": "VTT Master", "description": "<p>VTT Master is a FREE software tool/game designed to let players get together virtually to play their tabletop games together. Currently there is a heavy bias in the game towards D&amp;D/fantasy style, games with most of the game assets reflecting this. You can create maps of various sizes, modify the terrain, place objects (houses, lamp posts, crates, barrel etc.) and paint the terrain. With a little practice, its possible to create good quality 3D maps to share with your players in a matter of minutes. There is now even a custom object option which allows you to group items together and quickly place them onto a new map to speed things up!\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game is currently in its early stages, although it is still very functional and will allow you and fellow players to get together online and play as a group.   </p>\n<p>Note that at the moment, there is a limit on the number of players that can join a game of just 2 (so this would be you as a GM and 2 others). This is whilst I perform more testing and gather feedback from people to see if any performance adjustments need to be made.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you don\u2019t want to use the game itself as the VTT, you are still able to create 3D animated battlemaps using the software to then host and import into your alternative platform.\r\n  </p>\n<p>There is also a Discord server and Patreon page available (for asking questions and, optionally, bunging some cash over!). These can be found here (Patreon) and here (Discord).</p><p>Some key features:<br/></p><ol><li>You can now create custom groups of items. For example, you might spend time laying out a market stall with fruit and veg. You can now template this group and reuse it in other maps to save time. Same applies to dungeons - if you create a large room, you can save this now and instantly place it in a new dungeon.</li><li>Hide objects from players by right clicking in edit mode and choosing the folder icon. This will make the item glow red indicating that in the multiplayer game, players wont see it until you unhide it (don't worry, it will still show up for you as GM!)</li><li>Change the weather - pressing F1 will allow you to choose from a range of weather presets, as well as change the time of day for you and all players if needed.</li><li>Basic dice roller - when hosting a game, pressing F2 will bring up the dice panel\u00a0to allow you or your players to select dice to roll on the table</li><li>Save and share maps with other users</li><li>Multiplayer functionality for you and (currently) 2 other players. I fully expect this to be increased following initial feedback on stability.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T05:41:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37c/37ce0800a54a5f8439328e211ff7eefb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Virtual DM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
