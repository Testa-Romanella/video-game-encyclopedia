Be careful not to miss a hit,\u00a0 you may not be able to turn around in time to survive!</p>\n<p>With each one of your lethal swings, the enemies spray (and some times explode into) a bloody mist of conspicuous red particles. Be careful of any enemies that may be clouded within\u00a0it!</p>\n<p>Compete amongst yourself and other in an attempt to claim the Crown (the highest possible score).</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Sword Swing - Any Key or Mouse Button (except Escape)</p>\n<p>Quit Game - Escape</p>\n\n<p>Any feedback, especially regarding the difficulty, atmosphere, and the (minor amount of) sound design present within\u00a0game, would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0\"Dead Cells -\u00a0Elite Fight\" by Yoann Laulan</p>\n<p>Animated Sprites - Luiz Melo:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/34852</p>\n<p>Castle Tile Sheet and Background - Szadi Art.:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/40094</p>\n<p>Programming and all other graphics were done by myself.</p>\n<p>- Tyler Lynch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T08:30:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/336/336f660ae2e4b460de9933645641bad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RealPersonMaybe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
