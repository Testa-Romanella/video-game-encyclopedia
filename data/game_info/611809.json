Each player has a random set of 6 cards, a tower, a wall, three types of resources and their generators.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>bricks</li><li>gems</li><li>recruits</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Resource generators (respectively):</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>quarry</li><li>magic</li><li>dungeon</li></ul>\n<p>At the beginning of each turn, the generators increase the amount of the player's corresponding resources by the current levels of these generators.\u00a0Each turn a player must use or discard one of his cards.\u00a0To use the card, a certain amount of one of the resources is required.\u00a0After using the card, it performs a combination of some actions and instead of it the player is randomly given another. Further, if the card does not prescribe otherwise, the move goes to the other player.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Card actions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>causing damage to the wall and/or tower (enemy or both the enemy and his own)</li><li>changing the amount of resources or the levels of their generators in oneself and/or the enemy</li><li>increasing your own wall and/or tower</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The rules of the game allow victory in any of the following ways:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>building your tower to the required minimum</li><li>accumulation of any resource to the required minimum</li><li>destruction of the enemy tower</li></ul>\n<p>As a rule, cards that require the same type of resources are similar in action. Gems - increase the tower, bricks - walls, animals - to deal damage to the enemy. The damage can be directed specifically at a tower or wall, or be of a general nature. In the second case, the wall takes the damage first, then the tower.<br/></p>\n<p>Since this game is in development it\u00a0has its own <strong><strong>Trello board</strong></strong> where you can follow the updates.<br/></p>\n<p>You can also support me on <strong>Buy Me a Coffee</strong>, <strong>Ko-fi</strong> or <strong>Patreon</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f4/8f49284c4a4bb576bf2ab18cc6ef27e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["DarkPro1337"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
