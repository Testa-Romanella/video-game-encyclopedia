I've worked on this game by myself from March 4th to March 10th, 2022.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS! I didn't get around to making configurations in time :(<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys: Move</li><li>Q: Move diagonally</li><li>A: Aim</li><li>E: Inventory</li><li>S: Cancel (menus)</li><li>D: Dash</li><li>Space: Attack, Select (Menus)</li></ul>\n<p>WEB OR DOWNLOAD?</p>\n<p>Web version is nice for a taste of the game, but if you like it and want to play more, I recommend downloading. The performance in the browser isn't very good and for some reason Flurret enemies in the browser version just don't want to attack you. Pacifist edition.</p>\n<p>KNOWN ISSUES</p>\n<p>Menus sometimes run into some issues, selecting options in the wrong order. I'll see about patching that after the jam deadline.<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS<br/></p>\n<p>This game uses the Karcero dungeon generation algorithm. https://github.com/odedw/karcero</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it uses this port of A* https://gist.github.com/stylophone/3448727</p>\n<p>As well as fonts from this pack https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/fonts/pixel-fonts-megapack-65958</p>\n<p>For purposes of the jam format I also feel like I should note that the designs (not sprites) of some characters and the title screen and bog themes were not made during the jam period. All remaining scripts, sprites, sounds and systems were developed during the jam by yours truly.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T12:08:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c7/3c701c877669b0552f0141d147e07098.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Enjl"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
