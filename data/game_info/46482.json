Dodge, weave, spin, shoot. Use a planet's gravity for a speed slingshot, or draw your pursuer into a fatal collision with an explosive asteroid. This is real gameplay, dependent on reactions and skilful execution on every device it's played on.<br/><br/>Tactical gameplay through design-your-own-shipsDesign the perfect vessels to conquer/save the universe, selecting from components in millions of combinations to balance fire-power, manoeuvrability and cost to fit your play style and the current level challenges, whether that's direct combat or using environmental hazards to your advantage.<br/><br/>Classic '90s space-game flavouringInspired by the great 1990s space games such as Master of Orion, Ascendancy, and of course Star Control, ionAXXIA indulges in the same delight of varied tech and gobbledegook sci-fi jargon. As well as the typical blasters and laser beams, expect cluster-missiles, gravity wells, and maybe a few 'antimatter cones' and 'space limpits'.<br/><br/>Easy pick-up-and-play gamingionAXXIA is designed around short bouts so you can get a decent game when you've just got a few minutes to kill, or blow an afternoon perfecting your skills and levelling your components. A wealth of alternative control options also bring a simpler interface so you can be sure to find a way to play on your Windows tablet/phone that suits your tastes.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab8/ab869d492a32cda98edb1eb2eb2ea112.jpg", "website": "https://www.softwaregeezers.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Software Geezers"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Software Geezers"], "esrb_rating": null}
