Two forces try to reach a fragile harmony.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this 2D puzzle game, you control two characters at once: Yin and Yang. With space-like physics that give you very little control, influence the two entities to come as close to each other as possible, without casting their light upon one another.</p>\n<p>This game was made all by my lonesome\u00a0in 48H for the United Game Jam 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The theme for the jam was \"Two.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>With Yin &amp; Yang, I wanted to dive into a mechanic where, like the symbol, two characters have to work together without killing each other, always keeping the balance intact. The theme would be represented by the 2-character mechanic, but also with two lights, two areas, etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, I could not go with a full Black &amp; White art direction as the renderer I chose to use was not able to cast a dark, negative light\u00a0which would dim the other bright light (or at least, I\u00a0couldn't figure that part out).\u00a0However with a little digging and rearranging, I think the paper art style goes well and allows for better clarity in the gameplay.</p>\n<p>Started learning game development 3 months ago, this\u00a0is my second released game and first game jam.\u00a0 It was an incredible experience, and I hope you enjoy the game at least half as much as I enjoyed making it.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Engine:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Unity 2019.3.15f1 with Universal Render Pipeline.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Art Assets:</strong></p>\n<p><em>UI Pack by Kenney</em> -\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack</p>\n<p><em>Particle Pack by Kenney</em> -\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/particle-pack</p>\n<p><em>Controller Prompts Pack by xelu</em> -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/free-keyboard-and-controllers-prompts-pack</p>\n<p><em>Paper by darkwood</em> -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/paper</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Kennel NL Impact Sounds</em> -\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/impact-sounds</p>\n\n<p><strong>Soundtrack:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Wuxia2_Guzheng_Pipa by PeriTune</em> |\u00a0http://peritune.com\u00a0 |\u00a0<em>Music promoted by\u00a0</em>https://www.free-stock-music.com\u00a0 |\u00a0<em>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\u00a0</em>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Fonts:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Yozakura by Kotonoha Kuju</em> -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/yozakura.font?l[]=10&amp;l[]=1</p>\n<p><em>A Annyeong Haseyo by wep</em> -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/a-annyeong-haseyo.font?l[]=10&amp;l[]=1</p>\n<p><em>Bonzai</em> -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/bonzai.font</p>\n\n<p><strong>Logo:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Yin Yang Symbol by Piotr Siedlecki</em> -\u00a0https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=196877&amp;picture=yin-yang-symbol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3ca14c3c394dde7758edbc402767ad7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NamidaSai"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
