I know it isn\u2019t anything really amazing, but please check out my other games that I put more time into. Those will have much better quality and you will likely have much more fun with those.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/978/9788b2f4dd20b904dbad9c4484e90815.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wood Chip Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
