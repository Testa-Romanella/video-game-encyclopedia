Having plants, going for a walk in the park, or even looking at a landscape poster could produce psychological benefits, reduce stress, and improve concentration.</p>\n<p>Based on several experimental studies, the presence of potted plants has been found to be helpful in many different settings including work, school, and hospitals. In particular, plants have been shown to:</p>\n<ul><li>Lower blood pressure (systolic)</li><li>Improve reaction times</li><li>Increase attentiveness</li><li>Improve attendance (at work and school)</li><li>Raise productivity\u00a0(at work)</li><li>Improve well-being</li><li>Improve perceptions of the space</li><li>Lower levels of anxiety during recovery from surgery</li><li>Raise job satisfaction</li></ul>\n<p>Most of the studies on the effects of houseplants have compared the presence of plants to their absence. While this is the epitome of a well-designed experiment, there might be other factors associated with the presence of plants--but not the plants themselves--that account for the more favorable results. For example, the improvement could be due to distraction, novelty, caring for something, perceived control, or improved air quality. Thus, we might get similar results under different circumstances, such as replacing the plants with a dartboard, photos, Sea Monkeys, or an air purifier. So, it's important to keep in mind that other additions to your space might also be helpful.</p>\n<p>The research suggests that having plants around you is a good thing for your health and productivity. So, if you're feeling stressed or inefficient at work, get a plant. You might just feel better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:43:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cf/8cf46c7755d559030c69737921501432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rpmoura"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
