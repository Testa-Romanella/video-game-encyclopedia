Battle over a bunker, wage war in the woodlands, or raise hell on the rooftops!<br/></li><li><strong>Several Whole Weapons</strong> - We've got your machine guns, your rocket launchers, the fan favourite noobtube, we talking raygun, a giant finger, a throwable trashcan, you name it and we will probably add it.<br/></li><li><strong>Cheap &amp; Free SFX</strong> - Literally mashed up free and paid audio asset packs to get something that feels juuuuuust alright.<br/></li><li><strong>Absurd Abilities</strong> - Just a mix of weird and wonderful perks that are mostly helpful most of the time. Fart your way to safety, or build Trump's wall.<br/></li><li><strong>Tart Up Your Balls</strong> - With so many Countryballs to choose from, represent your corner of this flat earth in a style that suits you, or offends everyone else.<br/></li><li><strong>Award Winning Music</strong> - Somehow convinced an award-winning composer to make the theme track, still no idea how or why, but we are grateful anyway!<br/></li><li><strong>Mostly Finished Menus</strong> - I mean, they work, you can navigate and play the game, what more do you want?<br/></li><li><strong>Designed by Talentless Hacks</strong> - This means we have tried to make it balanced, with consideration, and purpose.

None of That Loot Box Shit Tho</strong> - but if you pay into our offshore bank account, you'll get instant win abilities and big bonus balls.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T07:58:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fe/3fe31ab06e3a2d9a0ec21bc6581b7257.jpg", "website": "http://modernballfare.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mildly Professional"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mildly Professional"], "esrb_rating": null}
