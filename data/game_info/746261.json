This game has a bug so it freezes after tutorial or after start. I tried to submit a fix in the grace period, but the chat bugged out. You can play a working version here: https://agrerim.itch.io/paranoid-escape2\u00a0 for fun but voting for the game jam should, unfortunately, be done for this very incomplete version.</p><p>\"<em>It's a conspiracy which put you here in the first place. Surely they can read your mind...</em>\"\r\n  </p>\n<p>Paranoid Escape is a top-down stealth game where you try to escape a mental hospital. The twist is you get more insane for each level and start imagining compulsions, restrictions, and hallucinations.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Paranoid Escape was created for\u00a0Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1 with the theme \"It is not real\". Due to time constraints there is a very limited number of \"Paranoia Cards\", but it's a prototype.</p>\n<p><em>Created by Rasmus and Per using Unity Engine.
