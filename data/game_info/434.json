(armament refinement mobile systems)<br/>- Mechs, Tanks, Ships and Motherships can be upgraded with: health, armor, mobility speed, attack power, attack speed and visibility<br/>- You can have up to 10 upgrade slots maximum so it is important that you upgrade your units strategically towards your game play style<br/><br/>**************************<br/>TIPS<br/>**************************<br/>- Use class 1 mechs to collect AP from the green crystals. You can pile mechs on a patch of crystals to speed up your AP collection.<br/>- Build units quickly and take over as many green crystal patches to out gain your opponents.<br/>- Mechs are low cost in AP to create so they are good against shooting down ships.<br/>- Tanks are good at destroying land units with splash damage. They hold up well against a fleet of mechs.<br/>- Ships are good at taking out tanks since tanks cannot shoot at ships.<br/>- Use your Mothership! Move your Mothership closer to the front line so you can deploy units into battle quickly.<br/>- Use a variety of units in a group to complement each of their strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>**************************<br/>Trouble Shooting<br/>**************************<br/>If you have any issues with the game please email us at info@jumpthestream.com and we will be glad to help you.
