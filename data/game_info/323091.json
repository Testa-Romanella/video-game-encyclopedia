{"id": 323091, "slug": "starbase", "name": "Starbase", "name_original": "Starbase", "description": "<p>Starbase is a massively multiplayer online game with gameplay focused on building and designing spaceships and stations, exploration, resource gathering, crafting, trading, and combat. Alternatively the game features a sandbox mode where players can explore the game alone or with selected friends in their own universe.<br />\nSet in a universe of vast scale and detail, the fully-destructible environment and hybrid voxel/vertex-based game mechanics enable simulations in the game at immense depth; minor collisions may break a few outer plates from your spaceship, while fast-speed crashes can rip the ship apart. Thruster propellant pipe leaks may cause spaceships to stall, but the corrosive, leaking propellant might also melt the superstructure of the ship and cause a catastrophic failure. Damaged ship controls in a spaceship do not necessarily mean the journey is over, as manual values for the flight can be applied directly to the generator and thrusters from the engine room.<br />\nThe scale and depth of the simulation in all aspects of the game gives players the ultimate freedom to exploit their innovativeness and creativity \u2013 the building blocks of success in Starbase. From constructing single spaceships with durable outer plating to creating massive automated factories and designing electricity and data networks, the players are free to do it their own way<br />\nDestructible environment with voxel and fracture damage and in-depth simulationThe environment in Starbase is fully destructible, meaning everything can be destroyed or disassembled with the right kind of tools and weaponry.<br />\nThe in-depth physics simulation enabled by hybrid voxel/vertex-based game mechanics make fights, exploration and flying spaceships more creative and fun and the simulation of structural and elemental durability in the game adds its own twist and challenge to the efforts to conquer space; poorly designed superstructures combined with overpowered steering thrusters can snap the spaceships in half if cutting corners too much in a space race.Play and interact online with thousands of players, join factions, and moreStart shaping the Starbase universe with fellow robots by joining and working for factions.<br />\nBuild,fight, chat and group up with other players to discover and settle the vast galaxy that is waiting for its first conquerors to make their mark.<br />\nMine asteroids by yourself, trade and haul cargo with your friends, or build a capital station with a huge company.<br />\nTake part in the battle between the Empire and the Kingdom, or leisurely explore the galaxy while the insurance system has you covered should you accidentally wander into uncharted space.<br />\nSuccess in Starbase is not measured in hours played or an endless grind, but in the ingenuity of each player and their ability to work together.<br />\nBuild and design your spaceship, stations and devices down to the tiniest detailThe smallest building unit in Starbase is a single bolt, allowing you to build, repair and modify spaceships, stations, and devices as you wish.<br />\nEven the smallest ships have thousands of parts, each with their own detailed damage model, making building and designing a truly creative process.<br />\nLearning to use the in-game programming chips will take building and designing to a new level; innovation, automation of ships and creating clever ship layouts will make all the difference!<br />\nExplore the infinite universe and gather resourcesExplore the vast universe to discover stations, social hubs and new raw materials.<br />\nArrange an exploration mission with friends and find out what the universe has to offer.<br />\nTravel to an asteroid field to mine raw minerals and salvage different materials from broken ships, trade materials at trading stations or steal from others if that floats your (space)boat.About Starbase<br />\nStarbase is developed with Frozenbyte\u2019s internal game engine that is custom-built for conquering space, enabling the use of extremely challenging combination of voxel and vertex technologies in the game. The modern engine has been built specifically with Starbase in mind and the engine\u2019s architecture is designed to handle all the quirks of simulation, damage, building, player amounts and the ever-growing universe to match the challenges the ambitious vision of the game can pose. Similarly, all features of the game have been developed with the infinite scale and the creative freedom of the players in mind.<br />\nStarbase has been in secret development for five years without restraints and the development will continue until the game\u2019s bold vision is achieved. In the ever-expanding space the scale can range from the unit of one bolt to massive space station structures, with exploration missions varying from journeys to nearby asteroid fields, to salvaging ship debris, and eventually to other galaxies.<br />\nIn Starbase players are given the freedom to build the kind of universe they want to, and a small group of players can eventually form large factions that challenge the powers that be. Being inventive will also help, as cleverness often triumphs over brute force in Starbase, and the only limitation is the creativity of the players.Early Access<br />\nStarbase Early Access will introduce the players, the pioneers, to a new galaxy that they can begin to explore from a bunch of huge stations, the Mega Stations, located at the orbit of a single planet. As the players eventually settle the entire orbit, they can start finding ways to travel to the planet\u2019s moons and someday all the way to other planets and distant star systems. The still unoccupied universe of Starbase offers players the chance to take part in the building of the galaxy and in discovering what will be the first steps in the twilight of space travel.<br />\nEarly Access allows the players to explore, buy and modify spaceships, form social connections and to earn money by gathering and selling resources. The players can start building their home stations at the Mega Station and begin the exploration and creation of the Starbase universe together with the developers.<br />\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/454120/Starbase/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-28T23:56:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/227ea8d5bca2847f6d250e8693cfaf3b.jpg", "website": "https://www.starbasegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 58, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 10, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frozenbyte"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Frozenbyte"], "esrb_rating": null}
