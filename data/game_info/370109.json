However, there is only a \"Single Point of Entry\" on each floor, to go to the floor below - an elevator - and it's heavily guarded. The game is made harder by the important rule: No Killing Allowed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T06:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ea/1ea1a4842d6a7ae99e956e436ac3a480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KrishnaJawale"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
