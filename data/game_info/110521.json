Pretty much all you can do is walk. The animation of the few interactive elements is not great at best. It's more of an atmosphere test rather than a game at this state.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I put Kintsugi together in mid-to-late 2016 while processing some emotional things. The intended message is that things may be bad, but there's hope. Things can be repaired. The hurt can be stitched together into hope. The stitches may be ugly, but they'll keep you dry in the rain. <br/><br/>A perpetual walk through the woods is just as poignant in its own way...<br/><br/>@mattpetrak</p>\n\n<p><strong>Made with\u00a0\u2764 by</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Some unused assets that never got animated &amp; implemented.
