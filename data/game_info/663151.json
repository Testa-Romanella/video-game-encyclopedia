If touch grey square, die.<br/><br/>In all seriousness, this is my first attempt at creating a game, and I'm more or less just creating this page to make it easier to share with friends. I followed Brackeys' tutorial on how to make a game in unity, but I added 7 more levels, and decided to make them noticeably harder than Brackeys' three.\u00a0 Enjoy!<br/><br/>Ps.
