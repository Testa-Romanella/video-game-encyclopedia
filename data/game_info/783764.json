Play solo or couch co-op with a friend, searching through the puzzling wasteland in a never-ending battle to get the high score on 12 separate in-game mode combinations. In time attack, you (or you and a friend in co-op) have only 180 seconds to wreak as much havoc as possible. Play on three different board sizes, each with their own wacky strengths and weaknesses.  With a riveting choice of Classical or Jazz soundtracks, you'll be humming along for hours in this addictive falling-block puzzler! If you love dropping blocks and making crush, you'll love Amshay!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T05:02:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72d/72d1622e3f02ae202e332baad0ad3a90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["bankbank"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wainstop James"], "esrb_rating": null}
