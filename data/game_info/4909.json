Joining forces, our five mechanical heroes, Spad, Cosmo, Bruce, Helmut and Monk, build a spacecraft and outwit their guards as they escape from their iron prison. Their jailers' master, the vile Yagor, swears to hunt them down and rip them apart piece by piece.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAboard the S-Pace, our five friends journey across a universe teeming with danger and scrap-iron mercenaries, intent on putting an end to Yagor's tyrannical reign.
