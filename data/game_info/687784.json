How about the dreams where you are running away from something? Let's combine those two and turn you into a walking and jumping eye ball named Iris!\u00a0Welcome to Halloween Fall where you try to avoid death for as long as possible!<br/><br/>This is one of my personal favorites that has come from doing these assignments. I love the feel I was able to create with the little time I\u00a0had to make the assets and the small bit of animation I applied to Iris.</p>\n<p>What would take this to the next step is a good dose of particle effects, some parallaxing background images and a spookier color palette to really sell the SPOOK factor!</p>\n<p>If you want to see more personal projects in the future make sure you follow!</p>\n<p><em>Best Played Out of Fullscreen</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>This project is the result of completing an assignment for Game Development I at the University of Central Missouri.
