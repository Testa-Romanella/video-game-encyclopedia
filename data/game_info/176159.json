Trying to keep it as close to the classic verison as much as possible as far as the controls/inventory. \u00a0This game will not have any ripped stuff from any of the former or current RE\u00a0games. Everything is remade from love,\u00a0\u00a0based on the idea, \u00a0from the Capcom Resident Evil 1. Give it a shot and leave some feedback!</p>\n<p>Note: No downloads needed at this time.
