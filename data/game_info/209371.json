Z again to start game.</p>\n<p>Game:\u00a0Move mouse (default)\u00a0or use L/R arrow keys to rotate ship. Z to thrust (note that you can travel in that direction at that speed indefinitely once you are moving).</p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>Every time you are near a planet, a line will guide you to it. (Or to the nearest planet if there are several.)</p>\n<p>Every time you pass over a planet, you might collect resources from the detritus floating around it - fuel, minerals, or both. The fuel will keep you going longer. Minerals are just for bragging rights. Planets are also marked with a V for 'visited'.</p>\n<p>Try to visit as many planets and collect as many minerals as you can before running out of fuel.</p>\n<p>If you're really lucky the speed and direction you're travelling when you run out of fuel will take you over a planet that has fuel, and you can continue on, but you can also give up if you don't want to wait and see.</p>\r\nCommentary\r\n<p>Finally did a Big Thing (or a relatively Big Thing) with my vector line drawing stuff in PICO-8. I am calling this mess 8STROKE and will probably make more games with it in future, although maybe not for a while because this was a lot of work. Nonetheless I\u00a0am getting in on time and with plenty of nice-to-haves done! Very happy.</p>\n<p>Lexaloffle BBS thread: here.</p>\n<p>#1GAM March 2018</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/932/932b68c6679841aa3f55d9a0bdb3c754.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
