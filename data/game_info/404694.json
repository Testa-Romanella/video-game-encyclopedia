I still am, but with a ton of work and help from the right peopleI managed to complete this work in the alloted time.</p>\n<p>This game exists as a form of standard pong, with the towers, income, and increasing difficulty mechanics of a tower defence game. This is a primarily two-player experience, however there is a rudimentary (and often unfair) vs AI mode included.</p>\n<p>Due to my relative amateurism at making games, I did not have time to implement all of the features I had planned, however feedback is welcomed on the game as it stands.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks for playing. Enjoy!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T02:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f355cf3c2bbec7db5dab49aa0f7b84e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bersekrer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
