It makes use of tons of pre-made assets in an effort to show that talent is an asset---that an interesting product can be made from pre-made assets.</p>\n<p>With that idea in mind, I decided to work in an area I've never worked in before---3d. Because of the advantage given by using pre-made assets, I was able to put together a product in a short amount of time, even though I lacked experience in the area. For example, the pre-made hand assets let me learn a little bit about 3d animation---an incredibly difficult skill.</p>\n<p>Competition Announcement<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game centers around a man working to finish some spreadsheets for his boss while all around him spiders gather.</p>\n<p>The game is more of an interactive horror story with an emphasis on a feeling of growing dread.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b7808e69c422e817f1aa8042bb6ca60e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["tallshrimp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
