The game is currently in Beta.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are granted a dejected piece of land in the forest to attract the the world's monster girls. Clear your land, upgrade your tools, craft new decorations, and more! Attract visitors, \"convince\" them to stay, battle and breed them with others to create the strongest, or sexiest possible girl.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce you've attracted a new monster and convinced them to stay it's time to train them up. Monster girls do what they want and it's hard to control them, they will wander the garden and do what they feel like. Currently the game allows you to assign Commands right from the start, but in future updates this will require raising their 'Loyalty' stat. Loyalty shows how much your monster likes you, and is a reflection of how well you are treating them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlenty of animations and scenes will be added as the game expands over time. Girls have a lust stat which raises over time and must be satisfied. If they can't find a willing partner they may engage a not so willing monster, or deal with it themselves. Or you can always switch to Player Mode and help them out yourself! Player Mode allows you to explore your Garden in 3rd person and interact with your Monsters ;)<br/>\r\nSome monsters have alternate skins which can be unlocked, and more will be added in future updates.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T11:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a4/4a4aa803e416f2d6b3c0d40f621da1e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noxious Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Shady Corner Games", "Noxious Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
