Each time you choose correctly, you get a point. It's that simple.<br/><br/>Just a daft highscore chaser, but it's not as easy as it looks.<br/><br/>Code and graphics: Me<br/>Music, Music player and additional graphics: Vanja Utne.<br/></p><p>This game can be downloaded for free, but if you would like to donate, that's cool. When the pool reaches $100 it will go to charity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T06:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b70/b70bd7b3b95dea2a968d6b5de5774855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roysterini"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
