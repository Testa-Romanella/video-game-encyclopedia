The Valor Valley game mode is the best way to earn Faction Points. <br/><br/><strong>SvS (Squad vs. Squad)</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul> <li> If you are captured; the UNC use you, a rebel prisoner, as entertainment. They will force you to fight against other rebels in a 5v5 Team Deathmatch, dubbed Squad vs Squad. </li></ul><h3>American Alliance Factions</h3>Ally yourself with one of three factions in-game and on Discord.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <ul><li> Black Foxes<br/>\t        Covering the North-Western region of their beloved land, the Black Foxes are a close knit group of resistance fighters. Although small in land cover, they are large in numbers. Heavily relying on Guerilla tactics, the Black Foxes use densely populated forests and the Rocky Mountains to their advantage. Using infantry-only tactics, the UNC convoys make easy targets. <br/><br/>                Culture<br/>                With a hard heart, comes a steady mind. The Black Foxes are sly in behavior and untrustworthy of newcomers. Communication/trading is done with caution, and supervised extensively while done.<br/><br/> </li><li> United Militias<br/>                 Derived from the South-East, the United Militia has the largest coastline of all three factions. Although they are in agreement with their tactics, the diverse landscape proves difficult in traversing war fronts. Torid humidity and the various terrains keeps the UNC on their toes, giving the United Militia time to rally. <br/><br/>             Culture<br/>                 Albeit productive in their cause, they are notorious for being non-provocative. The United Militia are trustworthy in their dealings, yet suspicious externally. Outsiders are welcome, respect isn\u2019t guaranteed. Communication/trading is done with ease, due to their navy capacity. Uniformity in their oligarchic ways, proves fierce in the heat of battle.<br/><br/> </li><li> Desert Deviants<br/>                 Spanning across the South Western expansion of the once-known United States, the Desert Deviants have the greatest crop, but are few and far in-between. Unlike other factions, they do not rely on Guerilla tactics due to minimal cover, scorching dry-lands and freezing nights. Rather, they use their environment to the best advantage against the UNC, well-known for their inability to \u2018dress\u2019 themselves. The Desert Deviants are well known for their hard hits. Systemically, interactive democracy is practiced for all decisions.<br/> <br/>             Culture<br/>                 Although a tough group of individuals, they are known for their habitual mercy. They are experimental in their warfare and disagree largely on their tactics. Ideally, they base their interactions/trading Quid Pro Quo. </li></ul><h3>United Nation Coalition Factions</h3>The three occupying forces that have formed to occupy American territories.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <ul><li> Goryeo<br/>\t        Based off of a Korean kingdom in the 10th century, Goryeo is the  first westernmost faction in the UNC that the player encounters. <br/><br/> </li><li> Zhong Xing<br/>                 Translated as 'Holy-Middle', Zhong Xing is the second and middle faction that the player encounters. <br/><br/> </li><li> Novvy Vostok<br/>                 Translated as 'New-East', Novvy Vostok is the third and easternmost faction that the player encounters. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73c/73cfd58375dfd8a75d595c7379c96608.jpg", "website": "https://www.onedawnstudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One Dawn Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["One Dawn Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
