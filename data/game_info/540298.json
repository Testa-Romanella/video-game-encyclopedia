As such, it is small and simple, but it is the first program I've made which I think holds a good enough standard to be widely distributed.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in a fictional version of Copenhagen which is inhabited by anthropomorphic rats instead of humans. Recently, a deadly disease has taken hold of the city, infecting many of its inhabitants. A short while before their demise, they will turn into blood-thirsty cannibals, attacking anyone not infected with the pathogen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scientists have worked day and night to produce a cure and have just found it, but they've also run out of the\u00a0raw material needed to synthesize more of it. The needed ingredient is a common herb, but it is extremely dangerous to go outside, due to the roving infected. Thus, a message has been sent out to anyone brave enough to gather a sample and bring it to the national laboratories.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You control the heroic \"Birch Rat\", a brave civilian who has answered the call. You've ventured out into the city with nothing more than a back-pack and a pistol to face the maniac hordes and collect enough herbs for production of an initial batch of the vaccine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has only one level, in which you must collect all 9 available samples of herbs spread out across it. As soon as you collect the last one, you've won (you'll get airlifted out by a helicopter on stand-by).\u00a0You can shoot and throw grenades\u00a0in any direction regardless of which way you're going. You can leap on top of cars and ride on their roofs for as long as you want (but they turn randomly at every intersection). You can also eat chocolate to boost your running speed for a short while.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you beat the game, your time will be recorded and displayed under the difficulty level you beat it at. I have still to beat it in \"hard\" mode, but my times for \"easy\" and \"normal\" are included for you as a challenge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game comes with a level-editor, the same one I\u00a0used to make its one level. In the main menu, you can choose to play the original or the edited level. Initially, they will be nearly identical, but you can modify the \"edited\" level as much as you want, creating new challenges for yourself or your friends. Lastly, you can modify the difficulty further with some \"gameplay options\" such as enemy speed, enemy attack damage etc.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Copenhagen Crisis\u00a0has plenty of shortcomings, and that's why it's free. But as I write this (7th of January 2021) I am in the process of creating the first game for which I intend to charge a price. Publishing Copenhagen Crisis here is a sort of trial for when that program is ready.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T03:58:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b168ce7d1f754b937d6bdda825435762.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The_Digi_Mage"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
