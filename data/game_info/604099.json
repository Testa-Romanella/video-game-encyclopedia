We really wanted to bring that experience into mobile gaming world while incorporating survival game elements from modern mobile games. We set out an ambitious goal of creating a game that is a new form of hybrid game that wasn't widely available on the market. New systems were created to bridge that gap between PC and mobile. This included our team making dozens of prototypes to address RTS controls on mobile, the end result is an intuitive gesture control mechanic allowing the game to achieve traditional RTS-like feeling on a smartphone. We tried staying true to form of a traditional PC-based RTS games of simultaneous multi-unit controls, resource management, micro-management battle system with modern survival game elements such as item crafting and meta-game upgrades. We hope the end product is a truly unique mobile game that breaks the mould of current set mobile game genres.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T04:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2f/a2fab2bf1f2bef34e80ae3e95030400c_cGUkB9G.jpg", "website": "https://www.seasungames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Seasun Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Seasun Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
