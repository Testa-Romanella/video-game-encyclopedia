Press space to try again! How long can you last?<br/></p>\n<p>I thought it was finally time to make and release my first video game. We all start somewhere! Although hilariously rough, I shall refine this game so its isn't just a prototype!<br/><br/>I've uploaded PIG STICKER for both Windows and Mac OSX.<br/><br/>Anyway, its just a bit of fun and I'm already making a small\u00a0 first person exploration game next!<br/><br/>Jono<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Where else you can find me online... <br/>Patreon - www.patreon.com/jononotbono <br/>Personal Website - www.jononotbono.com <br/>Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/jono_not_bono <br/>Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/jononotbono <br/>Discord - https://discord.gg/U27dcdbR <br/>Soundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/lukejohnsoniow\u00a0<br/>Facebook: - https://www.facebook.com/Drjononotbono <br/>Twitter - https://twitter.com/jono_not_bono <br/>TikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@jononotbono</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T12:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d0/7d0f254366c692e8db542d5d4d1a44c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["jononotbono"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
