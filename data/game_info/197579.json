It\u2019s entirely controlled by the mouse.

Apologies for the lack of a Bytt cameo, didn\u2019t have the time to put it in either, admittedly. A Davis cameo will have to suffice.</p>\n<p>Lemme know what you guys think about it, and if this should be a post jam thing that I should actually finish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dd/8dd8d66806aab746cd683aa804eccde2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Impossible Realms"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
