Aggressive, intelligent plants took over the world (?). Faced with this new and bizarre reality, Lou decides it\u2019s much better to stay inside as much as possible, to avoid the plants and the people they control and puppet. <br/><br/>Lou at least has an unseen friend she communicates with via radio, though they have one rule:\u00a0\u201cwe must never meet in person, in case one of us becomes a slave the the plants.\u201d</em><br/><em>However, one day\u2014</em>\n<p><strong>Characters:</strong></p>\r\nLou:<br/><br/>The player character. Slightly gloomy and high-strung, but not unfriendly. She\u2019s mostly a recluse, leaving her fenced-in house only when she needs to.<br/><br/>Estrella: <br/><br/>The girl on the other side of the walkie talkie. Nearly the opposite of Lou in demeanor, they get along surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Lou\u2019s sister: She ??? a while back.<br/><br/>Afflicted: People controlled by the plants.
