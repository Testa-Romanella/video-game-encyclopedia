Get as high a score as possible and submit it. Don't let the circles fall off the screen or they will be lost forever.</p><p>\r\n\tDrag using the left mouse button to different circles from the hub. If unconnected they will fall off the screen. Try to lose as few as possible. Circles change colour throughout the game and disconnect, so make sure to keep an eye on them.<br/><br/>Link to the website for this game.</p><p>Music by Sarah Hargreaves</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be8/be8b0c6042356f6623145a667bee49d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Slowpoke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
