{"id": 302307, "slug": "tale-in-the-desert-a", "name": "A Tale in the Desert", "name_original": "A Tale in the Desert", "description": "<p>The ancient Egyptians wrote about Seven Disciplines of Man: Leadership, Thought, The Human Body, Architecture, Worship, Conflict, and Art. They believed that if a man could achieve perfection in all seven, he&#39;d live forever. A Tale in the Desert centers around the tests, which measure your skill in the seven disciplines. They don&#39;t measure your character&#39;s abilities --- they measure your abilities. That&#39;s a big difference. For example, to advance in leadership, you&#39;ll actually need to be able to convince people to do things. To advance in conflict, you&#39;ll need real tactical and strategic ability. To advance in art, you&#39;ll need artistic talent. All of the tests share one thing in common: your goal is to affect your fellow players. In conflict, you must defeat them. In architecture, you must outbuild them. In worship, you must coordinate them. No matter the discipline, passing a test revolves around other players.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2003-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T10:31:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c51/c51139bda758d5cd2ac2b7b6aa3fa544.jpg", "website": "http://atitd.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 473, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eGenesis"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["eGenesis"], "esrb_rating": null}
