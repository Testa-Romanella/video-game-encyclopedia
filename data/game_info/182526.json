And first time releasing a game in Unity!<br/>I was actually going to make this game in my own engine, but I got a project going that will use Unity, so I decided to practice it in LD!<br/><br/>This entry was actually pretty hard for me to make, I was really tired, a lot of setbacks... BUT I manage to overcome all my obstacles and finished the game!</p><p>It's not perfect and I don't think it's a winner (not that I actually compete in LD), but I'm actually happy with the result! Learned a lot too making this game!<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy playing it! And remember to comment so I can play your game too!!<br/><br/>Congratulations to all!!</p><p>/***************************************************************************/ <br/> <br/>Announcements: <br/>- I posted a walkthrough, in case you didn't have the patience to beat it!
