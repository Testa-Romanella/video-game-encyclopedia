{"id": 789132, "slug": "meteor-souls", "name": "Meteor Souls", "name_original": "Meteor Souls", "description": "<p><strong>[Proof of concept demo inspired by Megaman Battle Network x Elden Ring, with a roguelike gameplay loop]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow Keys: Move the hero\r\n</li><li>Space or tap the WAIT button: Skip your turn (and gain stamina)</li><li>1,2,3,4 or Tap:\u00a0Play a card in your hand\r\n</li><li>Tap a health potion (red) or mana potion (blue) to restore the corresponding resource</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Objective</strong></p>\n<p>Defeat your oponent before they defeat you!</p>\n<p>Play cards by paying the stamina cost (green) or mana cost (blue). Moving also costs 1 stamina. You can skip your turn (press space) to restore some stamina.</p>\n<p>Health and potions don't restore between battles automatically - you'll have to spend souls to\u00a0rest between battles.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Getting Stronger</strong></p>\n<p>After you're victorious, you'll earn souls that you can spend on attributes. Attributes like Strength and Dexterity improve the damage of your abilities, while Vigor and Mind will increase your health and mana respectively.</p>\n<p>After battle, you'll earn a pack of 3 cards to add to your side board. Spend souls on attributes will grant you additional cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Deck Management</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your deck has 8 cards in it. After battle, you can drag cards from your side board (the bottom card list) into your deck (the top 8 cards) to swap.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<p>The game is mostly playable on mobile, but with an important note - the 'Roll' card won't work, and there may be other issues. I recommend playing on a desktop browser for now, but you can at least check out the game on mobile if you prefer.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is buggy, imbalanced and rough. I'd love to get feedback on the concept in general - if it's deep enough, interesting enough, etc... I welcome any and all comments here on Itch, or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/slothwerks)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T19:45:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/083/083039778bd6b37c6be5bafe74f41d99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Slothwerks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
