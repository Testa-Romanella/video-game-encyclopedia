I made her for my senior project at Stetson University in the Digital Arts major. I did all of the art, writing, coding, etc. Everything but the music! Which was done by Vindsvept on Youtube &lt;3.<br/><br/>Merry March is a lighthearted fantasy visual novel featuring an entirely queer and autistic cast. It follows Margot as she receives a mysterious letter promising her help if she just goes to these three places and meets those people there. She meets Lyn, Eden, and eventually Oreste.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much to anyone who plays it, I really appreciate it. She's a child of love, but a very rough child for sure. A labor of love and learning how to use ren'py and coding for the first time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T10:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/278/2780e6e6a8e9807de3282b7b91fdcfb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itsamoray"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
