But trying to get out and live life to the fullest is difficult, especially when others keep trying to drag you into your own problems, everyone around you says you're useless, and you have your own self doubts to contend with.</p>\n<p>Killing Ouroboros is a linear visual novel that also has an escape room section at the very end. It's fairly short, about 2-4 hours depending on how fast you read and how good at puzzles you are. It's a very personal project that I've been working on for the past two years. I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T13:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2df8bf2cd163bcbe434f0715372f3807.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkeletonMob"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
