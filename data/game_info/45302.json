You have a goalie glove in your left hand, a stick and blocker in your right hand, and pads that are set on the ground where you should be. Try to score on the computer goalie, but beware, the puck will shoot back at any time. Always be ready to face a shot and keep it out of your net. 366 fans will be watching you two try to score on each other. Choose a goal horn to play when somebody scores. <br/>\r\nThe pause menu will keep track of the number of shots you have faced/taken. It also records your save %. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFree pdates to this game will happen to allow the game to grow. Any suggestions to the game will be accepted and read by me, the developer. Have fun and score some goals!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/483/483e2497740b070e94980a62e3d72f3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carson Lougheed"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Carson Lougheed"], "esrb_rating": null}
