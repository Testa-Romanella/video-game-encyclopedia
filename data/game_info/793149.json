{"id": 793149, "slug": "slimeagedon-man-vs-slime", "name": "Slimeagedon: Man vs Slime", "name_original": "Slimeagedon: Man vs Slime", "description": "<p>Slimeagedon is a first-person movement based brawler, set in a world where slimes have overrun earth, and it is your job as the last remaining human to punch them back into extinction using only your firsts. The only objective is to get to the end goal at every level, marked by a checkered flag. Standing in your way are slimes of all different shapes and sizes. You are expected to die, a lot. As a tradeoff, the game is structured into bite-sized levels that take roughly 2 minutes to complete, each getting progressively harder and more elaborate as you trudge forward. You can punch/uppercut slimes, as well as dash mid-air by pressing shift.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T18:15:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b7/8b76220239e7f9f5bf79eb84b8c952e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AM1040245"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
