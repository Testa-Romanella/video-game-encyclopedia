Can you kill them all? No, but try to survive as long as possible. You can control time tho, so in case you die, you can revert back.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move, LMB to shoot, R to revert time (only up to 10 seconds), Space to fast forward time. Backspace to reset<br/></p>\n<p>The game was made from scratch in Rust using my own engine, which apparently has some bug with looping sound, so I removed the thruster sound of the spaceship and the buzzing sound of enemies<br/></p>\n<p>Game's source code can be found here: https://github.com/kuviman/trijam121<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T06:43:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68c/68c2fdaedc398e2e8111b7c79adfcbd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["kuviman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
