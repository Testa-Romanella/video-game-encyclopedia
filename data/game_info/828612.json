There are a few things that work in a way that wasn't intended and a few quality of life features that don't work at all. I'm really sorry about that, I've spent the majority of the jam time trying to fix them but honestly I'd rather have a playable but unpolished game than nothing at all.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy anyway :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T04:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a451ef1893b52837ec42abeaebb764fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["beetBlocks"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
