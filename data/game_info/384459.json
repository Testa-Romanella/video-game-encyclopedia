(Heck, I wasn't even close this time) But I figured I'd stick with it and turn it into something.</p>\n<p>So the idea... well, let's not kid ourselves. It's a total ripoff, but y'know? I love the Don't Escape games, so I figured I'd try my hand at making one. It seemed like a fun idea, so I wanted to try it.</p>\n<p>Why wildebeasts you ask? ...I dunno, I think they're those things \u00a0from Lion King? (Wildebeests to be specific) but I mean, these clearly aren't the same... in the end, I don't have a good reason. I just picked it.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is VERY unpolished. I spent the last few days fixing bugs and even now, I bet it's still very unfinished. There are likely an excessive number of grammatical errors that I missed, and of course, the \"graphics\" were meant to be placeholder until I got around to making proper ones (but of course I fell extremely short of the deadline so I gave up on that) Maybe if I make a 2.0 for this, I'll add graphics with color.
