People raved about the atmosphere, the music, and the challenge. We even got emails from people who played through the game with their families over the holidays. One guy woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom only to find his father was up at 3am still playing through the game. Really incredible stuff.</p>\n<p>Not only a re-release, we decided to give the graphics of the first section of the game an overhaul and added an awesome stats screen to keep track of how many hours you've put into the game, how many moves you've made on each floor, and some other little tidbits.</p>\n<p>The same great levels. The same great music. The same great level editor. All here for you to enjoy for the first time if you missed out on the original release, or to enjoy once again if you have to collect every variant of every game. I won't judge!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Hopefully I didn't forget anything obvious. Thanks for your interest!</p>\n<p>Please note: this game is GTROM, so you must use an emulator that supports this mapper. Any recent version of FCEUX or Mesen will do. Can't be liable if you purchase this game and it doesn't work with the emulator you use.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T06:06:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8d/b8d5d33c3000c067a130311218f15621.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KHAN Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
