As a bone mason with ghosts for hands, use this opportunity to build the bone art of your dreams in this physics-based VR building game.</em></p>\n<p>Made for the\u00a0AR/VR Creators' Fall Challenge:\u00a0Halloween\u00a0jam in about 5 days.</p>\n<p><strong>VR Required</strong>! Available for Oculus Quest and desktop VR (SteamVR, Oculus desktop, and Windows Mixed Reality).</p>\n<p>Connect the bones to floating pentagrams to summon the living into the realm of the dead. Harvest their bones, and release their souls.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Control</strong>MoveHold the side grip and drag the worldGrabHover over a white bone and hold the front trigger. Release the trigger to drop it. If a joint of the white bone is close enough to an occupied joint of a red bone, then it will automatically attach.HarvestHover over one of the living and squeeze the trigger.\r\n<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>\n<ol><li>The joints are somewhat flexible, but if there is too much strain on the bones, they will collapse or even disintegrate.</li><li>You can connect a single bone to multiple joints at the same time by making sure its joints are close to multiple joints on your tower. A right triangle is very sturdy.</li><li>When trying to reach a pentagram, one quick way is\u00a0to start from right below it and build straight up. To connect the tower to the pentagram, you need to attach a new loose white bone that touches a joint on the tower AND a joint on the pentagram at the same time. See Youtube video, starting at 2:38.</li><li>You can grab a loose bone and use it as a tool to nudge things. You can also hit the living with it. Don't feel bad, the living are self-entitled flesh bags.</li><li>When you open up a pentagram portal, a new pentagram will appear above it.</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Third Party Music:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Mysterious Cinematic Foreboding Background by MusicLFiles<br/>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/7695-mysterious-cinematic-foreboding-background<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Unity, Blender, Substance Painter, Audacity<br/><strong>Libraries:</strong> Props Animations, Universal Sound FX pack, Soniss GDC Game Audio Bundle</p>\n<p>You might recognize the humans here\u00a0are recycled from one of my other games:\u00a0Concourse X-Ray</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T10:29:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b49/b49535906bfc225d14dfdce6543ec145.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["andyman404"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
