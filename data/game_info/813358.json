She is known for her interest in fairy tales since she was little. Even though some of her friends make fun of her, Emily never cares about it, and she would never mind people who doesn\u2019t like fairy tales. She believes in magic and sometimes talks to her toys. </em><br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Emily's most precious belonging is her pillow. Because her favorite time of the day is when she sleeps; dreams are the place that Emily can feel like she lives in fairy tales for real. So her pillow is with her every time, it is the closest to her in all her dreams, and Emily sees him as her best friend. Although her family worries about this situation, they think that such things might be normal since Emily is a little girl.</em><br/></p>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Join Emily and take a part in this\u00a0adventure!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Design<br/></strong>Eyl\u00fcl Civelek<br/>Derya Berge<br/>\u0130layda P\u0131narba\u015f\u0131<br/>Taha S\u00f6kmen<br/><br/><strong>Programmer<br/></strong>Taha S\u00f6kmen<br/><br/><strong>Concept Art<br/></strong>Eyl\u00fcl Civelek<br/>\u0130layda P\u0131narba\u015f\u0131<br/><br/><strong>3D Art</strong><br/>Eyl\u00fcl Civelek<br/><br/><strong>Environment Art</strong><br/>Eyl\u00fcl Civelek<br/><br/><strong>2D Art &amp; UI<br/></strong>\u0130layda P\u0131narba\u015f\u0131<br/><br/><strong>Level Design<br/></strong>Derya Berge<br/>Eyl\u00fcl Civelek<br/><br/><strong>Music/Sounds<br/></strong>\u0130layda P\u0131narba\u015f\u0131<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T16:51:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f19/f1947f562b4ffcfbb70d45658de1a7fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ruinera", "ilaylay", "JustRelaxable"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
