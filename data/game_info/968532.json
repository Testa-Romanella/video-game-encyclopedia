There's this girl...</strong><br/><br/>The other day, I decided to go to the store for some cigarettes, and I met this amazing girl, a solid 10/10. She's unlike anyone else... Beautiful, dresses in black, smokes... and her smile... I can't stop thinking about her.<br/><br/>As for me, I'm just a regular depressed guy, who spends most of his time watching anime and fapping. A guy like me doesn't stand a chance with her.<br/><br/>How do I approach her and make a move, anons? Share your advice and wisdom. You don't come across a girl like her every day, and something inside tells me she could change my gray life.<br/><br/>And what would you do if you meet your dream girl?<h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Captivating story<br/></li><li>Animated characters and backgrounds<br/></li><li>Animated sex scene<br/></li><li>Visual effects<br/></li><li>Comfy music<br/></li><li>Achievements</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-30T02:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cf/2cffaea5f7aadfcbce7fbd02ee8eeae9.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/BananaSlimeTeam", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Banana Slime"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Banana Slime"], "esrb_rating": null}
