In today's society people feel lonelier each day. This game is about playing together with a friend or family in the same computer, where you can share laughs and have a good time together. <br/><br/>The challenges may be a bit difficult in multiplayer, so you have to communicate and have a very good timing. We also made a singleplayer mode for those those who prefer to play alone, but remember that the focus of the game is co-op. <br/><br/>The game is still a work in progress, so this is just a trial version of the game for you guys to try the first level. In the future there may be many more features.\u00a0Try to play the downloadable version for better performance.<br/><br/>Any suggestions, bugs, or complains, please send an e-mail to\u00a0twogethere_demo@hotmail.com.</p><p>We hope you enjoy. :)<br/><br/>The team:</p><p>Diogo Magalh\u00e3es - Programming<br/>Lucas Cerqueira - Programming<br/>Guilherme Santos - Game Design / 3D modeling<br/>Hugo Gomes - Programming<br/>Matheus Ribeiro - Scripting / Translation<br/>Rafael Giordanno - Music / Sound Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76ddf75279bf6a032ce2716d36fafb3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["orc"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
