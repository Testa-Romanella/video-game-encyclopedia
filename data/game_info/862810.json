We learned a lot, for example: mixing\u00a0our various skills together to make a unique game style - 2d art with 3d programming - and we think it turned out great!</p>\n<p>If we had more time, we would change the following...</p>\n<ul><li>Give better indications of where you need to go for certain items\r\n</li><li>Include a currency system so that customers pay the shopkeeper\r\n</li><li>Add in the watering cannister that the shopkeeper carries around</li><li>Finish adding UI elements for the timer and event counter\r\n</li><li>Polishing! More sound balancing, more knickknacks, etc.</li></ul>\n<p>All in all, our band of friends had a wonderful 72 hours of creating, designing, and building.
