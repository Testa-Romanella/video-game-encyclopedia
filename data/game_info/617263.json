The music is kinda decent i guess. But still if its\u00a0 anoying you could mute it. I'll add a settings tab and more levels after the voting time is done.</p>\n\n<p>I foun out that there was a bug when you use URP and WebGL in unity. So i decided to find out more but i did not have time so i hope i submit my game in time right now I am building the game without URP so it may look odd. I had lights to help the level design and make everything look good but I need to settle with UNITY'S PARTICLE SYSTEM.</p>\n<p>I can't figure out how to fix this proplem because I cant run a WebGL thingy on itch. so there is a downloadable so i could submit something to the game jam right before the deadline. I did not have time to build and submit the game with the URP. (Honestly I did not want to sit and do the setup thing for URP\u00a0 agan but now for more scenes I normally dont use prefabs so it woud take som time).</p>\n<p>I really hope that this atleast works for now I'll fix it to work in the web.</p>\n<p>The controls are:</p>\n<p>Moving with A and D\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump with Space</p>\n<p>Alternatively use arow keys and space</p>\n<p>Left click to swich Character</p>\n\n<p>To download:</p>\n<p>1.
