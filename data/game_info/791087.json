Your goal is to escape and wander through the unexplored terror that is the Backrooms. Your journey is being recorded with a VHS Camcorder which then observed for research purposes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A-sync later manages to find a direct link between realities and review your found footage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note several tips: <br/>1) In level 0 you're searching for a corrupt/flashing texture to go through in order to progress<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>2) When your game closes itself, you died and have to restart. This is a placeholder for the death animation which is coming very soon!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This is one of my first ever projects when it comes to game creation, all animations and coding was done by me alone through the use of tutorials, stack overflow, unity help forums, etc. Therefore the game might lack several qualities especially in the cutscenes which I am aware of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project initially started as a joke for a relative of mine who really enjoyed the backrooms and I wanted to give them an experience they would apprecitate. As I developed the game more and more, I ended up not only finding passion for game creation but also found this project too developed to be a joke, so I decided to take it upon myself to give it some life. Hence why I uploaded it here.\u00a0There are further updates planned.</p>\n<p><strong>Report found bugs in the comments!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T14:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cc/3cc31150f99c936d9b20f56c6b5f2dbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheRealAhri"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
