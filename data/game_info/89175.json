Toddlers can use the paint bucket to tap and fill-in different colors, while older kids can choose from 3 different brush sizes. <br/>\u2022 ERASE - 12 fun scratch cards: Little ones who may not yet have the fine motor skills to draw or color can rub away the silver surface of each picture to discover what\u2019s underneath! <br/><br/>\u2022 PIANO: Fancy some music? Free play on a keyboard with the notes supplied by cats, frogs, cows or fish! <br/>\u2022 REMEMBER: Just like the classic \u2018Simon Says\u2019 game, animals sing notes and your child has to repeat them in the same order. <br/><br/>\u2022 FIND IT: See if you can spot all the differences in each of the 30 animal scenes. <br/>\u2022 PAIRS: This version of the classic matching game starts easy but includes 110 cards! <br/><br/>\u2022 PUZZLE: 60 additional puzzles with 8 pieces each for older kids and 15 puzzles with 4 pieces each for the littlest ones. <br/>\u2022 ROLL: A \u2018tap and turn\u2019 game for children who would find the slider puzzles too much of a challenge. <br/>\u2022 SLIDER PUZZLE: With patience and persistence you CAN get the pieces in the right spot of 11 beautiful sliding puzzles! <br/><br/>\u2022 COLLECT: Help Mama fish through the 25 mazes to collect stars for her 5 little babies. <br/>\u2022 CATCH: Like \u2018whack-a-mole\u2019 you have to tap the animals as they pop up - but make sure you get the right ones! <br/>\u2022 COLORS: A fun, fishy, bubble flinging game. <br/><br/>The games in the fabulous Animal Playground are designed to engage children as young as two years old but increase in complexity and difficulty so that children up to the age of six will still find them a challenge. Perfect for siblings to play together or for kids to enjoy with their parents. <br/><br/>While playing all these games in addition to having fun your children are developing and reinforcing all kinds of skills, including: <br/><br/>\u2022 An understanding of object permanence <br/>\u2022 Matching and discriminating <br/>\u2022 Fine and visual motor <br/>\u2022 Spatial and bilateral awareness <br/>\u2022 Logic and problem solving <br/>\u2022 Persistence <br/>\u2022 Independent play <br/><br/>This app was developed by me together with my children, incorporating feedback from parents and educators.
