The challenge was to make a game played with a single button and with\u00a0the theme Audio. It is recommended to play with sound (use headphones for the best experience). If you are hard of hearing, there are visual cues so you can still complete the game.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Controls</strong>: Spacebar to jump, You may need to click the game window if the keyboard is not working at the start, or in rare cases reload the page.</li><li><strong>Sound Effects:</strong>\u00a0All the sound effects are royalty-free from Pixabay or mixkit.co. I edited the sounds with Audacity to create the final versions for each scene.
