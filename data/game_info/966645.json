Shortly after, the game starts, and the player controls a small cannon positioned at the top of the castle using the keyboard arrows. This cannon continuously fires spheres that fall due to gravity. These spheres collide with various balloons rising on the screen. Each balloon has a number indicating how many hits it needs to burst. When a balloon reaches a certain height on the screen, the value marked on it is subtracted from the player's cannon life. There is a bar at the bottom of the screen that fills over time. <br/>\r\n Every time the bar is fully charged, the player can choose another upgrade. The game ends when the cannon's life count reaches zero, or when the player survives against waves of enemies for 15 minutes. Additionally, there's an upgrade system where the more points the player accumulates during matches, the more upgrades they can choose at the beginning of the game, starting with 1 and going up to a maximum of 10.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T03:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1df/1df1a4948ac5de3e6ce56f1d86022c81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artur Rezende"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PROATIV GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
