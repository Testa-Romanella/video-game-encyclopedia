The goal of the game is to park your car in the target area. Simple right? Unfortunately, you are not in direct control of the car and must pre-record your driving input; gas, brakes, steering and guide the car to the goal.\u00a0 Your input will be replayed to the car as it drives out of control.</p>\n<p>Can be played with mouse/keyboard or gamepad.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>W/S | Top/Bottom Gamepad Face Button:\u00a0Throttle/Brakes/Reverse</p>\n<p>A/D | Left\u00a0Gamepad Joystick:\u00a0Steering</p>\n<p>Spacebar | Gamepad Left Shoulder Button:\u00a0Handbrake</p>\n<p>Tab:\u00a0Switch Camera Views</p>\n\n<p>Made in 48hrs as an entry for the GMTK Game Jam 2020</p>\n\n<p>Mesh assets from Synty Studios, Epic Games<br/></p>\n<p>Music from filmmusic.io:<br/> Slow Ska Game Loop by Kevin MacLeod<br/> Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/4375-slow-ska-game-loop<br/> License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Special thanks to @ingmarmatthis for recording video footage.</p>\n<p>Made with Unreal Engine 4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:18:40", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["urist999"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
