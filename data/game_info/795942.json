You have until the time runs out before the button has to recharge. If you click the button while it's recharging, you lose a word, and for every second after it's done recharging and before you start clicking the button again, you also lose a word.</p>\n<p>Most games I make are a love letter to the things I appreciate. This is not. I like clicker games. Too much. They have drained days and even weeks of my life. They are traps for people like me. So,\u00a0I decided to make a game that would be the perfect trap for my personality.</p>\n<p>Clicker games are a vague genre, and I'm unsure if mine counts. However, it does aim to\u00a0bring about the same feelings I have while playing a clicker game: love and hatred that both result in\u00a0despair, pain in my wrist, fear of breaking my mouse, and--for some reason--the need to keep playing to find out how it ends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And let me tell you, the ending of this game\u00a0isn't worth it. As with many things, it is best to quit while you are still having fun. You've been warned.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Story inspired by Three Days of Happiness by\u00a0Sugaru Miaki</p>\n<p>Font: Urbanist by Corey Hu (github.com/coreyhu/Urbanist)</p>\n<p>Music SFX: Anthousai\u00a0(https://freesound.org/people/Anthousai/sounds/398814/)</p>\n<p>Game Dev/Writer/Composer:\u00a0Fallenspring Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T09:13:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fa21899cb26a2ed01b38bd36cbf89b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fallenspring Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
