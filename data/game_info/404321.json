Turns out, the artifact can be used to access memory from objects in the world. There you found faint images of a girl that you used to be close with. It's like she is giving you clues to find her. Who is she? And what is her relation to you? Furthermore, how does it connect with the world?</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The game is still arguably <strong>Under Development</strong>. It was planned to develop the game in Unity, but as time came we decided to make this prototype with RPG Maker VX Ace, while progressing the essential features in Unity. We realized that the game still has so little content, that's why we put lores and demonstrations here and there.
