From time to time zombies will spawn on the map (red circles will tell you where they spawn next). They will directly chase you! You can feed the zombie by making him move into the blood-collectibles (green circles will tell you where they spawn next).\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you feed a zombie then he will disappear and another zombie will spawn immediately. You may wonder why you should feed them, right? For two reasons:</p>\n<ul><li>Feeding a zombie will give you points</li><li>Feeding a zombie resets the current timer for spawning a new zombie</li></ul>\n<p>So while you can't reduce the amount of zombies on the map - you can try to slow down how fast they will grow.</p>\n<p>More zombies = more danger!\u00a0</p>\n<p>It can happen that you start a chain reaction by feeding multiple zombies in a row. Be aware that this will be really dangerous situation. Because you won't be able to predict where the next zombie will spawn.\u00a0</p>\n<br/><br/>\r\nGame-Jam-Game?\r\n<p>Yes, Game-Jam-Game! And actually I'm in two game jams at the same time. So I only spend two days on this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The related jam is the\u00a0Bolt Jam 9.</p>\n<p>Art and Music</p>\n<p>Art and music are from those bundles:</p>\n<p>https://malibudarby.itch.io/horror-city-sprite-pack-1</p>\n<p>https://joelsteudler.itch.io/survival-horror-music-mega-pack-vol-2</p>\n<p>(at the moment they're also part of this humble-bundle:\u00a0Game Creator (Humble Bundle))</p>\n<br/><br/>\r\nSources\r\n<p>Because the jam wants to have a proof that bolt was used I will attach my sources here. But those of course\u00a0won't contain the paid assets!\u00a0</p>\n<p>That project makes use of the following packages:</p>\n<ul><li>Cinemachine</li><li>TextMesh Pro</li></ul>\n<p>You can download both for free from the Unity-Package-Manager. In the end this is what you'll get:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T03:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85eb7746269a21e13b3dd1360cf1e299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
