Storm pushed Earth's magnetic field beyond planet circumference, allowing huge amounts of solar radiation to penetrate to the ground level. The temperature and radiation spike killed much of life on the surface and resulted in DNA mutations of life forms as small as viruses.<br/><br/>When CME ended, the earth's magnetic field had reshaped into its protective function, but by then all life on earth was barely clinging to survival. Years passed and the surface is still a very dangerous place to live. Humans established settlements either deep underground or high above it. Mutants and gangs roam the wasteland in search of food, drink, and loot.<br/><br/>As a commander of the Union, a semi state organization with military and research potential, your goal is to help humanity rebuild. Modern military technology will give you an edge over the bandits, but the task will be far from an easy one.<h3>Make scientific direction choices that will help the civilian population and your troops survive in the hostile world.\u00a0</h3><br/><h3>Expand your bases, deliver aid to settlements, rescue survivors, fight for food, water and medical supplies.\u00a0</h3><br/><h3>On missions, you will come face to face with gangs of cyborgs, bandits, and mutants. Modern military technology may not be enough against their superior numbers.\u00a0</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>ADULT CONTENT DESCRIPTION</strong><br/><br/>This Game contains visual content not appropriate for all ages.<br/>Frequent depictions of violence and gore.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T13:00:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/590/590e9a44ba9b107d63b24437258a76fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Binge Gaming OU"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Binge Gaming OU"], "esrb_rating": null}
