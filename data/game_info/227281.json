From the creators of the popular Weaphones series comes a new experience set in the time of black powder guns, outlaws and revolutionaries. <br/><br/>Imagine yourself in the Old West as you load the classic Colt Single Action Revolver or as you crank the lever on the legendary 1873 Winchester Lever Rifle. Perhaps you fancy yourself a Civil War soldier hurrying to prime the pan and give fire on the unyielding Flintlock Rifle or maybe you just want to send a wall of lead out of the Pirate's favorite weapon the Blunderbuss. All of this is just a download away. Stay safe and have fun as you learn about the weapons you have only seen in movies and museums.  <br/><br/>Weaphones Antiques is not another run-of-the-mill gun app. We have toiled over the details to make it the most authentic firearms simulator. Each weapon operates identical to its real life counterpart when loading, priming, cocking, cycling and firing. To enhance the simulation enable the flash feature which will set off your device's flash with each shot. Grab a hold of your device and fine tune the layout of the weapon to truly immerse yourself in the experience of being a gunslinger. Check out the step-by-step animated tutorials to quickly help you get familiar with each weapon. There is no in-app-purchases or up-sells, just  a one of a kind journey into the history of firearms.<br/>_______________________________<br/><br/>\u00bb Realistic Fire, Sound, Smoke, Flash &amp; Recoil Effects<br/>\u00bb Full Interaction and Control<br/>\u00bb Authentic Weapon Mechanics<br/>\u00bb No Up-Sells or In-App-Purchases, You Get Everything Plus Free Updates<br/>\u00bb Detailed Full HD Graphics<br/>\u00bb Customizable to Fit User\u2019s Hand Size and Preference<br/>    \u2192 Lefty Flip<br/>    \u2192 Rotate 180\u00b0<br/>    \u2192 Scale<br/>    \u2192 Move<br/>\u00bb User Adjustable Variables<br/>    \u2192 Unlimited Ammo<br/>    \u2192 Auto-Reload <br/>    \u2192 Accelerometer Reloading<br/>    \u2192 Camera Flash Shooting<br/>\u00bb Weapon State Indicator (\u201cWhy Am I Not Shooting?\u201d)<br/>\u00bb Ultra Detailed Step-By-Step Animated Tutorial for Each Weaphone<br/>\u00bb Multi-Touch, Accelerometer &amp; Camera Flash Support<br/>\u00bb Social Media Driven Future Content<br/>_______________________________<br/><br/>Interactive Features:<br/><br/>CAPLOCK BLUNDERBUSS: \u00bb Hammer \u00bb Percussion Cap \u00bb Ramrod \u00bb Powder Horn \u00bb Wad and Lead Balls \u00bb Trigger <br/><br/>COLT 1851 NAVY: \u00bb Hammer \u00bb Cylinder \u00bb Round \u00bb Percussion Cap \u00bb Pan Charger \u00bb Loading Lever \u00bb Trigger <br/><br/>COLT SINGLE ACTION: \u00bb Loading Gate \u00bb Hammer \u00bb Cartridge \u00bb Cylinder \u00bb Ejector Rod \u00bb Trigger <br/><br/>WINCHESTER MODEL 1873: \u00bb Lever Safety \u00bb Dust Cover \u00bb Lever \u00bb Hammer \u00bb Trigger <br/><br/>FLINTLOCK RIFLE: \u00bb Hammer \u00bb Frizzen \u00bb Pan Primer \u00bb Ramrod \u00bb Powder Horn \u00bb Wad and Lead Ball \u00bb Trigger <br/><br/>COACH GUN: \u00bb Barrel Latch \u00bb Barrels \u00bb Shotgun Rounds \u00bb Hammers \u00bb Triggers", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T05:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b65/b6576076322f03730857d7b70d8a4bcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["OranginalPlan"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
