Due to a power distribution fault on your ship, you are only able to shoot or activate auxiliary thrusters separately from each other. \u00a0This means you can either move or shoot, but not both at once. <br/></p>\n<p>Along your journey you'll be greeted by virtual traders that can offer you software upgrades for your ship, improving hardware efficiency and even adding new features. You may only select one item from each trader, each upgrade has 5 levels of improvement. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Upgrade Item List</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 <strong>Full Heal<br/></strong></p>\n<p>When selected in the upgrade shop, this item will immediately refill all lost lives.</p>\n<p> \u00a0 <strong>Rapid Fire<br/></strong></p>\n<p>When selected in the upgrade shop, this upgrade will increase your main gun's rate of fire.\u00a0 This upgrade is maxed at level 5.</p>\n<p> \u00a0 <strong>Angle Fire<br/></strong></p>\n<p>When selected in the upgrade shop, this upgrade will activate your secondary angled guns on level 1 and increase their rate of fire for each additional level.\u00a0 This upgrade is maxed at level 5.</p>\n<p> \u00a0<strong> Intermittent Shield</strong></p>\n<p>When selected in the upgrade shop, this upgrade will activate your intermittent shield drive on level 1 and increase the length of time it can be maintained  for \r\neach additional level.\u00a0 This upgrade is maxed at level 5.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>Speed Up</strong></p>\n<p>When selected in the upgrade shop, this upgrade will increase the power of your auxiliary thrusters.
