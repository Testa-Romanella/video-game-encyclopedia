{"id": 99160, "slug": "glade", "name": "Glade", "name_original": "Glade", "description": "<p>\r\n\tGlade is an exploration game in which you pilot a small aircraft around a surreal, alien landscape. Thriving trees are evidence of environmental conditions favorable to life, and strange, clearly artificial structures point to the presence of sentient beings - but where is everyone? Uncover the mysteries of a ruined civilisation as you collect alien artefacts and reveal more of the planet's past.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>This game is the result of me learning Unity from scratch in a week, beginning with experiments in using materials and textures on the \"wrong\" models just for fun, and culminating in a complete narrative arc which had begun to take shape on hearing about the Fermi Paradox jam. It is partly an exercise in working within constraints, as I almost exclusively used only the standard assets.<br/>\n</em>\n</p><p>\n<em>The tight deadline forced me to make compromises I would never normally have accepted, so I consider the result more of a prototype which, if I ever have the time and inspiration, I may build on.</em>\n</p>\r\nCredits<p>\r\n\tMusic: Liam Cooke, excerpts from Moonglade (\r\n\thttp://novasolus.bandcamp.com/album/moonglade), Stranded (http://novasolus.bandcamp.com/track/stranded), Enceladus (https://soundcloud.com/novasolus/enceladus)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlien: free model from the Asset Store (\r\n\thttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/16469)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSkybox: composite of these 3 images -\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>\r\n\thttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Orion_-_Clear_night_sky.jpg</li>\n<li> https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jalama,_Night_Sky_(8359077006)_(2).jpg</li>\n<li>\r\n\thttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spruce-knob-night-sky-7_ForestWander.jpg\r\n\t</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e12efacf67f14216e9916bae03e91f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["memoriata"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
