The three concepts that defined a tower defence game. Endless Defence 2 is a completely new simplified take on the genre, with most aspects of tower defence reviewed, polished and improved.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA tower defence game without in app purachases, annoying dlcs, and overcomplicated concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGo out and survive as long as possible against ever increasing enemies, with only 5 towers. A machine gun, a laser, a missile launcher, a money-making tower,  and a super tower. That might not seem like much, but it's all you need in your small arsenal. Play against difficult challenges, each offering their own unique styles of gameplay, either by surviving a set amount of waves, or by completing the construction of a fort. Or pit it out against endless waves of enemies that increase in time, and try to beat your high score! If that's not challenging, try our hard mode, with buffed enemies, new waves, and completely redesigned gameplay! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCheck out our official youtube channel: https://youtu.be/m2rDMjgXT7A<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCheck out our discord: https://discord.gg/Kn4YXEs", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ff/6fff558b6640b08f60d618558b6a74dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Wu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["SOUP STUDIOS"], "esrb_rating": null}
