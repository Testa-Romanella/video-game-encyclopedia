The procedure is illegal in most countries, however, in the U.S -- it it still legal (in some states). The purpose of this project was to try and inform and change minds. A lot of people do not know what an actual 'de-claw' is. In short, it is an amputation. It is nothing like trimming your cat's claws.<br/>Article: [<em>SOURCE</em>]</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Project Goals:<br/></strong>The goal of this project was to further help change how people feel about the de-clawing process. I also do hope this will help player's who have played this game spread the word and stop the de-clawing process from happening to more feline friends in the U.S.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Created using the Bitsy tool<br/>- Nicole Finegan</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T17:52:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fc/6fc9afadf7046d767c7ba3ac75c8ccd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["seacomet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
