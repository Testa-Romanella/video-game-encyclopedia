It is in a sense a mixture of match3 games and autobattlers. Try it and you will understand everything</p>\n<p>How to play:<br/>In the game there are 2 game modes - This is a \"Campaign\" and \"Challenge\"<br/>For the campaign, you should collect at least one star to achieve the goal and pass the level. Try to get 3 stars!</p>\n<p>For the \"Challenge\" you should already think through your actions, because every step is worth its weight in gold</p>\n<p>Now more about the points system:<br/>The game has 3 levels of blocks</p>\n<p>1. Normal block. He gives few points for the destruction, but he is able to destroy the neighboring blocks that are on the diagonal with respect to him. If you do not have good moves, then it is worth breaking the most massive cluster<br/>2. Block of the second level. Such blocks are already more powerful. If you burst one of them, then you will be able to destroy several lines at once.<br/>3. Block of the third level. These are the coolest blocks. Often they can destroy half, and sometimes the whole playing field.<br/>4. Bonus block. It does not belong to the first three blocks. When you click on it, you get a random effect of a random block. Risky but justified</p>\n<p>Also! You have to connect similar blocks and then you will get an enhanced version. Blocks can be connected regardless of the distance!</p>\n<p>Features:<br/>\u2665 Combine blocks to get stronger elements.<br/>\u2665 Each block is special<br/>\u2665 No distance restrictions when connecting blocks<br/>\u2665 Try yourself in the \"Challenge\", how long can you stand?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T07:34:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bd/5bd0415c276875e9e75faab8ba3b600c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Flikes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
