I had plans to expand it further, add more classes, item pickups, maybe skills to use. Sadly, lack of experience was what killed the beast - the further I went, the harder it was to maintain the original codebase. On top of that - since I've picked up quite a niche library with almost no community around it, each problem required me to twist my head around. Eventually, I simply got burnt out and moved to other projects, with other tools. But I still consider this demo quite a fun little thing to kill some time on coffee breaks. So... yeah, thats why I brought it there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to move.</p>\n<p><strong>LMB</strong> to attac.<br/></p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong>:</p><p>- <strong>pkulev</strong> and <strong>weird-ego</strong> for teaching me how to python and contributing some code.</p><p>- <strong>panda3d discord community</strong> for existing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T11:27:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21a/21aff3b988b9a7b27cdf0c59292d1a73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["moonburnt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
