You can pause the game and access menus with the Escape key or the start/menu button on a controller. Controller support should work fine for Xbox and \r\nXbox-compatible controllers, but non-xinput controllers are \r\nnot supported currently. Stairs are designed to be able to be walked through. Press the up or down arrow keys (or whatever you've mapped up and down to) to get on stairs when at the bottom or top of a staircase.</p>\n<p>Please report any bugs you find.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in helping this game have better art, please contact me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6c42439a0daaf8f7764426168373fdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["General Vagueness"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
