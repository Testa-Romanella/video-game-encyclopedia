You play as Saoirse who is trying to find her parents after they didn't return home from their night shift. You will have to avoid demons,\u00a0battle satanic cultists and challenge the devil himself to a game of cards.</p>\n<p><strong>The Inspiration</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In the original tale of the hellfire club, it is said that a stranger came to club one night to play a game of cards. After winning hand after hand, the patrons grew suspicious. The stranger dropped one of his cards and before he could pick it up one of the players at the table bent down to get it. When he looked at the strangers feet he noticed they were cloven hoofs. The player shot up and screamed in terror. The stranger then shifted into his true form and dispersed in a ball of flames setting the club alight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We've taken a lot of liberties with the original story and used elements to create the experience\u00a0we are presenting to you.
