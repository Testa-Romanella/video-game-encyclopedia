Game is easy to learn, but hard to master. In single player mode you fight one or more tanks driven by artificial intelligence of different abilities. All tanks have equal abilities and can endure equal damage regardless of the type of the tank. AI is very slow at the beginning allowing you enough time and space to get experienced. Controls are very simple and anyone can do it with a little practice. Game can also be played with the standard joypad/gamepad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b304f58a83b0e625d25fb8d6b5baa6b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoderGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
