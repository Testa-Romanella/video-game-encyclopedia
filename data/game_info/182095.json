{"id": 182095, "slug": "roundspace", "name": "Roundspace", "name_original": "Roundspace", "description": "<p>Roundspace is a small game I made as a prototype a couple of years ago, and recently rediscovered. It turns out that it is still a kind of cool concept, and (I think) worth a brief exploration.<br/></p><p>It's a one button game. Push space to make the mass bigger, and try hard to keep the bigger mass in the circle. That's it. And survive. As a warning - the source code is currently lost to my hard drives - but I may make an expedition to some old ones to try to find it. Unfortunately, XNA + old version of C# means that this will likely be the only version of this specific game - meaning that it's unlikely I'll be able to fix any bugs or even open source it. If I find the code, that'll change. I may make another new game based around the concept soon.</p><p>I'd still like any feedback.
