Can you fly through the 12 levels to recover the Time Crystal?</p>\n<p>This is my first game, and my fist submission to a Game Jam (thanks to GameDev.tv!). I'm a beginner developer, this has been a challenging month, but a very exciting one! I've learnt heaps, had a lot of fun, obsessed a fair bit, and succeeded at completing and submitting the game. I hope you like it! If you try it out and feel like giving me some feedback:</p>\n<ul><li>What was hard?</li><li>What was the most fun?</li><li>What would you change?</li><li>Did you make it to the last part of\u00a0level 12? Totally worth it! :)</li><li>...</li></ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n<ul><li><strong>Left/right arrow keys:</strong> rotate the fairy</li><li><strong>Space:</strong> fly</li><li><strong>Escape:</strong>\u00a0pause game</li></ul>\n<p>Some of my testers complain that it's a bit hard to play. While this is a skill-based game and its supposed to be a bit challenging,\u00a0I've chosen to publish with two cheat codes, for those who find it too difficult:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>G:</strong> toggles <strong>G</strong>od mode onf/off\u00a0(invincible), but brings bad karma. ;)</li><li><strong>L:</strong> skip to next <strong>L</strong>evel</li></ul>\r\nSource code\r\n<p>This project is released under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

It runs very smoothly on my 8-year old Mac. My suspicion is that it doesn't work so well without a dedicated graphics card (mine is a NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1GB, so nothing fancy is required).</p>\n<p>Being a beginner, I didn't know how to optimize performance very well. I tried a bit with lightmap baking, but I ran into multiple problems that I didn't have the knowledge nor the time to work out. So I've published it as is, but with the Unity launcher included, so you can at least adjust the resolution/quality, should you have performance issues. Btw, any tips on how to go about optimization will be most than welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:41:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/ddd503844fa378b1e9203a4923dc49e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["dense13"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
