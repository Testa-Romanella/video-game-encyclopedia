The reason is that humans have discovered a mineral called blue carbon underground. This mineral contains extremely high energy. A high-purity blue ore can provide 200 days of lighting. At the same time, FSS, an energy company using blue ore, became the government, allowing poor people to live in underground blue ore mining plants with strict regulations.</p>\n<p>The player will play as an ordinary worker, Gray. In the next few days, he will lead the residents of Gray Town to face the increasingly strict FSS tyranny, or succumb to power, let himself go to the surface and leave Gray Town.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to let players realize how terrifying the power of reporting in their hands, and hope that everyone can use the power of reporting.</p>\n<p>The game is mainly for players who can read and have the ability to think independently.
