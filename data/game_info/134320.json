Cryptocurrencies hit a new record and nobody wanted to deal with gaming hardware whatsoever. Nodiva and CPtel stoped GPU and CPU manufacturing and totally switched to crypto-mining hardware. Other players left the market as well.</p>\n<p>Many years after the crash, when all gamers were back to boardgames, only one company risked to enter the market again with the series of 8-bit consoles. When nobody believed... Becoming a greedy monopolist, controlling 98% of the market.</p>\n<p>Now all developers must release on their hardware, use their dev kit and obey their rules and regulations. Even landing a contract with them is a big deal!</p>\n<p>You just joined the ranks of licensed Sonado Inc. developers and got the privilege to release games.</p>\n<p>On Sonado Inc. platform...</p>\n<p>With Sonado Inc. programming language...</p>\n<p>With Sonado.Inc DevKit...</p>\n<p>With Sonado Inc. rules and limitations...</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Develop and Publish Games</strong></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>You development desk consists of the following items:</p>\n<p>* SonaVision game console (development version)</p>\n<p>* Sonado Inc. BBS terminal</p>\n<p>* DevKit Editor</p>\n<p>Use editor to modify the rom image.</p>\n<p>On any stage you can publish the game by flushing existing ROM chips.
