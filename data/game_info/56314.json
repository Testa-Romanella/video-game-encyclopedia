The game represents all of its characters as cards, but plays like a dungeon-crawling RPG, rather than a card-based game. In keeping with this metaphor, the death of a character results in a 'torn' card, and the magical properties of some cards are used to explain abilities of the game's characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-15T12:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a4/3a444261fdb41b05c4a3dc4e59ce4b50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "SNES"], "developers": ["HAL Laboratory"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["HAL Laboratory"], "esrb_rating": null}
