I also tried messing around with the damage script to make a certain area more dangerous but should be easy to complete. If you get knocked out by the moving platforms of the building there is a giant block that should one hit kill you by landing on it so you can restart the level in game instead of manually with the menu,\u00a0cause you'll keep falling cause nothing will make you die.</p><p>If you're making it this far, I kinda already guessed that this game would feel a bit different on the Web so It wouldn't feel as smooth. I didn't want that to distract from the game play, so to work a round this a little, my level 3 my most clunkiest level. If you want to get through the first part, there is a corner with the keycard you can easily get instead of trying to get it from the moving platforms. There is also a \"chariot\" ride if you wait for it to come on the third part to carry you to the end of the level and its meant to be like that but you can walk through the doors if you wanted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T09:15:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27a/27a128bd94b2fd1ce9ff472c16ec1484.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Simachio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
