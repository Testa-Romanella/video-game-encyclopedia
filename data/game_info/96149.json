Players are encouraged to play the game alone at night with earphones to live a horrific adventure.<br />\nAn experience with powerful new gameplay mechanicsAura<br />\nThe player character (Demilux) has a blue aura underneath him. This aura represents the amount of light essence your character has and his life total. As your character\u2019s light essence diminishes over time, the aura under him will get smaller and his light will begin to dim. Once your light is completely faded, it\u2019s game over and you will have to restart the stage from the beginning. In order to keep your light from going out, Demilux can pick up light prisms that will replenish his light essence.<br />\nMovements<br />\nPlayers control Demilux exclusively using the mouse; To move your character, move your mouse cursor in the direction you want Demilux to move; The further away from Demilux your cursor is, the faster he moves in that direction.<br />\nLight Surge<br />\nBy holding the left mouse button Demilux\u2019s movement speed is increased. This ability, known as the light surge not only serves to move faster but also allows your character to break through certain obstacles and avoid certain traps. Watch out though, using this ability comes at the cost of your character\u2019s light essence (life) and should be used conservatively.<br />\nDiminishing Light<br />\nBy holding the right mouse button, Demilux\u2019s movement speed is slowed down. Slowing down your character\u2019s movement makes it possible to sneak past certain obstacles that would otherwise harm Demilux. As an added effect, diminishing light reduces the light essence used up over time while the ability is active. When your character nears death, this ability can give you the extra inch needed to get to the next light prism in time and replenish your health.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30f737000238977658ecb382f9152431.jpg", "website": "http://leylinegames.com/project/the-last-aura/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Leyline Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Leyline Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
