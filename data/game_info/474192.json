Your goal is to do a variety of jobs, but these jobs have a particularity : they are probably dangerous to do, not by their nature, but by what is surrounding them. That's why JAR exists, we do jobs nobody wants to do, because of unknown strange reason no one wants to speak about, even the customers.</p>\n<p>What's the downloadable content ?<br/>A little demo, to try out the concept.</p>\n<p>What is (being) implemented ?<br/>The first job (fully implemented) is to be a cook in a restaurant, located in a small town. Make burgers, serve customers, take care of the restaurant, explore, speak, and try to discover why the restaurant's boss has called JAR.<br/>The second job (wip) is to work in a shop.<br/>French &amp; English languages are supported.</p>\n<p>What's next ?<br/>I hope to release it on steam by the end of 2020.<br/>I'd like to add multiplayer, it would add a lot of fun, but Unity currently is not as its best about multiplayer.<br/>I'd like to add more jobs. With that kind of gameplay, I can add as many jobs as I want, even if they are completely different.</p>\n<p>How can I support you ?<br/>The best way to support me is on Kickstarter, here : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/...<br/>or/and by following me on YouTube or here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoGg3yj-MD68AK1B0er2zQghttps://gamejolt.com/games/employeesi...</p><p>and spread the word !</p>Thanks\n<p>Job at Risk*</p>\n<p>*dare to join us</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T05:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/867/867bda0d9e9f1f83cd80c1b51a6dc883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Job at Risk"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
