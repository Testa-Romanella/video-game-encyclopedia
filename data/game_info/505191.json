I went slightly over time because I paused my timer and forget to restart it when I came back to the computer. Probally about 3 hours + 10-15 minutes not including exporting and submission. All assets made during the 3 hours\u00a0apart from some camera and physics code snippets that came from a GODOT demo in the asset library. Sound was done with BXFR and music with Wolfram Alpha tones.
