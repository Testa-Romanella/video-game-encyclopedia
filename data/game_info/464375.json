All assets, including art, sound, coding, were created within that time frame by me all by my lonesome lol. The one sort-of exception is the font, which <em>is </em>custom but I made it like a month ago. <br/></p>\n<p>The theme was \"out of control,\" and being from California, my mind quickly went towards the topic of out-of-control wildfires. So, here's a tiny management sim about that!<br/></p>\n<p>There's a lot I would have liked to do with this game if I had more time / knowledge, so who knows! Maybe it'll get a sequel someday lol.</p><p>CONTROLS:</p><p>When in a scenario: USE THE ARROW KEYS TO CONTROL THE CURSOR. If the cursor is over a creature, HIT SPACE TO ACTIVATE IT. <br/></p><p>If activating a FIREFIGHTER, there's a list of commands that put the firefighter into a different state.</p><p>STATE 1: GET WATER: the firefighter will have empty buckets. Maneuver them (with arrow keys) to a puddle to GATHER THE WATER UP. Afterwords, the firefighter will start wandering again but with a FLAG in the code turned on that they have water.</p><p>STATE 2: BREAK BLOCK: the firefighter will DESTROY ANY ROCKS they come into contact with. Animals sometimes hide under rocks, though!\u00a0</p><p>STATE 3: EMPTY BUCKETS: if the WATER FLAG from state 1 is turned ON, this state will allow the firefighter to dump the water out. If you hit SPACE, they'll dump the water out one space to the firefighter's right. Maneuver them next to a fire to put it out.\u00a0<br/><br/></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:01:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33c/33caaa40a6e757eda31200d6699f17ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wulfbuoy garwalfey"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
