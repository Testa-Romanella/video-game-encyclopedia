{"id": 285645, "slug": "liquisity", "name": "Liquisity", "name_original": "Liquisity", "description": "<p>Liquisity is a problem-solving action game where the player must get a ball past obstacles into a goal. Each level is set underwater. The player is given a cannon which can be used to fire a ball, with varying force. Once a ball is launched, the player can control it to a limited degree, with the left and right arrow keys. If a ball is destroyed or goes offscreen, the player can launch another. </p>\n<p>The levels contain obstacles and elements such as fans which block the way, sharp fans which destroy the ball, bubble jets which propel the ball in a specific direction, and others. Solving the level often involves carefully hitting switches to deactivate inconvenient obstacles. There are several different types of balls, in addition to the basic one: the metal ball is heavy and hard to control, but it can shatter glass barriers; the seltzer ball slowly dissolves in water and thus has a limited lifetime, but it can fit in tight spaces and avoid obstacles when shrunk, and it can be made to float upwards at any time. There is also a helicopter ball, which can move freely in any direction, but cannot exit the level. </p>\n<p>The game includes a built-in level editor, as well as some unlockable bonus content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-19T13:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed5/ed580e592200ac08edd41e13ddd84c0d.jpg", "website": "http://www.vertigogaming.net/main/freeware/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vertigo Gaming"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Vertigo Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
