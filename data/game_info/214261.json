I\u00a0am still working on fixing all the kinks and bugs within the game; however, I hope you enjoy and are able to complete the game without too much trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to escape the labyrinth in the sky that you have found yourself in. Using the 'WASD' keys to move, you must navigate through the labyrinth fighting enemies using your mouse buttons and 'E'.<br/></p>\n<p>Eventually, an enemy will drop the portal key. Pick up the portal key using the 'k' key to unlock one portal on the map. Your job is to then navigate through the maze looking for the unlocked portal.</p>\n<p>Upon finding it, you will be transported out of the labyrinth thus ending the game. If you are to die after finding the key, then the unlocked portal will reset thus changing its location. After 5 deaths, the game is over!</p>\n<p><strong>GOOD LUCK!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f28/f282668c2a22db3ed007ac1f3a8b2de6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rcolas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
