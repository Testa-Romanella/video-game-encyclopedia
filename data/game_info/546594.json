One of the teams names the trump and must then win the majority (3) of the tricks in that hand. The goal is to win at least three tricks. If the side that called the trump fails to get three tricks, it is said to be \"euchred\" or \"bumped\". Winning all five tricks is called a \\\"march.\\\" First team to 10 points wins.<br/><br/>BID EUCHRE<br/><br/>Bid Euchre is similiar to Euchre but rather than calling/passing on a face up card players take turns bidding how many cards they can get. Highest bid gets to call trump. The goal is to win at least as many tricks as bid. If the side that called the trump fails to get as many tricks as bid, it is said to be \"euchred\" or \"bumped\". Winning all six tricks is called a \\\"march.\\\" First team to 30 points wins.<br/><br/>TWO HANDED EUCHRE (1 V 1 Euchre)<br/><br/>Two Handed Euchre is one vs one  Each player gets 12 cards whomever calls suit must wins 7 tricks to avoid being Euchrered. Each trick taken counts as 1 point. The goal is to win at least as many tricks as bid. If the player that called the trump fails to get as many tricks as bid, it is said to be \"euchred or bumped\" and the opposing player receives 12 points. Winning all 12 tricks is called a \"march\".
