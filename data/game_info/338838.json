The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.</p>\n<p>Players soon discover that the\u00a0best play\u00a0from both parties leads to a\u00a0draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.</p>\n<p>Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a\u00a0pedagogical\u00a0tool for teaching the concepts of good\u00a0sportsmanship\u00a0and the branch of\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0that deals with the searching of\u00a0game trees. It is straightforward to write a\u00a0computer program\u00a0to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the\u00a0state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games\u00a0up torotations and reflections (the\u00a0game tree complexity) on this space.The game can be generalized to an\u00a0m,n,k-game\u00a0in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an\u00a0<em>m</em>\u00d7<em>n</em>\u00a0board, with the goal of getting\u00a0<em>k</em>\u00a0of their own color in a row.
