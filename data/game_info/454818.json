We have dedicated 6 months so far to the development of this game and we have plans to keep updating a few things so that it feels a bit more finished. We hope you have fun with this game as we have developing it.\u00a0 This game includes 4 mini games with different objectives or ways to play.</p>\n<p>Mini Games:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fosforito Shooter:</strong> A basketball game where you score based on how many hoops you get. The more you score, you may turn the basketball on fire and get double the points!</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Whack a Torch:</strong> The classic Whack a Mole, but with matches. Get that hammer and start whacking those matches!</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Catch of the Day:</strong> A relaxing fishing game. If you just want to relax and catch some fish, this mini game is for you. You will also receive score based on the type of fish you catch.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Color Shooter:</strong> A shooting game where you need to shoot some target with the matching bullet color. Shoot as many targets to get the best score!</li></ul>\n\n<p>Developers:</p>\n<ul><li>Shaira Avil\u00e9s: Programming, Art and\u00a0Modeling for Whack a Torch and Color Shooter.</li><li>Felix D\u00edaz: Music and SFX.</li><li>Angel Betancourt: Programming, Art and Modeling for Color Shooter and Fosforito Shooter.</li><li>Christian\u00a0Vives: Programming, Art and Modeling for Catch of the Day and Fosforito Shooter.</li></ul>\n<p>Extra thanks:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Jos\u00e9 Ramos: Music consultant and Capstone Professor</li><li>Fabiola V\u00e1zquez: Design consultant</li><li>Atlantic University College</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T03:11:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/539/539155aa3cf7a7a7d7f6922501ae848e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cvives652"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
