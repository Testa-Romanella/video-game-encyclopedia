And more importantly, he just doesn't see why he should care when there's plenty to see and do in the real world. But after being nudged into making an account and a close encounter with one of the stars of Virtuality's fighting arenas, Silver Phoenix, Alex may find that there is a whole lot more \"reality\" to Virtuality than he thought.</p><p><strong>Game Description:</strong></p><p>\"Virtuality\" is a non-commercial cyberpunk romance (BxG/B) visual novel.</p><p><strong>Game Features:</strong></p><ul><li>An original story and artwork</li><li>Animated backgrounds</li><li>A dynamic story featuring 2 routes, \"real-life\" and \"virtual\" and 4+ endings</li><li>Approximately 3 hours of gameplay for 1 each route</li></ul><p><strong>Game Staff:</strong></p><ul><li>Director                                    Katta</li><li>Writer                                      Tanya Rodgers</li><li>Artist                                        FeliceMelancholie</li><li>CG artist                                  Rena Illusion</li><li>Background artist                    Badriel</li><li>Gui art and programming       Anne</li><li>Music                                      Creative Commons</li><li>Engine                                    Ren'py</li></ul><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p>Game development blog</p><p>Lemmasoft thread</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/5574852cb20940910a6f954b9074717b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Katta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
