But after a while, he abandoned that project because he was still learning, and the mess he had created became too much to fix.<br/></p>\n<p>After several years, his love for that game never died, and he took some time to try his hand at it again with a brand new style and years of practice under his belt. So here it is, Magister Ludi. A First Person adventure game (demo) with comedic undertones and a voxel based art style, Magister Ludi is a quick venture into the mechanics of what <em>COULD</em> become a project proper if enough people would want to play more from his passionate mind.</p>\n<p><em>Note: We cannot understate that this a\u00a0<strong>short</strong> demo. This has only been in production for 3 weeks, and is just going out to gauge interest and gather feedback on the concepts. Comments are encouraged and criticism is heard, but this project was designed and built by one person (besides the music), so kindness is also appreciated.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T13:47:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38d/38dd4ec7cd5a607d1b86fa17110b6722.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tsar-Dev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
