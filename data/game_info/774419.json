The theme was \"Dreams/Dreaming\".</p>\n<p><em>The seemingly calm and uninspired Rinnosuke Morichika is actually a highly romantic man in his dreams.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Doremy Sweet, a bored baku who has been looking for a source of excitement in the Dream World, decides to help him by organising a Dream World-brand matchmaking session.</em></p>\n<p><em>...Although</em>, <em>it seems as if she did not consider whether Rinnosuke himself is compatible with the wonderful lady she selected. Danmaku ensues!<br/></em>I pretty much rushed the game to meet the 4-day deadline, so there are a lot of imperfections and unfinished stuff everywhere. I may put out a post-jam update, but for now, please enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Engine: Touhou Danmakufu ph3sx by </strong>mkm (original ph3 source code) and Natashinitai (ph3sx fork)</p>\n<p><strong>Fonts:</strong> Unispace, Connecting Chain Handserif, Cirno, MS Gothic</p>\n<p><strong>Code: </strong>Kevinmonitor (me)</p>\n<p><strong>Art, Sprites, Bullet Graphics and Music:\u00a0</strong>Kevinmonitor (me)</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects: </strong>Kevinmonitor (me), made in bfxr</p>\n<p><strong>...Pretty much everything, really (except for fonts lol): </strong>Kevinmonitor (me)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks: Megapig9001, Nutty, and the Touhou Game Dev Server </strong>for helping out with some story elements.<br/></p><p><strong>BASIC CONTROLS: </strong>(it works like any other Touhou-style shoot-em-up, really...)</p><p>Arrow Keys: Movement/Select\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Z: Fire/Confirm (hold Z for rapid-fire)\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p><p> X: Use Spell Card (limited use)/Cancel\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Esc (while in-game): Pause</p><p>Shift (hold): Enter Focus Mode.</p>\n<p>During Focus Mode, your hitbox becomes visible, you move significantly slower, and your shot becomes more concentrated (usually).</p>\n<p>It is **incredibly** helpful for dodging large, dense waves of bullets, so please use it whenever things get too tight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T21:53:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/accc4cbf9f40195d843c134918cb6e88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Mink"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
