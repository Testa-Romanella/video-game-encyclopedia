Mine, craft, and build to hold off ever-increasing waves of these black zombie-like creatures. You\u2019ll face new enemy types and must consistently adapt new strategies to hold them off.<br/><br/>You, an all-purpose care robot, are awakened by an emergency SOS signal. You head to the surface to intercept an escape pod plummeting from space, and you open it to find... A baby. A human baby.<br/><br/>Your mission protocols were updated to protect the child, though you aren\u2019t sure why. Your memory banks must be malfunctioning. As the sun begins to fall, you make haste to prepare for when they come.<br/><br/>First, let's dive underground and mine to collect a variety of materials. You can use these resources to craft new goods and process ores, etc. at the Workbench and Forge, respectively. You\u2019ll need to buy time until sunrise or lay many traps to handle the many enemies you face. <br/><br/>You can upgrade your skills and unlock new items and traps with ENGRAMS. These will be obtained primarily when you defeat enemies.<br/><br/>Using traps will require huge amounts of resources, so aim to begin your production lines early. Use a Chemistry Station to create Trap Fuel, and connect it to the Supply Depot to start supplying your traps.<br/><br/>The enemies only attack at night, and your character cannot attack. Prepare carefully.<br/><br/>Check the guide or find the Tips pages in-game to learn more!<br/><br/>- Steam achievements<br/>- Additional quest in the game (We are considering adding stories etc. by satisfying specific conditions)<br/>- New traps and enemy<br/>- Tutorial and/or Tips page<br/>- Key configuration (gameplay using controller)<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T06:05:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/531/5315c90aabd9b450a126f39b958a6891.jpg", "website": "https://www.flypenguin.jp/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fly Penguin"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fly Penguin"], "esrb_rating": null}
