Do you have the right reflexes and the right amount of patience to overcome every trial?</p>\n<p>The game was developed by me in GameMaker: Studio as a little side project; there was no dedicated artist involved, therefore external assets (song, sounds and graphics) have been used - each source is promptly credited in-game or in this page.</p>\n<p>I will be glad to work along with an artist as I continue the game's development, giving the game the original and consistent graphic style it deserves.</p>\n<p><em>N.B.: plug out any controller you might have should you notice huge desync between the screen lyrics and the song itself! Also, F4 for fullscreen.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Demo is available for free.</strong> If you like it, please talk about it with your friends, leave feedback and, if possible, consider supporting the game with a little donation!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>That Handsome Devil for the \"Charlie's Inferno\" track</li><li>Urser (YouTube) for snapshots from the Fan Video</li><li>FreeSound.org for sound effects</li><li>OpenGameArt.org for graphical assets</li><li>Random stock pictures</li><li>My brother Francesco for continuous\u00a0testing throughout the game's development</li><li>Davide Jos\u00e9 Paci as the game's developer (me!)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:24:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3c/c3c9e505decc54d5c390c24c4a0505a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Davide Jos\u00e9 Paci"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
