The player (Plumber) has no clue where he is, riddled with confusion as if his memory had been completely wiped preceding this moment. The primary aim of the game is to escape, ultimately figuring out why the city is constructed with innumerable pipes and other plumbing fixtures. Embarking on the journey through the forest of pipes, the player represents a plumber who has to complete many timed tasks using his pipe wrench tool, i.e. fixing pipes, turning valves, and finding missing parts/items throughout the game. Completing sets of tasks will eventually uncover the truth. With the completion of tasks, he gradually remembers minor parts of his lost memory and his surroundings slowly turn sinister. The game concludes when the player reaches the end and steps through a glowing mirror presented by a naiad.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n\n<p>. WASD - Movement<br/>.
