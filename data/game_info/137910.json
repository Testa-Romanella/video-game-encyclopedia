I don\u2019t have much game developing or programming experience, but decided to try out a game jam to test myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Samuel\u2019s Escape</strong> is a platforming game, where you play as Samuel the Slime, a brave explorer who has found himself trapped in a dangerous pit. He must climb to safety, avoiding spikes and collecting coins.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t try to do something too inventive, since I would probably fail miserably due to my lack of experience. I also didn\u2019t manage to do all the levels and features I had planned before the deadline, but rules are rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've started releasing updates and bugfixes, so if you want to rate the game for Ludum Dare use the first two links.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music Credit</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u201cKillers\u201d Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e95/e955f0f4b75c2cb4a386096d9fe84958.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Paco"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
