He wakes up in a world filled with zombies roaming the streets for brains and content, and deduces that there might be a way to bring people back. But does the end justify the means? Maybe getting your brain eaten isn't so bad...</p>\n\n<p>This game is based off a dream I had, which probably says a lot about how my subconscious perceives talking to people I\u00a0don't know. It's the first game that I've ever actually completed, and I\u00a0did it in about two weeks for NaNoReNo 2022. It's only like ~15 minutes long, but I\u00a0hope it's enjoyable.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Script Scribe - Briny the Elder</p>\n<p>Character Artist Character - Briny the Elder</p>\n<p>Architect of Backgrounds - Briny the Elder</p>\n<p>Chief Mixologist - @brinkybeats</p>\n<p>Spooky Tone Generator - Blomstervikinger the Slightly Lesser</p>\n<p>VP of Quality Engineering - P.
