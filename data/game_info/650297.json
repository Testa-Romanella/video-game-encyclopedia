There are 30 levels in this game (with no music if you want a quiet time while playing). You will already have access to all 30 levels within the menu so feel free to choose any level or play through them all as you like it.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move left - arrow key [&lt;] or [A] key ---\u00a0Move right -\u00a0arrow key [&gt;] or [D] key.</p>\n<p>Press the [space bar] to Jump.</p>\n<p>Press the [escape] key to return to the menu.</p>\n<p>More Info on game N Blank:</p>\n<p>This game is for\u00a0experimentation on mechanics &amp; I will soon release another game for free next time. Do expect that this game will have janky controls when playing &amp;, out of whack collisions (Also expect a whole lotta bright colors that \"might\" burn your eyes, it sure burned my eyes when making this game).</p>\n<p>These levels are very easy to finish however if you were to get stuck on a level\u00a0(somehow) then, you can press the escape key\u00a0to return to the main menu.</p>\n<p>Any comments on my game, whether it be positive or negative (I mostly need negative comments). To help me improve on what I could work on harder in the future.</p>\n<p>Don't expect a game like mine to be fun, I'm sure it would be un-fun when playing my game. If things don't go as you like it, you can always refund the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T08:40:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db5/db51b8a2318ce4cacf943899bf6741fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlankNReady"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
