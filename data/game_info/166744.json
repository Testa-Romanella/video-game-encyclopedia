You are in control of a cat with seasonal affective disorder who is tring to find its way through the emotions that the seasons can bring.</p><p>SADCAT employs VR in a unique way that is difficult to describe and even more difficult to believe until you try it. The VR headset is used not as a simple view-port but as a fundamental mechanic of the game: by changing your perspective, you change the way in which you can move around the world. SADCAT is complemented by an thick, engrossing atmosphere borne from a beautiful soundtrack and visuals.</p><p>SADCAT came joint-first by audience vote at the Shalyla VR Jam 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark and was exhibited at the Creative Coast Festival in Karlshamn, Sweden and at A MAZE  Johannesburg 2016!</p><p>SADCAT is currently in a prototype state.
