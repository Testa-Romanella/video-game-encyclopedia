While doing so, each player must also protect his own flag ship from enemy fighters and other hazard that may be present. Players must also be careful from destroying his own fleet as a result of friendly fires.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is designed to be played by two players on a single computer.\u00a0 There is a built-in A.I. for a one-player game.\u00a0 However, there is still some bugs which affects the turn sequence.\u00a0 One particular bug is when you destroy all of your opponent's fighter ship.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are also currently working on making it more Mobile device friendly.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We will appreciate it very much if you can play test our game and point other bugs in the system.</p>\n<p>Rules:</p>\n<p>- Player must destroy his opponents Mothership in order to win.</p>\n<p>- On a player's turn, he must select a ship (including the Mothership) by clicking on it.</p>\n<p>- Once a ship is selected, the player can press Left or Right arrow key to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p>- In order to fire, the player must charge his canon by pressing the F key and releasing it.\u00a0 The player can monitor the power level on the top of the screen.\u00a0 The higher the power, the longer the range of the attack.\u00a0 However, if the player charge his canon beyond 100 (red bar on the monitor\u00a0), there is a possibility that his ship will be destroyed.</p>\n<p>- Kamikaze attack.\u00a0 When you spawn a ship exactly where there is an enemy ship, you will score a Kamikaze attack.\u00a0 This will give you an extra turn.\u00a0 You can select another ship (including the one you have previously used) and attack again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T10:09:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c0/6c0dd903ac1453b555c28f6d222d0fa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["baodingball"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
