A tournament held by the evil Dominion of Wrestling, an evil mega-corporation that wants to be the only company in the wrestling world! There they hope to win the Grand Heavyweight Championship Gauntlet and save their hometowns.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But first, they have to get there!\r\n</p>\n<p>Lots of other competitors are also on their way so Jonny and Fury Rose need to hurry if they hope to get a spot.\" <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Background:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This is a Top Down Shmup that I made to build up to \"Dogs of War\" proper. The idea here, like wrestling PPV previews entitled \"Road To\"s, is to introduce players to the characters in the proper game which will have actual <em>Wrestling</em>, <em>Beat'em up</em>, and <em>Shmup </em>sections.</p>\n<p>The game has already undergone market testing with a publisher. Unfortunately, it tested well with a crowd they were not interested in (18-40-year-olds) so they decided not to fund it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Status:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is in <em>Alpha</em> currently with a taste of Jonny and Fury Rose's campaign. <br/></p>\n<p><em>Boss Battles</em> have not been implemented as my programmer had to return to work full time and our deadline was coming up. <br/>Though there is a video explainer of how Boss Battles would work when completed.<br/></p>\n<p>The <em>Combo</em> system is not fully implemented but is present. The Scoring is not present at this moment and neither are lives so players can retry as much as they want.</p>\n<p><em>Menus </em>are functional through final features are not. Pause menu graphics are buggy but they all work as intended.</p>\n<p>There is a <em>Mobile Demo</em> for Android 11 on the Play store which should also be linked.</p>\n<p><strong>Plans:</strong></p>\n<p>I hope to be able to finish this game and release it so that I can feel right about starting on Dogs of War proper but have found I would need funding. I would love to continue working on it myself but I know it would take SIGNIFICANTLY longer to do and free help is very unreliable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All donations made will go to a fund that will be used to further the development of this game such as paying for labor, releases on consoles, and prepping additional content such as other wrestlers (Some of which are local to El Paso, Eddie Guerrero's hometown) to appear in the game, and merch like replica masks, shirts, toys keychains, etc.<br/></p>\n<p>If you would like to participate in this project feel free to send me a message or leave a comment below on where I can contact you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T11:04:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/412c37ed5d31121a63666c9d0e465329.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["H4Design"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
