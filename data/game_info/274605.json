Be patient.</em><br/></p>\r\nSacrifices are necessary!\r\n<p>In this colorful side-scrolling shooter, you will blast waves of enemies whilst only having\u00a0limited power! Experience the need for strategic sacrifices as conditions impose the need for certain stats.</p>\n<p>Right click on your reactor (gizmo thingy to the right) to modify stats, including Shield, Cooling Power, Elemental Power, Guns and Repair.</p>\n<p>Additionally, on the game board is a bunch of tiles. Hold right click over a tile to enable it. Once enabled, the turrets can fire towards that tile.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>You can only shoot at active tiles; to target an enemy out of range, hold right-click to toggle on a tile. This way, aiming requires power!</strong><br/></p>\r\nThings to know:\r\n<p><strong>Left-click</strong> to fire<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Right-click</strong> to interact with the reactor and environment.</p>\n<p>Orange enemies can be damaged with normal projectiles, however blue enemies require elemental power. Increase the elemental stat to be able to damage blue enemies.</p>\n<p>Certain configurations of stats are useful in different scenarios, and changing configurations will require sacrifice!</p>\n<p>All stats and active tiles consume power. Ensure you don't go over your power supply.</p>\n<p><strong>This game was made for Ludum Dare 43 for the Compo (Solo) challenge in 48 hours. The theme was; Sacrifices must be made.</strong></p>\n\r\nPlay around with statistics, but don't go over the power limit!\r\n\r\nKeep up with the pace, including enemies, bullets and heaps of particles!\r\n\r\nGet cool, random backgrounds!\r\n\r\nA Note on Versions\r\n<p>After the formal submission and deadline of Ludum Dare, a severe bug was found which\u00a0<strong>prevented\u00a0</strong>effective play of the game. The problem was that upon dying, the cursor would be absorbed, invisible and not functioning;\u00a0<strong>locking off the game</strong>. In Version 1.1, this has been fixed by adding a single line of code. To act as a comparison, the initially submitted version is available for download, listed as \"Reactor Overdrive dl v1.0\".\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e0/2e04195206f72487b775a331f06e4bb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JUSTCAMH"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
