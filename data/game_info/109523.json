Suddenly a pigeon flew over him and managed to poop directly into his mug.</p><p>This event inspired us to use the Leap Motion Controller and allow players to enter a bird's perspective and try this challenge for themselves.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5b/f5b53e91f932e46eed7c6993a3c4e90a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BongoMongo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
