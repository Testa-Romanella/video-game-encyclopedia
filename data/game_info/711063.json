Our engineers will follow your blimp force into the clouds, to establish a bridgehead against the drone menace and protect the ecosystem of our floating legacy.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Lead our forces into the skies and secure the floating islands before drones arrive!<br/></li><li> Build extractors to collect resources, power generators to keep everything running, and farms to keep the pilotsunder your command fed!<br/></li><li> Prepare for the inevitable assault! From the drones! The sky drones! DRONES!</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>The enemy will not stand, er, float idly by. These islands carry a wealth of resources that will supercharge the enemy drone production. We can\u2019t let that happen!<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Defend your mining operations with turrets, lots and lots  of turrets.<br/></li><li> Gather uridium from the wreckage to bolster the bridgehead and expand it.<br/></li><li> Defend the islands and ensure precious duraphyte does not wind up in enemy hands. Tentacles. Appendages? They have tentacles btw.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Once your team's blimps are bristling with lethal weapons,take the fight to the enemy. Destroy them all and let the scrappers sort them out!<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Upgrade your blimp and put the fear of blue-screens in those dastardly drones.<br/></li><li> Push back the enemy with your team back to their base where they belong.<br/></li><li> Ensure a swift and definitive victory by taking down their base to eliminate the drone threat once and for all!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T14:07:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c9/5c946b3b86d8663269b4bec8676c797f.jpg", "website": "http://skyfleet.io/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 25, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Enno  Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freedom Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
