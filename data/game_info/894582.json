Meanwhile, a young woman finds herself swept up by the dark side of city politics, and farmers tending fields of vat-grown flesh contend with the arrival of dead bodies in their meaty crop.<br/>Out at sea and far from civilization, an expedition discovers an ancient tomb-ship, a drifting monument to the sleeping dead, set on its endless voyage centuries earlier. Therein, something stirs...<br/><br/>The world may have ended, but humanity persists in all its triumph and tragedy, there among the twisting flames of the Burning Sea.<br/><br/>Please Note: This product is a digital book, packaged and presented via a game engine.
