Your job is to maintain balance in the ecosystem, and create long surviving bugs. End-game goal is to have a family of bugs to live for 15 minutes or more.<br/>Downloadable version recommended, since better performance allows for more crowded aquarium.</p>\n<p>Having trouble keeping bugs alive? Here's some tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Remember to buy plants! They are on second page of the shop (tab Other). Without them the bugs suffocate</li><li>Get money by selling bugs - don't be afraid to sell big part of the population</li><li>Healthy bugs with long lineage sell for best prices</li><li>Once you have enough money, try setting plants on autobuy, and set minimum amount quite high, so that plants have some chance to succeed - sell bugs to control population</li><li>Save different kind of bugs to solve different situations - for example, get some predators if population explodes</li><li>Making balanced ecosystem is not easy! Don't be afraid to sell all the bugs and start from scratch with good amount of money :)</li></ul>\n<p>Note: There's bug (he he) when restarting game, money won't restart - this is nice if you have some, but sooner one restarts game when money is gone. So restarting actually requires reloading the game. Saved bugs should be preserved even during reload.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T04:59:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6e/c6e73baaf4cda3f07fe01bf8fc633faf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["AxU", "Mubsi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
