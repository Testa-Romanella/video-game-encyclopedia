Remember: bringing something unrequested to your altar will make the deity very sad.</p>\n<p>The wrath of any god will affect the whole village: beware of Achtla's fire walls (they will ostruct your path) and Ezqui's electric fields (they'll destroy your offering if you step on them).</p>\n<p>When your deity's satisfaction bar reaches zero, the other cult prevails and you lose.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the game and praise the Snek :)<br/><br/>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/praise-the-snek</p>\n<p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p>\n<p>2 players\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p>\n<p>keyboard / controller</p>\n<p>\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6</p>\n<p>GAME DESIGN \u25c6 Marina Andreose, Demetrio Zachary Tagliapietra<br/>3D ART &amp;\u00a0VFX \u25c6 Stefano Bertolin, Mattia Ceretta<br/>PROGRAMMING \u25c6 Demetrio Zachary Tagliapietra<br/>2D ART &amp; UI \u25c6 Marina Andreose</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/883/883cebed5aac1b1904641a47dd6db28e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Preside"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
