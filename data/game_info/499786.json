It was built using RPG Maker MV, but MZ users can play it as well. Just keep in mind that Plugin Commands with MZ are slightly different from MV (MZ's are easier to use).<br/></p>\n<p>At the current version, the sample project contains the following plugins:</p>\n<ul><li>TAA_BookMenu</li><li>TAA_CharacterPoses</li><li>TAA_MapTitleScreen*</li><li>TAA_EnemyReinforcements*</li><li>TAA_SkillMastery*</li></ul>\n<p>The ones marked with a * are not yet supported on MZ. Their porting is in progress, please be patient!</p>\n<p><strong>Special disclaimer for TAA_CharacterPoses</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a powerful yet complex plugin to use. The events on the map dedicated to it are loaded with comments to help you make sense of how it works. Please be sure to check them out!</p>\n<p>One other thing: this plugin relies heavily on edited sprite assets. So, I've included a few of them which I've edited myself (I've used whtdragon's templates as a starting point). If you eventually decide to use my edits on your own project, be sure to follow whtdragon's terms of use. You also need to own a copy of RPG Maker MV, as they're all RTP edits.<br/></p>\n<p>On my end, as long as you respect this terms you're free to use as you like (credit is not required, but appreciated!).</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>The sample project use mostly MV's RTP resources, unless stated otherwise (like with TAA_CharacterPoses, as I described above). As long as you own a copy of RPG Maker MV, you're allowed to use them as you like in games made with RPG Maker.</p>\n<p>Any special credits are given within the credits.txt file.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T04:24:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fc/0fcd37e855e606fb5e70680bca347739.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["taaspider"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
