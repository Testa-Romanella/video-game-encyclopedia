No, we don't trade woodland creatures, we trade in rocks and nuts and stories and chill forest vibes.

Other than quests, all major gameplay systems in the final design are present but untuned and occasionally a bit rough. Up next is the quest system followed by several rounds of content production and polish.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T12:07:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b290df1615d3f8fa1e22397f0e743ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Schultz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
