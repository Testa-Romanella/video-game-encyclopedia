{"id": 375270, "slug": "cat-mouse", "name": "CAT & MOUSE", "name_original": "CAT & MOUSE", "description": "Cat &amp; Mouse is a fast paced, asymmetrical, multiplayer game where you play a game of well.. cat and mouse.  One team plays as Predators and the other team play as the Prey.  Predators hunt the Prey to stop them from scoring points and the Prey try to avoid being decimated by their hunters and score enough points before the time runs out.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt the start of Early Access the only Predator and Prey types are cats and mice. As the game develops we plan to add more variation to the types of predators and prey you can choose from.  Currently the next addition to playable characters will be a Predator in the form of a Barn Owl (just to give you an idea of what we are planning).  There is also one house as the starting level; however this will be the first change, as we plan to create many levels/ play areas because playing the same level over and over can get tedious.  There are several more changes coming and a roadmap with planned changes coming as well. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThanks for playing Cat &amp; Mouse! We seriously appreciate it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T03:07:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b53/b53783bfe55468eda1c43c3f3f6cef2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob G"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jacob G"], "esrb_rating": null}
