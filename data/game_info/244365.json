There you can place walls (press 1) or buttons\u00a0(press 2) by left-clicking. Neither of these things do anything (Like I said, it's a prototype).\u00a0 Right click to remove an object or click 'reset' to remove everything. You can't remove objects once you have exited the tile mode and entered again (Again, it's a prototype). Press 'switch to map-mode' to switch to map mode where you can place the tile you just made anywhere on the map. The player starts at the blue dot and ends at the red dot. The red dot currently doesn't do anything (you know why by now)\u00a0</p>\n<p>The objective is supposed to be\u00a0that one of the players creates a level and the other plays it. Then player 2 creates a level and player 1 plays it. Whoever beat the others level fastest wins!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38e/38ebb21ea39e88470196d0a466771b0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joll05"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
