Roast and serve BBQ skewers, para-drop passengers, clean knee-high piles of barf at 30 000 feet and so on! <br/><br/><br/><br/>The twin sister founders of Wleft Airlines have a bold plan: assemble the most efficient (and eccentric) team of cabin attendants one can find and take over the world, route by route. Offer cabin services never before attempted - for a good reason! Hustle like no cabin crew has hustled before! Luxury before safety! Wleft Airlines really needs you and your friends to help them. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Even though it might look like total chaos, the day-to-day grind of a cabin crew is really a well tuned and highly organized operation. Before the passengers arrive and mess it all up, that is. But no matter how ungrateful they are or how unreasonable their demands are, the crew has to make it work. Everybody has a job to do, whether it be preparing, serving, scrubbing, herding, strapping and so on. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Each of the cabin crew has a different special ability and different outlook on life. For example, becoming a flight attendant was a natural option for Mr Yrman after getting fed up being a prison guard. Yrman knows how to make his way through a crowded airplane aisle. He's is also a passionate knitter. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Whatever you do, you just need one button to do it. And I'm not counting directional controls. Nor the sprint button. And oh, I'm also forgetting single-player character switch control... which reminds me...<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's also fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T03:33:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b0/4b0aa5ef60aa77a76ca460551ee09257.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Animera Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Animera Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
