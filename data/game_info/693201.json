Our chosen game mechanic was the grappling hook and our goal was to integrate it into a small project. The game consisted of 2 programmers and 3 designers and this was our first game project where we worked in smaller teams.</p>\n<p>This was being developed just when the pandemic hit Sweden (late 2020) and all the higher educations had to close down and the students had to work from home. This presented several issues such as not having the best equipment and computer to work on and not having learned version control properly yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The focus was on getting the grappling mechanic to work as intended and that is something we managed to fulfill but the rest of the game got affected by both the pandemic and various other external issues at the time. The game is in an unpolished state as a result but it is possible to complete the game even if it seems impossible. If someone, for some reason, wants to try the game, we suggest you turn off the audio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T07:10:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/401/4012b4f52161ea353f70d93abbedbf3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["markstrm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
