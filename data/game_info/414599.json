Use these attributes to guide the space shuttle through space!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>You do everything using the Mouse and the Left Mouse Button<br/>Place/Select Black Holes: Mouse 0<br/>Fire Space Shuttle: Hold and Drag Mouse 0, release to fire</p>\n<p>We know that the fourth (and currently last) level is very difficult, but trust us: it is possible.
