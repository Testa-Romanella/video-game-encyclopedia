In fact, everything is spinning at that speed because the whole Earth is spinning! Everything Spins in space, which makes it quite difficult to navigate!\u00a0Good thing your ship can spin too ;)</p>\n<p>Spin Star is a simple high score game where you visit rapidly rotating planets and satellites to gain points. Made for the 2021 Kenney Game Jam, I'm pretty proud of how it turned out.</p>\n<p>Quick Credits:</p>\n<p>Thanks to @KenneyNL for hosting this game jam and creating a plethora of awesome assets to use!</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Phaser 3\u00a0Devs for building a very cool Javascript Game Engine!</p>\n<p>Thanks to @LouieZong for the music!
