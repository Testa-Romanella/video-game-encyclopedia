Players guide the roots of their plant as it grows through the soil, modifying its appearance as it goes. Not all tilled earth is the same, the field is filled with strange objects that will effect how the plant grows. It will take a combination of skill, planning, and a little luck for players to grow the perfect fruit for their customer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Designers\r\n</p>\n<p>Sam Reinhart\r\n</p>\n<p>Andy An\r\n</p>\n<p>Josh Knapp\r\n</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Sam Reinhart\r\n</p>\n<p>Programmers\r\n</p>\n<p>Tyler J.
