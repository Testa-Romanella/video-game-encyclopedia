The droid garage is the only spot for lightyears to repair broken space ships and continue adventuring.</p>\n<p>Control a bunch of droid and repair the space ships that are being brought to your garage.</p>\n<p>To save energy there is only one active power core that must be shared between the droid. So only one can be active at any given time. Don't worry, droids don't get lonely. At least that's what I've been told.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A/D or Left/Right: Walk</p>\n<p>W or Up: Jump 83D Printer is too heavy to jump :)</p>\n<p>E: Do some work</p>\n<p>Q: Switch to closest(highlighted) droid</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do I do?</strong></p>\n<p>Each droid has a different speciality to\u00a0perform a task. Those are:</p>\n<ul><li>Cutting (Red)</li><li>Glueing (White)</li><li>Lifting (Console to the right)</li><li>and 3d Printing from recycled materials (Yellow)</li></ul>\n<p>The tasks will periodically glow in a light blue. If the right droid is active and at the spot you can do the work until the progress bar has filled. Then usually a new task will show up that\u00a0needs a different skill.</p>\n<p>Once all tasks are done the ship is repaired and you've won the game (for now).</p>\n<p>This isn't really a puzzle game, nor are there any time limitations to put pressure\u00a0on you (yet). It's more meant to spend some time with a bunch of droids and get some work done.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, Art by Noskro</p>\n<p>Music and Sounds:\u00a0https://freesound.org/</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was done for the\u00a0LM0B Beginners Game Jam #26. Due to different circumstances and bad panning I had way less time than I hoped for. So a lot of things are rushed at the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The is also only one level and no real scoring mechanism. I hope to find the time to fix those things in the future. So if you like the game in general let me know and I'll finish and expand the game later on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:32:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37c/37cd9ac607b79535f74675da8353d095.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noskro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
