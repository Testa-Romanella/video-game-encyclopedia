During the game, random items appear in a 3x3 grid, and the player must click the best items in order to keep the pet's hunger level from reaching maximum and ending the game. Sometimes, it is necessary to choose unwanted items on purpose in order to make room for new, good items, and learning when to take those losses at the right times is important to staying in the game longer. If you end up with all bad options, then clicking the \"SCRATCH\" button will scratch the board clear and reveal new options. The goal of the game is to keep the hunger bar from reaching maximum for as long as possible.<h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Handcrafted Pixel Art Pets<br/></li><li>Simple Gameplay Mechanics<br/></li><li>Retro Style<br/></li><li>Family-Friendly</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T04:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc1/fc136698d1fdeb9c9e91f98d98ddad7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J.C.
