Once you complete the level you complete the game and play again as much as you want. After you finish level 3 you can skip to level 4 if you lose. Thank you for checking out my game, and tell me how it went.</p>\n<p>WASD/ Arrow Keys For Windows Version</p>\n<p>Project Files and Code Available at github.com/2K0Games/Sky-Ball</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T07:17:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd3/dd3719adea4366ae721c1a8f780bb3b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2K0 Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
