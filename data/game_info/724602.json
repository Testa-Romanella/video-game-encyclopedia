A game that is going to be submitted to the March Conference for the WTSA\u00a0Video Game Design\u00a0Competition. The demo is currently unfinished but we are going to submit this for now for the January 20th deadline as we are kind of tight on time.<br/><br/>Originally there were supposed to be enemies but I got stuck on programming the state machine\u00a0(A sort of enemy AI) and I don't have time to dwell on that problem since the deadline is really very very close. Ain't going to take that risk.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T07:31:08", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RandomDevBoi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
