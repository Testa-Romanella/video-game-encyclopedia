I'm sure other objects in this place yearn for sweet, sweet freedom\u2026<br/>This fiend always tries to lock you down in his house. How Cruel ! He thinks you\u2019re bound to him just because you can be of use. Tsk\u2026 He has no conscience at all ! You\u2019re not an object without emotions, how can he not think of what we\u2019re going through to please him.<br/>You have your pride and want to escape his grasp by all means, but your little friends are a bit afraid and less strong headed as you are. They will gladly follow you if you can guarantee their safety. If your owner sees them, they will be scared and flee where they can\u2019t be seen anymore. You will have to persuade them once again by talking and going to get them.</p>\n<p>Be careful not to get caught and lead your friends to freedom through the sewer and the world beyond !<br/><br/>Credits :\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Prog</strong>\u00a0:\u00a0Kirill Dorovskikh<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 L\u00e9o Veyssiere</p>\n<p><strong>Level Design</strong>: Valentin Mathieu</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Design</strong>:\u00a0Pierre Duchesne-B\u00e9n\u00e9teau</p>\n<p><strong>Game artists</strong>\u00a0: William Dujardin</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Salom\u00e9 Duboscq</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Camille Jarry\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/799992841d8b9e5aab96878a6e09efdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nysthiel", "HarmonySeeker", "SassoHH", "WD Liblyx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
