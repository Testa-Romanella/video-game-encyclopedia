While her grandmother recovers from a recent accident, she'll spend the week manning the store. It's all good though. Because if everything goes well she'll earn just enough money from her time working there to finally pack up and leave her dump of a hometown. All she has to do is make it through the next week and she'll be well on her way to greener pastures. A simple enough task on its own but not so much when circumstances throw a few uncalled for coworkers into the equation.</p><p><strong>DEMO FEATURES:</strong><br/>\u2022 13,800+ words/ Over an hour of gameplay<br/>\u2022 Three out of seven days in game playable<br/>\u2022 Two possible romance interest<br/></p><p><strong>Cereza Jones </strong> AGE:21<br/>The main character of the story who's now the not so proud manager of Angie's Mart. She doesn't have the best relationship with her hometown and is looking forward to moving on with her life. Cerezas' sharp tongue and no nonsense attitude has gotten her in a fair amount of trouble but it's nothing she can't handle. </p><p><strong>Jun Jie Sun </strong> AGE:20<br/>Jun Jie recently moved to the town and hasn't been working at the shop very long but seems to be on good terms with everyone. Especially the neighborhood children, who often ask him to join in on their daily games. A happy go lucky guy, he tends to acts like a big kid, much to Cerezas' chagrin. </p><p><strong>Kameron Hawthorne </strong> AGE:23<br/>Kameron has known Cereza ever since his family emigrated from Martinique and opened a Caribbean bakery next door to her grandmother's' shop. He often works long hours but always makes it a point to stop by and deliver fresh pastries every morning to Angie's Mart. Considerate and kind he goes out of his way to help anyone in need. Which would be great\u2026if he wasn't constantly letting everyone take advantage of him.</p><p><strong>Rafael Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez Dom\u00ednguez </strong> AGE:19<br/>To say Rafael is a tough nut to crack would be an understatement. His flippant attitude and negative outlook towards most things in life tends to keep others at a distance. It's a wonder how he even managed to get a job working the night shift at Angie's Mart.</p><p><strong>WRITERS: </strong>Ellisama | Ferdokki | Hazel-Bun<br/><strong>PROGRAMMER: </strong> Marionette<br/><strong>BACKGROUND ARTIST: </strong> Lareon<br/><strong>SPRITES, GUI, &amp; CGS: </strong> kingv</p><p><em>Please Note: This game was created as part of <em>NaNoRenO </em>2016 and at this point in time is a demo only.
