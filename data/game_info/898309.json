In order to do this, you spend your days going around collecting candy requests from NPCs, gathering ingredients by foraging in the surrounding lands, and making candies in your shop. By completing your customers' requests, your infamy grows and new candy recipes unlock. But beware, by accepting more requests than you have the ability to complete, your infamy will decrease and your shop will be forced to close!</p>\n<p>Character interaction with dialogue is required to obtain candy requests, which are then listed on the side of your screen. Collecting ingredients is done by playing one of two types of minigames. Making candies is a system of simple clicks selecting your ingredients and the recipe you want before the candy appears in your inventory. A clock in the corner of the screen keeps track of how much time you have each day to do all of these activities; by completing your customers' requests within the time frame, your infamy meter increases and new candy recipes unlock that can be obtained from NPCs. However, by accepting more requests than you have the ability to complete in time, your infamy meter decreases. Win the game by completely filling the infamy meter.</p>\n<p>Make sure to\u00a0watch our trailer\u00a0and thanks for playing!</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Follow us on Twitter!</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Classroom Studio:</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T17:44:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fb/7fb955fbd57fec213d38a9ebd3755f91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["HalloWeenies"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
