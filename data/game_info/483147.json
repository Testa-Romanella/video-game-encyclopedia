Whenever you attack a monster, you play a round of Whist with them!</p>\n<p>Made In 1 Week (48 non consecutive hour)\u00a0for the Miz Game Jam 1.\u00a0 Please let me know if you discover any bugs!</p>\n<p>___________________</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> - Move Character</p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys</strong> - Change Selection</p>\n<p><strong>Enter</strong> - Confirm Selection</p>\n<p>____________________</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>At the beginning of each floor, you are dealt a number of random cards. The remainder of the cards are dealt amongst the enemies on the floor.\u00a0The top right box shows your hand of cards, and the box below this shows\u00a0the 8 most recently played cards. You can change which card you have selected with the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Move around the floor with WASD and collect gems. Stand on the ladder to advance to the next floor.\u00a0When you move towards a spot occupied by a monster, you and the monster will play your currently selected cards. Whoever's card has the highest value will succeed in\u00a0damaging the other. If the played cards are of the same value, neither takes damage.</p>\n<p>If an enemy attacks you without you attacking that enemy, that enemies attack will always hit. Conversely if you attack an enemy who isn't attacking you, your attack will always hit.</p>\n<p>If a monster runs out of cards, it will be unable to attack. However, if you run<br/>out of cards, neither can you!</p>\n<p>Be careful, some monsters are stronger than others. Green enemies are the weakest and red are the strongest</p>\n<p>For tactical play, remember that monsters always use their highest value<br/>cards first, and that there is only one of each card per floor. You can also see the most recently played cards, so use this to your advantage</p>\n<p>Go for high-score to unlock alternate colour palettes!</p>\n<p>______________________</p>\n<p>If you want to have a look at the code, its open source at\u00a0https://github.com/matthew-bvrn/Miz-Game-Jam\u00a0- A warning though, game jam's don't make for good code!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a26a67427ec71636b99eaa0a9de60b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hacktic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
