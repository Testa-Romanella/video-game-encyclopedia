Gear up, gather your crew (or not), and get ready to chow down on cheese-themed content. Are you ready for the challenge of a lifetime? Prepare to struggle with simple directions!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: I keep seeing this game and I want to know what\u2019s beyond the opening wait timer.</strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Guess you\u2019ll have to play and find out!<br/><br/><strong>Q: Can you guys remove the 1-hour opening wait timer?</strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>No, it\u2019s tied to other important code and removing it crashes the whole game.<br/><br/><strong>Q: What about the 5 hour time limit per play session?</strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>No.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Can you make it so it saves my progress at least?</strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>No.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Can you at least reduce the timer or make it less punishing.</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> Listen here you little puke, if you want to play a videogame that doesn\u2019t have a 1-hour long punishment wait timer for every time you mess up, or a videogame that doesn\u2019t make you read a bunch of boring directions, or a videogame that doesn\u2019t close out on you and forget all your progress after every 5 hours, you can play any other game on the internet. We spent a lot of time making this videogame and our parents are very proud of us and our friend Peter said it is a good game so it doesn\u2019t matter what you think and we\u2019re not going to change anything.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T02:27:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d91/d9132afbd8ab67b7cc48a69cc9067034.jpg", "website": "https://www.seempoint.com/echeese", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seemingly Pointless"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Seemingly Pointless"], "esrb_rating": null}
