Naturally, it's a very rare item, since the grubs have a very slow metabolism and food is scarce, but by farming Glowing Fruits from trees fertilized with Gel (a peculiar form of water unique to Gomma), it is possible to accelerate the production of excrement. Grubs are pacific, just put the fruits in front of them and wait for it. But remember to check the air purifier and to stay warm, many have lost their lives to the cold or toxins in the air.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T03:22:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/582/5826fbd2badbc293eadd26f46b2d996a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tutulio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
