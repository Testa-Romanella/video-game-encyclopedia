{"id": 919177, "slug": "hoo-2", "name": "Hoo?", "name_original": "Hoo?", "description": "Hoo? is a browser-playable solo journaling tarot RPG based on Anamnesis. It was created for the Anamnesis Jam.\r\n\n<p>As you progress through the four main chapters of <strong>Hoo?</strong>, you will use the imagery and descriptions of the tarot deck to answer questions about your character to build up a story of your past. Finally, in the fifth chapter, you will choose a card from the Major Arcana to represent your character's present and complete your story.</p>\r\nArt\r\n<p>This game contains more than 80 original works of art including a full 78 card tarot deck: the <strong>Hoo? Deck</strong> with full text descriptions of the cards, traditional meanings and amusing modern meanings.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about the creation of the deck on my website:<br/></p>\n<p>http://ratfactor.com/hoo/deck<br/></p>\r\nCreate your story!\r\n<p>A printable HTML summary at the end of the game gives you the complete transcript of your answers divided into chapters appropriate for printing and pinning on your fridge at home.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to being fun for its own sake, the story you create could also be the back-story for a character in a table-top RPG game or any kind of fiction story. (Wow, now you can get to that novel you've always been meaning to write!)<br/></p>\r\nA note on save/resume\r\n<p>Though the idea is to play straight through, <strong>Hoo?</strong> attempts to save and resume at any point to survive a browser refresh or even a re-visit days later. The game always resumes at the start of a \"chapter\".</p>\n<p>(It may appear that you need to draw some prompt inspiration cards again, but do not be alarmed. The original prompt question and your answer will re-appear for editing once you reach the text entry area.)</p>\n\r\nColophon\r\n<p>All artwork was drawn in Krita with a decade-old Wacom Intuos drawing tablet. The art took about two months to create. The game itself took several weeks.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was written in Vim from a blank file using nothing but HTML and JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries). It ended up a  bit of a rat's nest as the deadline loomed and there are certainly some things I would do differently if I were to start it again. Feel free to view the source (a single index.html file) to see how it's made.\u00a0Save/resume\u00a0uses the browser's <em>localStorage</em>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the entire concept, the question prompts for the minor arcana chapters were taken (and then tweaked) from the original Anamnesis (CC BY 4.0).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T15:58:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f7/1f7b133c88dc6cb7580a869b8a63a74e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ratfactor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
