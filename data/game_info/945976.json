Prel has accidentally set off on a journey! While it's haunting for her, it should be some light-hearted rage gaming for the player! Join Prel as she races down the hall of the dead!</p>\n<p>Please Note: This is my first unity project and I did not plan out the story from the beginning. This game was made for fun, and I haven't polished the game as this is my first 3D game as well. I hope you can enjoy the game, and that there aren't any game-breaking bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T12:53:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21b/21ba97296ebfef4eddae861271c2e577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CinnamonSweet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
