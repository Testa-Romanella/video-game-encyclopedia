The brief for this project was to demonstrate a simple game prototype with a core dynamic (In our case, spatial reasoning) with several supporting game mechanics. My role in the development of this game was the puzzle mechanics, such as moving blocks, rotating wheels and door logic. As well as various feedback systems like readable signs, camera movement and the objectives list in the top right of the screen. Note that the game works best in enlarged screen mode.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T09:10:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/869/8693f80fea7bbdde8942ab32e094cc44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LouisBarton"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
