The game was released in the United States, in 2000 and in 2008 and is the only game in the main series to be released outside Japan. A version of the game was also released on mobile phones.<br />\nRhapsody, along with its sequels, are considered musical RPGs, meaning in place of FMV cutscenes, there are musical numbers, complete with vocals. The game is also known for its &quot;overwhelming cuteness&quot; and low level of difficulty. Although this may make the game seem geared towards a younger audience, in Japan, the game and series in general has seen much success.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T08:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/645/645b24941a0fc989809ec0c44261e965.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 337, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Nippon Ichi Software"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
