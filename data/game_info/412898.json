Each of them is convinced that maybe, just maybe, the person across from them is someone\u00a0very\u00a0special, but only by surviving this date will they find out.</p>\n<p>Two players take on the role of hapless Daters trying to find a genuine connection in this wild world, and one or more players take the role of Cruel Fates that throw increasingly improbable obstacles in their way. Can you find love amidst lost reservations, freak thunderstorms, wild animal attacks, and burning buildings? Only one way to find out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T03:51:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/449/4490b6da6632afc9f752d4d83b58f633.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Off Guard Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
