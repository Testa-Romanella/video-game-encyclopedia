Theme is \"mouse\".<br/></p><p>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>USE THE DIRECTIONAL KEYS or<br/>USE THE MOUSE - HOLDING LMB or<br/>USE THE LEFT STICK OF A GAMEPAD or</p><p>Beat the mouse before it eats all the food.<br/>Either drive the mouse into traps (and get points) or catch up to it for a small amount of damage.<br/>When the mouse's HP - the red bar - is empty you win.<br/>If the mouse eats all the food you lose. The mouse cannot eat food while being chased (mouse turns red).<br/><br/>The game probably still has some bugs left but try to have fun.</p><p>Edit: New binaries uploaded. FPS limit is now enabled. New sources uploaded.</p><p>EDIT 2: Linux binaries now uploaded. I couldn't really test the Linux version properly since I have an Optimus GPU. Sorry for the late addition.</p><p>EDIT3: MIT licensed source code repository can be found here: https://github.com/eye776/mousetrap-godot<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a97/a9737b2cc68ac4a56df2501a645a3a61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["eye776"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
