The weapons system being tested includes one weapon, ironically. I programmed the weapon to shoot different bullet types.\u00a0One bullet type\u00a0damages the enemies, a second\u00a0destroys antennas, the third\u00a0freezes the enemies, and the fourth pushes physics objects.</p>\n<p>My contributions to this project are, everything, excluding the art and the base movement for the player character.
