I wanted to know if it could be done, and if so, how easily. What kind of issues would I encounter, and how manageable would they be ? Would the limited capabilities of the hardware be a problem ? </p><p>I don't know if I'd do it again, but I'm glad to have done it, it was a lot of fun, and very satisfying.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/300/300e4d8b24a6f3e7b8bd7af3e8361ec6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piers Bishop"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
