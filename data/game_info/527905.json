Our game is a doom style fps dungeon-crawler incorporating a bunch of the modifiers throughout the game and utilizing the theme of 'Suprise' through many chests and random surprises. The modifiers we included were</p>\n<p>\u00a0- <strong>Xephos and Honeydew</strong> - Make a game that involves digging. Through the progression through the levels of 'digging' through</p>\n<p>- <strong>Landlord's Super</strong> - Your character can drink a nice, cold pint. Through the health and stamina consumable.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Caveblazers\u00a0 </strong>- Live. Die. Repeat. Will would love it if you made a roguelike!
