BEETLES have a hard time moving across MOUNTAIN and, as dictated by scripture, no BEETLE may walk on WATER.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- The BEETLES you can recruit are:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. Farmers: Will gather FOOD from FIELD</p>\n<p>2. Soldiers: Will engage in BEETLE BATTLE</p>\n<p>3. Miners: Will gather ROCK from MOUNTAIN</p>\n<p>4. Lumberjacks: Will gather WOOD from FOREST</p>\n<p>5. Archers: Will engage in BEETLE BATTLE from a SAFE distance.</p>\n<p>- When you are relatively safe, prioritize gathering RESOURCE.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>~~~~~~~KIDZ KORNER ~~~~~~~</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Little BEETLE bottle BATTLE features BATTLE and is therefore NOT for KIDS.
