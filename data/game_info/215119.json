Instead, use the hardcoded ones and smile! Works with a controller? You tell me-- I never tried!<br/>- Gameplay that lasts the exact duration of the looping soundtrack, for which you have complete mastery over the volume levels.<br/>- Altogether unnecessary toggle to switch off post-processing visual effects.

Bask in performant glory.<br/>- Enough rounds to qualify as \"several\" rounds.\u00a0Count them: FOUR-- not one, not two, not seventy-three, but FOUR rounds of progression!
