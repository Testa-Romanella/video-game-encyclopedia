{"id": 109457, "slug": "flux-mars-ashton", "name": "Flux (Mars Ashton)", "name_original": "Flux (Mars Ashton)", "description": "<p>FLUX is a fidget-focused rhythm game where players define their own patterns. Time key presses as you see fit and ride to your own rhythm by personalizing the game's music playlist.</p>\n<p>Depending on the chosen game mode, players can maintain a Flux value that represents your current speed and the volume of the current music track by pressing keys on the keyboard or typing out entire words. Current modes include:</p>\n<ul><li>Freestyle: WASD/Arrow Keys to boost Flux</li><li>Challenge: Randomly cycled letters to boost Flux</li><li>Spelling: Randomly selected words to boost Flux</li></ul>\n<p>There is no end to this road. Cruise along at your own pace, stop and go as you please. The end goal for this game is to allow players to simply chill, relax, and find a meditative state within the experience. For fans of 80s retro aesthetics, retro wave and cyberpunk themes this task will be easier to accomplish with Flux.</p>\n<p>In order to add your own music you must have the following: an mp3 format music file, the file renamed to \"track1\", \"track2\" or \"track3\", and finally the file must be added to the game's included Music folder. Once the game is run it'll automatically load up these tracks sequentially as you begin to cruise. If you want to play another song, simply stop cruising and begin again to \"skip\" that track!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a731098facda68aca496b3ae38d8aa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mars Ashton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
