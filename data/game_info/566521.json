If you have, then you've played our Capture the Flag game before! If not, read the rules below.<br/><br/>How To Play:<br/>The goal of the game is for each team to grab the other team\u2019s flag and run it back to their own flag to score a capture. If members of the other team enter your team\u2019s zone, you can send them to \u201cjail\u201d by tagging them. Players can be freed from jail when a teammate touches one of the \"jail release boxes,\" placed inside enemy lines. First team to capture 5 flags, or have the most flags captured when the time runs out, are the match winners!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T03:37:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/062/062c12a8e2dc8b721c31117c6956d186.jpg", "website": "https://www.ripstargaming.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ripstar Gaming"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ripstar Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
