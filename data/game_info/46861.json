Your snake moves where you point your mouse and every time you eat a new point-ball you get longer. All the balls you have collected moves the way it follows and copies your movements, so you need to be careful not to crush into it. See how long you can get before you fail.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/1965ef3928c36437f41e8e0b239eb6c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Carrot Productions"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
