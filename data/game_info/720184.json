It was made for the Historically Accurate Game Jame 5.</p>\n<p>In Fenlander, you play as an ordinary resident of the fenlands of East Anglia in the medieval period, trying to smoke enough eels to pay your rent. Life seems simple: there's reeds to be cut, peat to be dug and eels to be fished for. But getting the right balance between those activities can be a matter of life and death, as can learning from and interacting with your fellow villages and the beautiful, dangerous, ever-shifting landscape around you. The fens are ancient, with reeds that seem to whisper of things we have long forgotten - but for all that, they never stop changing.</p>\n<p>The game is text-based, with an original soundtrack and location art.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd18a98fca8bdca991ff0f19e1dfe432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jubal Barca"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
