{"id": 372623, "slug": "captain-bones", "name": "Captain Bones", "name_original": "Captain Bones", "description": "The game is about Captain Bones being a great captain while he was a regular pirate crew member. It is an open world and survival game that takes place in the atmosphere of charming pirate islands, all hand-crafted.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the game, you can generate new vehicles and weapons with materials collected from the environment to survive. You can also make your raft and explore new islands. But beware, Captain Bones is still a sought-after pirate, with navy troops everywhere. He also has a curse, which often leaves him in difficult situations.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBy developing good relations with local people, you can find enough money to own your ship and crew. In this way, you can become the captain of your ship and the most feared pirate of the high seas. But beware, because the high seas are even more dangerous. And now you have a crew to feed. Perhaps instead of sinking ships, collecting the materials inside them may be more profitable.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTry to build a strong crew and make the right decisions. Show them who's the best captain. Maybe one day you can beat the curse and set sail for a new life.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-18T14:52:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/232/23205d7861340851c95f445713619596.jpg", "website": "http://worldofpoly.com/captain-bones", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sayg\u0131n Karahan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sayg\u0131n Karahan"], "esrb_rating": null}
