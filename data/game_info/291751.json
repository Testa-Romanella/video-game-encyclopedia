We developed this in an 8 hour game jam and even though the graphics are unfinished and the overall game is unpolished, it came out as playable and even a little enjoyable to play.<br/></p>\n<p>You can play with up to 4 players against each other. Each player is a customer in a restaurant, where penguins serve you food and your primal goal is to eat more food than your enemy players. You have 60 seconds to shove the most food into your character, that the penguins are bringing out to the diner. The penguins get controled by placing arrows on the floor. You can place three arrows at max, but can't place two over each other. Also, when placing a new arrow after you placed three, the first one gets removed and so on.</p><p>The arrows are placed with the A, B, X, Y buttons on the controller, your finger is moved with the analog stick.<br/></p>\n<p>There are three types of food: The normal one, rewarding 100 points, the bad one taking 50 points off and the super food rewarding 300 points.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T05:00:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a98/a98ac64ff125740fc1818ef31c30d0cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vollkorn Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
