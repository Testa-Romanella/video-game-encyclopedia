The game is a text-based story with hyperlinks providing players with a choice of different actions to take in the game. The premise is that you are thrust into an alien sports game without any clue of how to play and you make decisions based on very little information in order to try and win. I wanted to lean into the absurdity of my story's premise and make the game feel very random which should make the playthrough engaging and funny for the player. I incorporated random elements using tracery code so that each\u00a0play through can be unique.\u00a0In this vein, the actual ways that a player wins the game of Absurdball are not the most predictable or expected. I want the player to realize that in order to win they must submit to the absurd nature of the game and make their decisions with a sense of reckless abandon. <em>Absurdball</em> intends to be destabilizing and a bit off the wall. The player should not feel comfortable playing it and at no point should they feel confident that they will win, or even survive the match. \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T19:25:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/782/7820b1f0493180e9738bbfe4b69a6030.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cyborgtxter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
