The game was produced by professors, designer, developers, students and subject matter experts from Parsons School of Design NYC, The NYC Media Lab, and the NY/NJ Baykeeper.<br/><br/>Experience the Trash Museum and learn how pollution affects marine life, then enter the bathysphere and sink down into the Hudson River. You are then an underwater explorer who helps clean up the trash you see and build the beginning of an oyster reef.<br/> <br/>Swim through and explore The Hudson River Bottom. Watch fish swim by and experience the cleaner water when the oyster reef grows over time. One oyster can filter 50 gallons of polluted water a day! We can help them by picking trash up and throwing it into trashcans. Then we can set oyster cages and gather oysters in cages to encourage other oysters to attach themselves and build a natural reef barrier for cities like New York and Jersey City.<h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><ul><li><strong>Immersive Gameplay:</strong> Trash items from dumped glass, plastic, and construction materials are on display and tell us why they are harmful to marine life.
