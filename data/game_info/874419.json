To look at artifacts from Earth of course! These extraterrestrials don't know much about the relics, nor do they know how to operate and maintain a museum with over <strong>50 rooms and exhibits</strong>, so they need someone to show them the ropes, literally and figuratively.  Take up a job at the museum and help these aliens learn about Earth from a real-life Earthling! If you gain enough experience working here, you may become the Curator!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are currently <strong>66 rooms in total</strong>, including <strong>6 secret rooms</strong> hidden in the museum walls. Not all floors will be available to you when you are first employed at the museum. As you advance yourself by doing your daily tasks and jobs for your alien coworkers, you will earn keys to <strong>unlock rooms</strong>, including your own office! You will also <strong>earn furniture</strong> to <strong>decorate your office</strong> with by completing these job quests.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Customizing your own office<br/></li><li>Completing daily tasks for your job<br/></li><li>Earning points for tasks and quests<br/></li><li>Helping characters with quests<br/></li><li>Collecting Keys to unlock new rooms/exhibits<br/></li><li>Advancing your career/title<br/></li><li>Free rein to explore the museum any time </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T03:37:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a1/7a16b1902600289eb0f0905b97890fe4.jpg", "website": "http://www.speedtrapstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Speedtrap Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Speedtrap Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
