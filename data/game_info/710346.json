Human science has advanced so much that now research has gone into bringing back the dead. After years and years of setbacks and failures, an organization is finally close to achieving this goal. What should have been a day for celebration however quickly turned into a disaster. This morning, an overzealous scientist who wanted to hurry along the research in order to revive his dead daughter ended up completing the research ahead of time. What he didn\u2019t know is that he miscalculated valuable data to stabilize the machine. As a result, a massive explosion occurred affecting the entire world and causing all who were in the blast to transform. Humanity\u2019s wish for the dead to come back has finally come true in the worst possible way. Now the world is infested with hordes of undead, hellbent on having the living join their ranks. Fortunately for you however, your job as a technician kept you underground and out of the blast\u2019s range. Armed with only your trusty flashlight, you must traverse through this hellscape and make it to safety.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Awkward Meeting Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>\"Echoes of Time\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\"Thunder Dreams\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>\"Crinoline Dreams\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Grungy Screen Background made by dklon:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/grungy-title-screen-background<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T09:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/351/3510df895858921b03ffbd1684e3339d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["amarti95"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
