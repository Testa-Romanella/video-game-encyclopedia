I challenged myself to create my own render engine, and it ended up pretty bad. But I think it's still a fun game!</p>\n<p>Your the arrow, and you need to survive and shoot your enemies!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>SPACE to shoot</li></ul>\r\nLevels\r\n<p>I coded a simple level manager. In the menu of the game you can press \"b\" to open it. Enter the path to a file you want to save the level in (the standard file-extension is \".sthlvl\", but others work too), and hit enter. A window should pop up with lots of buttons. Press buttons to toggle their state (red=wall, grey=no wall). Close the window to save.</p>\n<p>When you want to play one of your one levels, press \"o\" in the menu and select the file your level is saved in.</p>\r\nGithub:\r\n<p>Github - Genius1512</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:45:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c93/c9310219f5da36fc4917ff659b895762.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Genius1512"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
