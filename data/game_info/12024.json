{"id": 12024, "slug": "insurgency", "name": "Insurgency", "name_original": "Insurgency", "description": "<p>Insurgency is a first-person shooter, which provides players with both PvP and co-op multiplayer experience. Unlike other shooters, Insurgency features a hardcore gameplay lacking the on-screen crosshair, health and armor indications, and mini-maps. For the more, each weapon instantly kills other players with one shot in the head and with the maximum of 4 shots in the body, which is quite realistic. As far as the action is set in the timeframes of the Iraq War, the two opposing sides are U.S. troops and Iraqi rebels. The gameplay is divided into 9 PvP modes (Push, Firefight, Skirmish, Ambush, Occupy, Infiltrate, Flashpoint, and Elimination) and 5 co-op modes (Checkpoint, Hunt, Survival, Outpost, and Conquer). PvP matches are held according to 9 various scenarios (depending on the chosen game mode) with the maximum of 32 player count (16 for both sides). To start a match, players have to select a character class and proper equipment. In the co-op game mode, players are offered to compete with AI during the completion of a specific game objective.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2014-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1a1/1a17e9b6286edb7e1f1e510110ccb0c0.jpg", "website": "https://www.newworldinteractive.com", "rating": 3.42, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 299, "owned": 6071, "beaten": 193, "toplay": 44, "dropped": 559, "playing": 30}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 945, "suggestions_count": 555, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 949, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["New World Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["New World Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
