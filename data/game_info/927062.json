The feeling of being trapped is false, as much as need to follow voice directions, because in the end it's just a game. But I found it to be an interesting perspective on real life situations and I hope it served as some sort of reminder that \"an outside view\" on situation might actually be the key to it's solution.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T10:59:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d12/d12e61855eaad4b6c4a2c875d973d44c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["atarasova"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
