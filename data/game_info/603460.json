There are no interactions, it's simply a walking simulator showcasing the environment.\u00a0My assets are modeled with Maya and textured with Substance Painter. The concept started with a character I designed which has a techy body and a ritual like mask. I thought a theme of technology and satanic ritual similar to that of Doom can make a great environment. Needs a lot of optimization but with the limited time I'm satisfied with the result. But nevertheless, enjoy the final scene!</p>\n<p>External assets I used:</p>\n<p>Gothic statues:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/gothic-statues-169428</p>\n<p>Lanterns:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/modular-medieval-...</p>\n<p>Old lamp: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/old-lamp-95730</p>\n<p>Skeleton:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/skeleton-p...</p>\n<p>Vegetation: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/book-of-the-d...</p>\n<p>Mary Statue: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/mary-statue-11752...</p>\n<p>Battery pack: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-battery-pack...</p>\n<p>Horse statue: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/horse-statue-52025</p>\n<p>FPS controller: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/modular-first-person-control...</p>\n<p>Rocks: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/rock-package-118182</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T09:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c8/5c824358fd6743e659929f84e59c73d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Will"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
