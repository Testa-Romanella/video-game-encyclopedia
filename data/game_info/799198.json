The theme was \"Death is only the beginning\". The source is available on my Github.<br/><br/>Due to a busy week work-wise, the scale of this project had to be strictly limited, so this acts more like a kind of demo than a full-fledged game. More polish will be added at a later time, and parts of the code need optimisation as well. My main goal with this project was to experiment with timelines as well as the new Unity input system, two features with which I had no prior experience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T18:13:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af8/af8b76c70f2091fcbe87e6096dc024fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Roxanoel"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
