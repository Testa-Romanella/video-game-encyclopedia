It's hard. It's really hard and it's going to put your ambidexterity to the test. Choose from 8 characters, 8 levels, there's like 5 catchy 8-bit songs, I don't know, what are you waiting for? It's gonna be super fun and all your friends will think you're really cool when you drop Watergate trivia on them like how G Gordon Liddy ate a rat once. Anyway, call your friends, invite them over, pour some glasses of your favorite beverages, and play some Watergate Xtreme.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/994/994ed5b3ce85d027b6c0a0bc2748e4b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["unclehighbrow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
