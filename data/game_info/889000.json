So we will be opting out and making a Windows version only. We do hope that is acceptable!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Icon - Kellett</p>\n<p>Music - Jonathan So</p>\n<p>SFX - Juhani Junkala</p>\n<p>All art, other than what was listed above, were made by Kevin O'Ryan from WakianTech.
