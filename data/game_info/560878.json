Features Victorian silliness as you maneuver your way through events and become the wealthiest socialite.</p>\n<p>The fancier the event, the more money is on the line to win or lose. Your skills will help you win by a wider margin, but failing an event will increase your skills. Manage your risks to level up and outclass NPCs without going bankrupt yourself.</p>\n<p>Created by....<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Liz Fiacco</p>\n<p>\u2764 Contributing Writers \u2764...<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Julia Kernan<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mark Burroughs<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brian Handy<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jessica Kernan<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jordan Sanchez<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Daniel Harrison</p>\n<p>Music &amp; SFX...<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Courante - Bach<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gavotte en Roundeau - Bach\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0https://www.freemusicpublicdomain.com/royalty-free-classical-music/<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Failure 3 - FunWithSound<br/>https://freesound.org/people/FunWithSound/sounds/394898/<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Swoop - willc2_45220<br/>https://freesound.org/people/willc2_45220/sounds/73600/<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bullet Shells - CGEffex<br/>https://freesound.org/people/CGEffex/sounds/158993/</p>\n<p>This game is built with Unity and spite.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T03:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b95f17bcb566ed201c7bf2c70237605.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liz Fiacco"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
