But there has been, I feel, a struggle for a lot of people to go from recognizing what their ADHD does to them, to finding some ways to deal with the problems it presents.</p>\n<p>So I made this twine as a collection of things that have helped me, and will hopefully help you too, even just a little. Or, perhaps, help you find new, different techniques that help you with your ADHD even if mine don't help you. <br/></p>\n<p><em>This is a project made in Twine, which means you simply download the file, and open and play it right in your browser!
