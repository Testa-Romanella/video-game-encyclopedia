A bad guy whose name is spelled differently in almost every instance has unleashed his army of skeletons, goblins, and evil humans to destroy the city of Eastgate adjacent to his castle, turning once-lush fields into barred deserts. He intends to conquer the rest of the world and impose authoritarian rule and must be stopped!<br/><br/>And so Prince Eric sets out on a quest to recruit three other heroes to help him: Magdeline Spellmore the mage, Dirk the gladiator and newly emancipated slave, and Ermina the fairy stoat.<br/><br/>This game has an intentional aesthetic of looking like it was made by a teenager inexperienced in making games on his computer back in 2003 or so; in fact, it's a near exact recreation of the pixel art style I used when not directly aping another game (such as Dragon Warrior) or limiting the colors per sprite. It was entered into a contest to make use only of the OHRRPGCE's earliest technical capabilities, hence my leaning so heavily into its simplicity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:29:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a44/a4419e6146fb5086b8e2208407ed5198.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nathan of Cheeseforge"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
