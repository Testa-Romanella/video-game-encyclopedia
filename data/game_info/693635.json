The town of Chebelish had been isolated after the accident 50 years ago.\r\n </p>\n<p>Surveillance fly-overs report some activity and signs of life but unfortunately, the survivors developed severe alterations from radiation sickness. Your mission is to seek and destroy mutants while looking for healthy survivors.\r\n </p>\n<p>You have been dropped by parachute near the old bridge that was destroyed after the radiation event.\r\n </p>\n<p>Current research indicates that radiation levels have dropped sufficiently to allow for a Cobra mission.\r\n </p>\n<p>You will meet your team on the beach near the river mouth. They have arrived an hour earlier by stealthy means and have begun prepping for the mission. Some of them have taken up sentinel positions near possible target areas and will wait for reinforcements.\r\n </p>\n<p>Keep clear of the mutants and let your team do their work. They will follow your lead.\r\n </p>\n<p>Weather can be unpredictable and make the mission riskier.\r\n </p>\n<p>Your Flashlight and Pistol are your only equipment. Choose wisely when to use each.\r\n </p>\n<p>If you feel too sick from radiation contact with mutants, come back to the beach for some first-aid.</p>\n<p>Spoiler Hint: The survivors might join the fight if you can find them and instruct them to follow you. They also have a bonus first aid kit at their campsite.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:08:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/681a26fe1e4e128e6e319d7ed4b695ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 402, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mafuta Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
