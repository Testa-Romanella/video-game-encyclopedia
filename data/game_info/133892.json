TURN ON FULLSCREEN TO HAVE THE ENTIRE GAME ON ITCH.IO !!!</p><p>This game was made for Ludum Dare 37. The theme was \"One room\".</p><p>You are getting back home and you finally have time for some intense gaming session. However, the entire world seems to be against you: your mom wants you to go outside, people are calling you, the window opens... You will have to manage all these problems in your room to be able to play.</p><p>The controls are:</p><p>- WASD to control the alien in the game.</p><p>- Mouse to react to events and eat (because you did buy stuff before locking yourself inside your room).</p><p>Do not forget to eat if you want to be strong enough to play but do not eat too much.</p><p>When you have things to do in your room, you are not able to play anymore. So, be fast enough!</p><p>DO NOT FORGET TO EAT, OTHERWISE IT SLOWS YOUR GAMING CAPABILITIES !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8c/f8c6abef8fafd53a17e92f2c0e04f5aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Aun"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
