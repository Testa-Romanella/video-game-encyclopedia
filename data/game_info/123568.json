You must utilize an array of different arcane abilities to help you survive, such as Arcane Teleport, Arcane Spear, and Arcane Lift that all use up mana. To gain mana the player must kill enemies with their main spell which costs no mana. To finish the game the player must collect 500 mana, and the game ends when the player dies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/715/7153840741715670b50475af0e97295f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Levi Stenton"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
