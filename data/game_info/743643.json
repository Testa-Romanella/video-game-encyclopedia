Immerse yourself among pretty lights, lasers and visual effects while you dance the night away! This VR experience was made by ravers, for ravers during a time where we just need to have a good dance in our isolationist world.<br/><br/>- Import your own music, select songs in game at the DJ booth, fast forward through long mixes or mute the music so you can play your own from an external program. You can't actually DJ in this experience unfortunately.   <br/>- Play with a beautiful visual effects as \"flow toys\" while you dance--similar to poi. There are buttons around the scene that trigger special effects.<br/>- Explore different sections and heights of the club as you dance next to other partying NPCs<br/>- See your body in the scene for that extra immersion factor<br/><br/>Please enjoy and have fun in your own personal nightclub! <br/><br/>Notes on importing music:<br/>Must be in .ogg file format - place in the project folder:  ...[GameDirectory]\\Cubic Neon Nightclub_Data\\StreamingAssets\\Music\\.. ). There are plenty of free music file converters (from mp3, etc) to .ogg on the web.<br/><br/>FOR AVG VIRUS PROTECTION USERS:<br/>AVG and perhaps other virus software tends to throw a false positive for an \"IDP.Generic\" malware for this application despite our best efforts. The .exe file should simply be added to your exception list.
