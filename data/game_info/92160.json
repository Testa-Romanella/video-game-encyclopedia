Can you guide your fragile craft through 13 increasingly ridiculous levels? Maybe. Without swearing? Not a chance.</p>\n<p>Gameplay<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the kind of thing you're in for. You'll definitely be as good at it as me, don't worry. Those bullets, they're basically for show.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements<br/>\n<p>\r\nAny half-way decent PC or Mac should run Thrunt! without much trouble. The game launcher will allow you to choose lower graphics settings if your frame rate is struggling. Lower settings will disable some effects such as motion blur. If you do run into unexpected performance problems, or issues running the game at all, then please let me know.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/255/2552c85050f39019d09c5f8372d15196.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mugs Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
