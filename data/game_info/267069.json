HINT: The spray will stick to the pie remnant and glow blue under the UV light.</li><li>Using the little brush keep 'dusting' the object until a clear fingerprint appears.</li><li>Get a clear photograph of the fingerprint.</li></ol>\n<p>There will probably not be any updates to this project... however I may well continue this in an actual game...</p>\n<p>P.S. Sorry about the voice over.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/551/5516fe0c8b578c6256cb69c08fcacc20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MadManMike"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
