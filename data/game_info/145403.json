However, one false step and now he finds himself in a weird maze, full of water, lava, ice, balls and traps. Only you can guide him out of that mad world!</strong></p>\n<p>Inspired by\u00a0<strong>Chip's Challenge</strong>, this game is a nice\u00a0<em>mostly</em>-fast paced game where you go through a maze and solve puzzles and get all the master keys to open the door to the next maze. Each one has a lot more stuff to do, so keep your attention up, more can come, but you can do it! :D</p>\n<p>1. Is this game free?</p>\n<p>Yes! Go ahead and download that bad boy. No strings attached, no sneaky hooded man trying to sell you loot boxes.</p>\n<p>2. I wanna donate to you, this game ruled.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, though I'm still working on getting the money thing done. A lot of papers to sign, business big man in big suits with a happy face button on their sharp hat.</p>\n<p>3. Can I eat the keys?</p>\n<p>Hmm,\u00a0 I can make a chocolate one. How about that?</p>\n<p>4. I wanna check more of your stuff!</p>\n<p>Go to my studio's discord, Coffee Firework Development, where we talk all day about stuff nobody cares about.
