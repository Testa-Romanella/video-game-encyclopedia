This game will be dotPNGs first game and hope it will be sucessful. This will be a Unity3D Game, but will not be developed by Unity Technologies in any way shape or form. Anyways, In your typical Managment Simulation, you'd expect money to be the primary resource, or in some cases, the only resource. Well here there will be multiple resources, some of which are actually required to make an actual building. A few of the resources included in the game are, Iron, Copper, Silver, Gold, Cash (USD) and then you have the resources you will sell, Molten Iron, Copper, Silver, and Gold. </p><p>We just released our first test to make sure the game works on other systems!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49e/49e25b87a3ba0766c005995932d34fc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["dotPNGStudios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
