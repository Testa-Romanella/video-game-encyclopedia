Help Santa and his elves to collect and pack the toys by tapping on a toy as it comes off the factory production line.<br/><br/>Be careful though, because any missed toy will fall off the conveyor belt and break. <br/><br/>Sometimes the factory suffers a mechanical problem and broken toys find their way on to the belt - don't collect these!<br/><br/>The game requires sharp wits and good hand/eye coordination, with each level more challenging that the last.<br/><br/>Don't worry though, elves, Rudolph, snowmen and even Santa will lend a hand from time to time.<br/><br/>Happy holidays!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:18:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d56d00f53ee4bef980f27b46d8c760.jpg", "website": "http://meyume.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Meyume"], "genres": ["Action", "Family"], "publishers": ["MEYUME"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
