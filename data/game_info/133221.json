(XBOX controller: X = Z, Y = X)</li><li>Tutorial! Yay!</li><li>Music and more pew pew (dual purpose beatboxing!)</li><li>Rebalanced by toning down difficulty, less hardcore</li><li>Stamped out bugs</li></ul>\n<p>The twist to this space shooter is that you reflect shots using a mirror shield, and that you have limited ammo so you can't shoot as you like. You recharge your ammo by getting hit by a\u00a0reflecting bullets, and your health regenerates slowly over time when shields are down. Enemies drop credits which can be used to purchase upgrades by travelling through the Gravity Well.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is endless!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a9/0a9e609a307279a660b952f315470840.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["randomphantom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
